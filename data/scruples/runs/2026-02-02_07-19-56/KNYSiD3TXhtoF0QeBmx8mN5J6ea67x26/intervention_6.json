Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy early, around four weeks, and then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months to announce, as that's common advice to reduce the risk of having to share a loss so soon after a positive announcement.\n\nThe author didn't voice their opinion to Hayley, just had internal thoughts and felt guilty about being judgmental. They sent a supportive message after the miscarriage. The key points here are the author's internal judgment versus actual actions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, thinking something doesn't necessarily make you wrong, especially if you don't act on those thoughts in a harmful way. The author didn't criticize Hayley publicly or privately, they supported her. The problem might be the internal judgment and feeling guilty for it. But in terms of \"wrongdoing,\" there's no direct harm done. \n\nHowever, the question is about being in the wrong. The author's judgment is based on a common practice, but everyone's circumstances are different. Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe they were more cautious the second time. The author's thoughts might stem from good intentions, but they should consider that others have different choices and circumstances. \n\nThe author is struggling with their own feelings of judgment, which is understandable. But unless they acted on those judgments in a harmful way, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The real issue is their self-perceived judgmentalness, but in terms of actual wrongdoing, there isn't any. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because they didn't act on their thoughts and supported Hayley. The internal judgment is a personal struggle but not a moral failing unless it leads to harmful actions.\n"
