Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author's coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy a few weeks into it, around four weeks. The author is wondering if Hayley was too hasty in announcing because, as the author knows, early pregnancies can be risky and it's common to wait until three months to announce to avoid the emotional impact of a possible miscarriage. The author feels judgmental about this but hasn't said anything to Hayley, just thinking about it.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA). The user who posted this thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So I have to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's intentions. They were happy for Hayley when the news was announced and supported her after the miscarriage. The author isn't spreading gossip or being cruel; they're just having internal thoughts. The question is about whether the author is wrong for thinking Hayley should have waited.\n\nThe key points here are about social etiquette regarding announcing pregnancies. The author's belief is that waiting until three months is the proper etiquette because of the higher risk of miscarriage. However, some people might choose to announce earlier for personal reasons, such as wanting to share their joy or because their first pregnancy was high risk and they might have felt more confident this time. \n\nHayley's first pregnancy was high risk, so maybe she and her husband felt that this time was different, or they wanted to be open about their journey. It's possible that they made an informed decision based on their personal circumstances and medical advice. The author's judgment is based on a general guideline, but each couple's situation is unique.\n\nThe author isn't acting on their judgment; they're just thinking it. They haven't criticized Hayley or spoken ill of her. Judging someone internally isn't necessarily wrong if it's done without malice and without affecting others. However, the author is questioning if their own feelings of judgment are misplaced. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people do announce early, and that's their choice. The author's concern is valid in that waiting can be more considerate, but it's not a rule set in stone. The author isn't in a position to dictate Hayley's choices, especially since Hayley might have had her own reasons. The author's feelings of judgment might stem from caring about Hayley's well-being, but they are still judgments. \n\nHowever, the author isn't causing harm by thinking it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. Since the author is reflecting on their own judgment and considering if they're being too critical, it's more about self-awareness than wrongdoing. The author is trying to process their own feelings without acting on them negatively.\n\nSo, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, because they're not acting on their judgment and are actually being supportive. The internal thoughts don't harm anyone, and questioning one's own judgment can be a sign of empathy. However, some might argue that even thinking it is being judgmental. But in the context of the question, the key is whether the author is in the wrong for their thoughts. Since they are not acting on it and are trying to be understanding, it's more about personal reflection than fault.\n"
