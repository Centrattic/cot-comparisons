Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker, Hayley, announcing her pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months to announce it, as that's what they thought was proper etiquette. The main question is whether the author's thoughts are judgmental and if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author says they didn't participate in any negative discussions and were genuinely happy for Hayley. They also sent a supportive message after the miscarriage. So their intentions seem good. They're not directly criticizing Hayley, just thinking to themselves about the timing of the announcement.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author is being unkind or judgmental. The author admits they feel judgmental but are trying not to express it. They're questioning their own thoughts. Since they didn't vocalize their opinion, there's no direct harm done. But maybe the act of thinking that way is still problematic?\n\nIn terms of social norms, people do announce pregnancies at different times. Some do it early, some wait until the first trimester. The author's belief that three months is the proper etiquette is based on the idea that early miscarriages are common. However, Hayley had already been through a high-risk first pregnancy, so maybe they were more confident this time. The author might not know that, though.\n\nThe author's internal conflict is about their own judgment, not Hayley's actions. Since they didn't act on it or spread their thoughts, are they in the wrong? It's possible that the author is being too hard on themselves. Everyone has thoughts, but as long as they don't act on them or harm others, they're not necessarily wrong. The author is reflecting and seeking validation, which shows self-awareness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's thoughts are their own, and they're trying to be supportive. They aren't acting unkindly or spreading negativity. The judgment is internal, and they're actually being empathetic in their actions.\n"
