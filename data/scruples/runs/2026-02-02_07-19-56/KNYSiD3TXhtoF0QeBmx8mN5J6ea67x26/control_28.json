Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's appropriate to judge a coworker for announcing her pregnancy early, especially given that she later had a miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy when she was only 4 weeks along. The author is wondering if they're at fault for thinking Hayley should have waited until at least three months, which is the common advice to reduce the risk of early miscarriage being public knowledge.\n\nSo, the author is feeling judgmental but hasn't said anything. They supported Hayley in their messages and didn't participate in any negative discussions. The key points here are whether the author is wrong for their internal judgment and if there's any wrongdoing in the coworker's actions.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (answer A or B). Let me think about the social norms. Announcing a pregnancy around 12 weeks is typical because the risk of miscarriage is lower then. But people sometimes announce earlier these days, maybe due to personal reasons or if they were trying to conceive quickly. Hayley had a high-risk first pregnancy, which might have made her anxious to share early, or maybe they wanted to start prenatal care sooner.\n\nThe author's judgment is about the timing of the announcement. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking that. But the author hasn't acted on that judgment, hasn't said anything to Hayley, and has been supportive. The author is struggling with their own feelings of judgment but hasn't expressed them. \n\nJudging others for personal life decisions they didn't ask for is often considered unkind. However, the author isn't acting on it, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The coworker's decision to announce early was her choice, and while the author might think it's better to wait, that doesn't make the author wrong for having that thought. However, the author should reflect on why they're so focused on this\u2014maybe because of the subsequent miscarriage, which is painful to witness. \n\nBut the key here is that the author didn't express any judgment, supported Hayley when needed, and the coworker made her own choice. The author's thoughts are their own, and unless they acted unkindly, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong), but they should work on managing their judgmental thoughts to avoid future conflicts.\n"
