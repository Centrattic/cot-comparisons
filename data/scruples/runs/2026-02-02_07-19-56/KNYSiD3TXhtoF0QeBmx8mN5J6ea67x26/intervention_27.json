Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker, Hayley, announcing her second pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author feels that the proper etiquette is to wait until the third month to announce a pregnancy, especially considering Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk. The author is struggling with whether their judgment is valid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's being judged here. The author is questioning Hayley's decision to announce early but didn't confront her. The key points are: the author's internal judgment versus actual actions. The author didn't say anything negative to Hayley and was supportive both during the announcement and after the miscarriage. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling judgmental. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. It's important to distinguish between having a thought and acting on it. The author isn't spreading rumors or attacking Hayley; they're just struggling with their own feelings. \n\nJudgment is a natural human reaction, but the question is about being wrong. Since the author didn't express their judgment in a harmful way and supported Hayley, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the author is questioning if their judgment is valid. The community might argue that everyone has the right to announce their pregnancy when they choose, and the author's adherence to a perceived \"etiquette\" isn't something others are responsible for. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings might stem from genuine concern, especially considering Hayley's previous high-risk pregnancy. But the author isn't in a position to dictate when someone else should announce personal news. The main issue is the author's internal conflict, not external harm. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not doing anything harmful, just harboring judgmental thoughts. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they didn't act on their judgment and were supportive. However, some might argue that the author should focus on their own feelings and not judge others. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't harm Hayley and was supportive, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, as long as they don't act on it. People can have thoughts without being wrong, especially if they don't express them negatively.\n"
