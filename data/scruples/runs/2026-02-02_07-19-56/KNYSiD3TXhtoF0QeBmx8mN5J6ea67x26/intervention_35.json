Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker announced her pregnancy too early, especially since she had a first child born a year ago and now had a miscarriage. The author didn't say anything to Hayley but is feeling judgmental and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points: The coworker announced at 4 weeks, which is early. The author knows that miscarriages are common in the first three months and thought the proper etiquette was to wait until three months. However, the author didn't voice their opinion, just had thoughts and sent support messages.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Traditionally, people often wait until the first trimester (around 12 weeks) to announce a pregnancy to reduce the risk of having to share the news of a loss. But some people choose to share earlier for personal reasons\u2014maybe they're excited, have a supportive community, or have medical reasons to share sooner. The author is judging Hayley's decision, even though they didn't say anything. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking this.\n\nThe author's intentions are good\u2014they sent support, didn't participate in gossip, and tried to be kind. However, the judgment itself is based on a personal belief about etiquette. The problem here is that the author is feeling judgmental without knowing Hayley's circumstances. Maybe Hayley had her reasons, like her first pregnancy being high-risk, but perhaps they wanted to celebrate early, or they felt comfortable with their workplace. The author's fault isn't in the judgment per se, but in assuming Hayley was wrong without knowing her situation.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author hasn't acted on their judgment (i.e., not criticized Hayley or spread their opinion), then their internal thoughts might not make them \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense. However, the question is about whether they're at fault for the judgment itself. But according to the \"AITA\" framework, it's about whether the person is being unreasonable. Since the author is self-aware and recognizes their judgment could be too harsh, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're being judgmental without understanding the context, that could be seen as wrong.\n\nWait, but the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because the author is being judgmental. If it's B (no), because they didn't act on it and are reflecting. The key is that the author is feeling judgmental but hasn't acted on it. In social terms, having a thought isn't in the wrong, but if the judgment is based on incorrect information or is unkind, then maybe they are wrong. However, the author is trying to be understanding and sent support, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they didn't act on their thoughts and are seeking to understand. But some might argue that the judgment itself is wrong, hence A.\n"
