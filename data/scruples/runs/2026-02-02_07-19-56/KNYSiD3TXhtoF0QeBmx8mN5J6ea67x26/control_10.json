Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a coworker, Hayley, who announced her second pregnancy very early\u2014only a few weeks along. Then she had a miscarriage, and the author is wondering if Hayley should have waited to announce until three months in because that's considered safer.\n\nThe author is feeling judgmental but hasn't said anything directly to Hayley. They were happy for her during the announcement and supportive after the miscarriage. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that Hayley should have waited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around announcing pregnancies. From what I know, traditionally, people often wait until the first trimester is over, around 12-13 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. So the author's thought that waiting until three months is proper etiquette makes sense. But is it wrong for the author to think that?\n\nBut then, the author isn't acting on that judgment. They didn't say anything to Hayley or criticize her publicly. They just have thoughts and feel maybe they're being too judgmental. The key here is whether having those thoughts makes them in the wrong. \n\nThe author is being introspective and recognizing their own judgment. They're aware that they could be too judgmental and are seeking validation. The fact that they're reflecting on their feelings and not acting on them might mean they aren't actually in the wrong. Also, Hayley's personal choice to announce early is her decision, and the author has no right to judge her without knowing her circumstances. Maybe there were personal reasons why Hayley announced early that the author isn't aware of. \n\nThe author is feeling bad for having those thoughts but hasn't acted on them. So the question is whether the thoughts themselves make them at fault. I think in this context, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not harming Hayley directly. They're just having internal thoughts, which is common and not necessarily wrong. However, they might need to work on not being judgmental, but that's more about their personal growth than being in the wrong in this situation.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Their judgmental thoughts are a personal issue they need to address, but they aren't actively wronging Hayley by just thinking them.\n"
