Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The author's coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks, which is before the typical three-month mark. The author feels that since Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk and miscarriages are common early on, it's more proper to wait until three months. But the author didn't say anything to Hayley and felt guilty for even thinking it.\n\nSo, first, I need to assess whether the author's judgment is justified. The author is not directly criticizing Hayley but is struggling with their own thoughts. The key points here are the etiquette around pregnancy announcements and the emotional impact. \n\nIn many cultures, the norm is to wait until the first trimester (about 12 weeks) when the risk of miscarriage is lower. However, people announce when they feel comfortable, especially if they've had previous complications. Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe she was cautious the first time. But this time, she might have been more confident or excited. \n\nThe author isn't spreading rumors or being cruel; they're just having internal thoughts. The question is whether those thoughts make them at fault. Since the author supported Hayley both times and didn't express negativity, their judgment alone might not make them in the wrong. However, the author is feeling judgmental, which is a personal issue. \n\nThe main point is whether the author's thoughts are inappropriate. Since they didn't act on them and were supportive, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author is being judgmental, hence A. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not if their thoughts are valid. Since they didn't harm anyone, the answer leans towards B.\n"
