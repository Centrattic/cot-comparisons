Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking the coworker should have waited to announce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy when she was only 4 weeks along. The author's concern is about the timing, as they thought the proper etiquette is to wait until three months. Then, when the miscarriage happened, the author felt a mix of emotions but didn't express any judgment.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for thinking Hayley should have waited. The author didn't actually say anything to Hayley, just had internal thoughts. The author is worried about being judgmental.\n\nI should consider the cultural norms around announcing pregnancies. I know that in many places, people wait until the first trimester is more secure, around 12 weeks, because miscarriages are more common before then. So the author's thought is actually aligned with common advice. But the coworker announced much earlier. The author isn't blaming Hayley for the miscarriage, just questioning the timing of the announcement.\n\nThe author didn't act on their thoughts, didn't spread judgment, and expressed support. Their internal judgment is what's causing guilt. But is internal judgment wrong? People often have thoughts they don't express. Unless the author made comments or contributed to a negative environment, their internal thoughts might not make them at fault.\n\nAlso, Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, which might have been considered in their decision to try again quickly. The author might not have all the information about their personal circumstances. So, the author's judgment is based on their own knowledge, but they don't know the full story.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for having those thoughts, as long as they didn't express them negatively. It's about personal opinion and etiquette, not an action that harmed others. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
