Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, which turned out to be a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking Hayley should have waited until three months to announce.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author didn't say anything negative to Hayley or others; they were supportive both times. The judgment is internal, thinking maybe the announcement was too early given the risk of early miscarriage, especially since her first pregnancy was high-risk. The author's question is whether they're at fault for having that thought, even though they don't express it.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author is struggling with their own judgment, but they haven't acted on it. They're wondering if their internal thought makes them wrong. The main issue here is about social etiquette versus personal judgment. The user argues that the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess that.\n\nIn general, people have different opinions on when to announce a pregnancy. Some do it early, some later. The author's belief is that waiting until three months is proper, which is a common practice because the risk is lower after 12 weeks. However, others might choose to announce earlier for their own reasons. The key here is that the author is not expressing this judgment publicly; it's an internal thought. They were supportive and empathetic, so their actions don't harm anyone. The author's guilt is about their own feelings rather than any action taken.\n\nThe user says the author is in the wrong. But I think the author isn't at fault because they didn't act on their judgment. Everyone has different perspectives, and having a thought doesn't make you wrong unless you act on it. The author is also empathetic, which is positive. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're just having a personal reflection without causing harm.\n"
