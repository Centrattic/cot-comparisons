Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy until three months along. The situation involves Hayley announcing her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author feels conflicted because they were happy for her initially but now have lingering thoughts about the timing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around announcing pregnancies. Traditionally, many people wait until the first trimester (around 12 weeks) because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. The author is thinking along these lines and feels that Hayley should have followed this etiquette. However, is it the author's place to judge? The author didn't express this judgment to Hayley or others; they just had the thought. \n\nThe key points here are the author's internal thoughts versus their actions. They didn't spread any judgment or criticize Hayley publicly or privately. They supported her when they found out about the miscarriage. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. \n\nJudging others' private decisions, even if they're based on societal norms, can be seen as problematic. People choose when to announce pregnancies for various reasons, and it's their personal decision. The author isn't causing harm by holding their opinion but is wondering if they're being too judgmental. \n\nHowever, the author isn't acting on their judgment. They're struggling with their own feelings of judgment but haven't expressed it. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong for having the thought, as everyone has personal opinions. The real issue would be if they expressed it in a hurtful way. Since they didn't, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut there's also a perspective that internal judgment is still judgment and can be harmful, even if unspoken. However, the question is about being in the \"wrong,\" which typically involves actionable harm. Since the author didn't act on their judgment, it's more about their internal conflict rather than wrongdoing. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
