Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy until three months along.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy very early, around 4 weeks. The author is wondering if it's wrong for her to think Hayley should have waited. The key points here are about social etiquette regarding pregnancy announcements and the emotional impact of a miscarriage.\n\nThe author mentions that they were happy for Hayley initially and supportive after the miscarriage, so there's no direct harm done. The question is about the author's judgment, not their actions. The user is asking if the author is being too judgmental, hence whether they are at fault (AITA).\n\nIn terms of etiquette, there's a common belief that announcing a pregnancy after 12 weeks is safer because the risk of miscarriage is lower. However, people choose when to announce for various reasons\u2014personal, cultural, or based on their previous experiences. Hayley had a high-risk first pregnancy, so maybe she and her husband wanted to share the news early despite the risks, possibly because they were aware of the potential and wanted to start receiving support early.\n\nThe author's judgment is about the timing, but it's important to recognize that this is a personal choice. The author isn't acting on that judgment, just thinking about it. However, the thought itself isn't harmful unless it's expressed. The author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, but the question is whether they're being too judgmental.\n\nIn such scenarios, it's often considered that people have different experiences and decisions. The fact that the author is reflecting on their judgment and acknowledges that they were supportive shows they're not being malicious. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author's thoughts are their own, and they haven't acted on them, but they're questioning their judgment, which is a personal reflection rather than an action against Hayley.\n"
