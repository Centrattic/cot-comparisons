Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy very early, around four weeks along. The author is wondering if that was too soon, especially since the first pregnancy was high-risk. Then Hayley had a miscarriage, which made the author feel even more judgmental about the timing of the announcement.\n\nThe key points here are about judgment and etiquette. The author acknowledges that they didn't express their thoughts to Hayley and was supportive both during the announcement and after the miscarriage. So the main issue is the internal thought process, not any actions taken against Hayley.\n\nNow, considering social norms, it's common to wait until the first trimester is further along (around 12 weeks) before announcing a pregnancy because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. However, people have different experiences and choices. The author's coworker chose to announce early, which might be her personal choice.\n\nThe author feels guilty about thinking Hayley should have waited. But is the author actually in the wrong? Well, the author didn't act on those thoughts. They didn't say anything judgmental to Hayley or others. The author was supportive and expressed sympathy after the miscarriage. The self-reflection here is about their own judgmental feelings, not any harmful actions.\n\nAlso, the author is questioning if their judgment is too harsh. It's important to recognize that people have autonomy over their bodies and decisions. The author isn't in a position to dictate Hayley's choices. However, the author is struggling with their own feelings of judgment, which is common but doesn't necessarily make them \"in the wrong.\"\n\nIn terms of AITA, the question is whether the author is at fault. Since they didn't act on their judgment and were supportive, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). The author's thoughts are their own and don't affect Hayley, but they should reflect on why they feel that way. Maybe it's about respecting others' choices even if they differ from personal opinions.\n"
