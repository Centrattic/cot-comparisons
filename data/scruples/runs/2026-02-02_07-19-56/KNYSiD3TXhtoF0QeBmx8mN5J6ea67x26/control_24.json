Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have delayed announcing her pregnancy. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Hayley announced her second pregnancy early, around 4 weeks along. She had a high-risk first pregnancy, and the office found out about the miscarriage after she announced. The author feels that announcing before three months is improper etiquette due to the risk of miscarriage, but they didn't say anything to Hayley. They feel guilty for their judgment.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't express their thoughts to Hayley or others. They supported her both times, sending messages of congratulations and support. The question is about whether the author is at fault for their internal judgment, not for any actions they took.\n\nThe author's own feelings about the timing of the announcement are based on their understanding of etiquette. But they didn't act on those feelings by criticizing Hayley. They're struggling with their own feelings of judgment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything harmful. They're having personal thoughts, which is normal. People often have judgments without acting on them. The fact that they didn't voice their opinion and still showed support is important. \n\nHayley's decision to announce early was her choice, and while others might have different opinions on timing, that's her personal decision. The author isn't in the wrong for thinking their own thoughts, as long as they didn't act on them in a way that harmed Hayley.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're being introspective about their judgment but haven't done anything to hurt anyone. The focus is on their internal conflict, not their actions towards Hayley.\n"
