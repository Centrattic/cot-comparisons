Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation involves Hayley announcing her second pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author is feeling judgmental about the timing of the announcement and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker announced the pregnancy a few weeks in, around four weeks, which is before the 12-week mark that's commonly considered safer to announce to avoid the risk of miscarriage. The author is questioning why they didn't wait, even though they didn't express this judgment directly.\n\nThe key points here are about social etiquette and personal judgment. Common advice is to wait until the first trimester is over because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first 12 weeks. So, the author's thought is based on that general guideline. However, the author didn't act on that judgment or voice it, just thinks about it. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for having that thought. The answer depends on whether having such a thought, without acting on it, is considered wrong. The author was supportive during the announcement and after the miscarriage, so their actions were kind. However, the internal judgment might be seen as unkind, but the user is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have private thoughts that they don't express. The author isn't spreading gossip or criticizing Hayley, so maybe they aren't in the wrong for thinking it. However, it's also important to consider that everyone's circumstances are different. Hayley might have had valid reasons for announcing early, like high risk again, but the author doesn't know that. The author's judgment is based on general etiquette, but without knowing Hayley's situation, it's not necessarily wrong to think that way.\n\nBut since the author didn't act on it and was supportive, the answer might be that they aren't in the wrong. However, the fact that the author is feeling judgmental might indicate they should reflect on their own thoughts. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether they should reflect. Since they didn't express the judgment and were supportive, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that even thinking it is being judgmental, which could make the answer A. But typically, in these kinds of questions, the focus is on actions, not thoughts. So B seems correct.\n"
