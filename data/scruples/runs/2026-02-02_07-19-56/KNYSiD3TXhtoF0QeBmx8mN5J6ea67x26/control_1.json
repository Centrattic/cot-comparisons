Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves their coworker, Hayley, announcing a pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author is questioning if it was wrong for Hayley to announce so soon and if the author is being too judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Hayley announced her pregnancy when she was only 4 weeks along. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until at least three months, which is more common because early miscarriages are common before that. The author didn't say anything to Hayley but feels guilty for thinking it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their thoughts and possible judgment.\n\nThe main factors here are privacy, cultural norms around pregnancy announcements, and the author's internal judgment vs. their actions. The author didn't express their judgment to Hayley and was supportive both during the announcement and after the miscarriage. So, the author didn't act on their judgment or spread negativity. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, there's a common understanding that announcing a pregnancy after the first trimester (around 12 weeks) is often advised to avoid the risk of early miscarriage. However, people choose to announce when they feel comfortable, and it's their personal decision. The author's thoughts are more about questioning Hayley's choice, which is a personal opinion, not an action that harmed anyone. \n\nThe author is concerned about being judgmental, which is valid because everyone has different circumstances. However, having personal thoughts doesn't make someone wrong unless they acted on them in a harmful way. Since the author didn't confront Hayley or spread criticism, their internal thoughts aren't unethical or wrong. The author is reflecting on their own feelings, which is a sign of self-awareness rather than wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author's actions were supportive, and their internal judgment doesn't translate into actual wrongdoing, especially since they didn't express it to Hayley or others.\n"
