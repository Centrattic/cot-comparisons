Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The key points here are the author's internal judgment versus the actual actions taken.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy early, around four weeks. The author is wondering if that's too soon, especially considering her first pregnancy was high risk. The author didn't express these thoughts to Hayley but felt judgmental. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't make any disparaging comments, didn't participate in negative discussions, and even sent a supportive message after the miscarriage. The judgment is internal and not acted upon. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might wait until the first trimester is over (around 12 weeks) to announce a pregnancy, others choose to share earlier. There's no universal rule, so it's a matter of personal choice. The author's concern is valid from an information standpoint (miscarriages are common before 12 weeks), but the author didn't act on that judgment. \n\nThe main issue here is the author's self-perceived judgmental thoughts. Since the author didn't express these thoughts to Hayley or harm her in any way, it's more about the author's feelings rather than an action that wrongs Hayley. The author is reflecting on their own judgment, not making it public. \n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's thoughts alone don't constitute wrongdoing unless they acted on them. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author didn't do anything harmful and was actually supportive.\n"
