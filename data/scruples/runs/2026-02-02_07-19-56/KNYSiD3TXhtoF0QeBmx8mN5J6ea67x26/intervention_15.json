Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy very early, around four weeks along, and later had a miscarriage. The author feels that Hayley should have waited until three months to announce, which is the common etiquette since early miscarriages are more common. The author is questioning their own judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe there's a reason she announced early. Maybe she and her partner wanted to share their joy even with the risk, or they had medical reasons to start tracking early. The author is feeling judgmental but hasn't said anything to Hayley, which is good. They expressed support after the miscarriage, so their actions are supportive even if their thoughts are critical.\n\nThe key points here are intention and impact. The author is reflecting on their own judgment, which is natural, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for having these thoughts. The author isn't acting on those thoughts in a harmful way. They're just thinking about it. In terms of etiquette, while the common advice is to wait until three months, people have different reasons for announcing early. The author's judgment might stem from a place of concern, but it's not necessarily malicious. \n\nIs the author wrong for thinking this? Well, everyone has their own opinions, and having a thought isn't the same as being in the wrong. However, the author is aware that Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe they should consider that Hayley's situation might be different. The author isn't acting on the judgment, so the main issue is their internal thought process. \n\nIn general, people can have differing views without being in the wrong, especially if they're not causing harm. The author's support and actions towards Hayley are positive. The question is whether the judgment itself is wrong. Since they're not expressing it, it's more about self-reflection. The answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, but they might need to check their own biases.\n"
