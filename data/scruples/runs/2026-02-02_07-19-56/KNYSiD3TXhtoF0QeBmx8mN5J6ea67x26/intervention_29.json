Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce a pregnancy. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy very early, around four weeks. The author is wondering if that's too early, given that the first pregnancy was high-risk and that miscarriages are common before three months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't express their judgment directly to Hayley, just thought about it. They supported her after the miscarriage. The key here is whether the author is being judgmental without cause. \n\nPregnancy announcement etiquette can vary, but it's commonly advised to wait until the first trimester is over because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the early stages. However, people choose different times based on their personal comfort and circumstances. Hayley might have had her reasons for announcing early, maybe due to her previous high-risk pregnancy, or maybe she just wanted to share the joy quickly.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty about their thoughts. The question is whether those thoughts make them \"in the wrong.\" Since the author didn't act on those thoughts, didn't spread rumors, and supported Hayley afterward, their internal judgment might not be malicious. However, the fact that they're questioning their own judgment suggests they're aware that it's sensitive.\n\nBut is it wrong to have those thoughts? People often have judgments, especially in situations involving others' private lives. The key is intent and action. The author didn't harm Hayley, so maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the author might feel they should be more empathetic and not judge others' life choices. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's judgment leads to a lack of support or negative feelings, even if unspoken, it could be seen as wrong. But since they did support her, perhaps it's not. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the judgment is harmful. Since the author acted supportively, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the judgment is based on incorrect assumptions (like assuming the announcement time was the problem), then maybe they are. However, the common advice to wait until three months isn't a strict rule. So perhaps the author isn't at fault. \n\nAnswer B.\n"
