Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, which turned out to be a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is reflecting on their own thoughts, not actions. They didn't say anything to Hayley or others. They supported her both times, but they're questioning their judgment about the timing of the announcement. The key here is whether the author's internal thoughts make them in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's common advice to wait until the first trimester is over (around 12 weeks) before announcing a pregnancy because the risk of miscarriage is higher early on. But this is a guideline, not a rule. Hayley might have had her reasons for announcing early\u2014maybe personal preference, family traditions, or other factors. The author is respecting her choice by not voicing their opinion but is struggling with their own judgment.\n\nThe author isn't acting on their judgment, so there's no direct harm done. They\u2019re not spreading gossip or criticizing Hayley. They\u2019re just having internal thoughts. The question is about whether those thoughts make them at fault. Since the author is not causing harm and is actually supportive, their self-doubt is normal but doesn't make them wrong. People often have conflicting thoughts in such situations, especially when sensitive topics like miscarriage are involved.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're not acting on harmful judgments and are being supportive. Their internal thoughts don't translate to wrongdoing here.\n"
