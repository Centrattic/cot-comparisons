Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early\u2014only four weeks along. The office was supportive, but there were some whispers about her getting pregnant again so quickly at her age (early to mid-20s). Later, Hayley had a miscarriage. The author is feeling conflicted because they think maybe Hayley should have waited until three months to announce, as they thought that was proper etiquette, especially since her first pregnancy was high risk. But the author didn't say anything to Hayley and expressed support both times. They're now questioning if they're being too judgmental.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's thoughts on the timing of the announcement, their actions (supporting Hayley), and their internal conflict about their own judgment. \n\nFirst, the author didn't act on their judgment. They congratulated Hayley and supported her after the miscarriage. So, no direct harm done. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking Hayley should have waited. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's common for people to announce pregnancies around the first trimester (12-13 weeks) because the risk of miscarriage drops after that. However, people choose when to announce based on their comfort and circumstances. Hayley might have had her reasons, maybe they wanted to share the joy earlier, or their first pregnancy's high risk made them more cautious, but they still decided to announce early. \n\nThe author is internalizing judgment, which is a natural reaction, but the act of thinking something isn't necessarily being in the wrong. The question is whether the author is wrong for having that thought. \n\nSince the author didn't express their judgment to Hayley or others, and they supported her, their thoughts alone don't make them the \"asshole.\" The AITA subreddit often looks at actions, not just thoughts. So unless the author acted in a harmful way, they aren't in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're struggling with their own judgment but haven't acted on it negatively. The story doesn't indicate any malicious intent or harm done by their thoughts. The author's support and empathy towards Hayley counterbalance the internal judgment.\n"
