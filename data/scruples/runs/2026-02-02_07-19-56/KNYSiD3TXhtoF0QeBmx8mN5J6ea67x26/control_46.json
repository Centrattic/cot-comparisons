Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing a pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author is feeling conflicted because they think the coworker should have waited to announce until three months, which is a common etiquette due to the higher risk of miscarriage in the first trimester.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is being judgmental in a harmful way. The author mentions they didn't participate in negative discussions and supported the coworker both times. So their actions towards Hayley were positive. The internal conflict is about their own thoughts and feelings, not their actions towards others. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's personal judgment versus actual wrongdoing. The question is whether thinking that the coworker should have waited is being in the wrong. Since the author didn't express these thoughts to anyone, criticized no one, and supported Hayley, there's no direct harm caused. \n\nHowever, the author is feeling judgmental. But the question is about whether they are \"in the wrong.\" The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks at whether the person did something wrong, not just if they have negative thoughts. Since the author didn't act on those thoughts and treated Hayley well, their thoughts alone don't make them wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't do anything harmful, just have internal judgments they're reflecting on.\n"
