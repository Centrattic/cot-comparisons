Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker, Hayley, announcing her second pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author feels conflicted because they think Hayley should have waited until three months to announce, given that early miscarriages are common.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is judging Hayley for announcing the pregnancy too early, especially since her first pregnancy was high-risk. The author didn't say anything directly but is questioning their own judgment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this judgment.\n\nFrom an etiquette perspective, traditionally, people wait until the first trimester (around 12-14 weeks) to announce a pregnancy because the risk of miscarriage is lower after that point. However, some people choose to announce earlier for personal reasons. The author's own judgment is based on this traditional etiquette. But are they in the wrong for thinking that?\n\nThe author didn't voice their opinion to Hayley, so no direct harm was done. They expressed support after the miscarriage and didn't participate in negative gossip. The real issue is their internal judgment. The question is whether internal judgment alone makes them the asshole.\n\nIn many cases, holding personal opinions or judgments isn't considered \"in the wrong\" unless those judgments lead to harmful actions. The author isn't spreading rumors or being cruel; they're just having thoughts. However, the fact that they're wondering if they're being too judgmental suggests they're aware their thoughts might be harsh. The key here is whether the judgment is valid or not.\n\nHayley's decision to announce early might have been personal. Maybe they wanted to share the joy early, or perhaps they were confident based on her medical history. The author's assumption that waiting is the proper etiquette is correct in a general sense, but people have different circumstances. The author's judgment is based on a valid concern, but it's possible they're overstepping by judging Hayley's personal choice without knowing her reasons.\n\nBut the author didn't act on their judgment. They supported Hayley and didn't express their thoughts. So, in terms of actual wrongdoing, maybe not. However, the question is about being in the wrong for the judgment itself. If the community's opinion is that internal judgment without action isn't sufficient to make someone the asshole, then the answer would be B (not in the wrong). If the community believes that having such judgment is inherently wrong, then A.\n\nLooking at similar \"AITA\" threads, often people are advised that having personal opinions isn't the issue unless they act on them. The focus is on actions, not thoughts. So the author's inaction and support might mean they're not in the wrong. But some might argue that the judgment is unkind, even if not expressed. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author didn't cause harm through their actions, the answer is likely B.\n"
