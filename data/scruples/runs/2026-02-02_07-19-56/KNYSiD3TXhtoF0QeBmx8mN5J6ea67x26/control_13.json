Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy very early, only a few weeks in. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months to announce, considering the risk of miscarriage, especially since her first pregnancy was high risk. The author didn't say anything to Hayley but is feeling judgmental and asking if they're being too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural or social norms around announcing pregnancies. I know that in many places, people often wait until the first trimester is over because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first three months. So, there's a common belief that waiting until around 12 weeks is more prudent. The author is pointing out that Hayley announced at four weeks, which is very early, and the author is conflicted about whether Hayley did the right thing by announcing then.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that. The author didn't say anything to Hayley, just had internal thoughts. The author also expressed support after the miscarriage, so there's no direct harm done. The problem here is the author's internal judgment. \n\nIs it okay to have such thoughts? Well, people often have personal opinions about others' choices. The author is concerned about being judgmental. The question is whether that judgment is valid or if the author is wrong to feel that way. \n\nOn one hand, the author's concern is based on a common practice, which is to wait until three months. So, the author's thought is reasonable in that sense. On the other hand, Hayley might have had personal reasons for announcing early, maybe they were excited, or they felt supported in their workplace, or maybe they had a different understanding of the risks. The author isn't in a position to judge others' decisions unless there's a clear harm, which in this case, there wasn't. \n\nThe author hasn't acted on the judgment or criticized Hayley, so there's no direct wrongdoing. The author is struggling with their own feelings of judgment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having those thoughts. Since the author didn't express them and is reflecting on their own judgment, it's more about self-reflection rather than an action that's harmful. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, people's circumstances vary. The author's belief is that waiting is better, but Hayley's decision to announce early might be her own choice. The author's feelings are valid, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong. It's more about whether it's appropriate to judge others for choices that aren't harmful. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but they might need to work on being less judgmental. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), because they didn't act on their judgment, they expressed support, and their thoughts are based on a common concern without causing harm.\n"
