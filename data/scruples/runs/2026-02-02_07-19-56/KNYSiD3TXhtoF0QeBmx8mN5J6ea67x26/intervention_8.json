Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. The author didn't say anything to her, just had thoughts and feels.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hayley announced her pregnancy early, around 4 weeks. The author thinks it's improper because of the risk of miscarriage before three months. But Hayley had a miscarriage, which is a tough situation.\n\nThe author was supportive in both instances, so they didn't act on their judgment. The question is about whether thinking the coworker was wrong makes them in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people can have judgments without acting on them. The key here is whether the author's thoughts are harmful. Since they didn't express them and were supportive, maybe they're not in the wrong. But some might argue that even thinking it is judgmental. However, the author is reflecting on their own judgment, which is common. The community might say that unless they acted on it, they're not in the wrong. So, probably answer B.\n"
