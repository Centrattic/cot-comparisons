Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that the coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around 4 weeks along, and then suffered a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking she should have waited until three months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't say anything negative to Hayley, just had internal thoughts. They were supportive both times. The main issue here is the author's internal judgment about the timing of the announcement. \n\nNow, the key points are about social etiquette regarding announcing pregnancies. The author's belief is that waiting until three months is proper because of the risk of miscarriage, especially considering Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk. But is that belief accurate? In many cultures, people announce pregnancies once they're a bit further along, maybe after the first trimester risk, which is around 12-13 weeks. However, some people choose to announce earlier, sometimes as soon as they find out, even if it's just a few weeks. \n\nThe author's judgment comes from a place of concern, not malice. They didn't express their thoughts to Hayley, which is important. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. The answer likely hinges on whether the judgment is valid or if it's a common, understandable thought.\n\nConsidering that the author is questioning their own judgment and feeling guilty about it, it suggests they're self-aware. The author isn't spreading rumors or being cruel; they're just reflecting on their feelings. Also, Hayley had a history of a high-risk first pregnancy, which might make the author more sensitive to the risks. However, Hayley and her husband might have chosen to share earlier for personal reasons, maybe wanting to celebrate or seek support early.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't acting on their judgment, which is crucial. The T in AITA (Am I the Asshole) often depends on whether the person did something harmful. Since the author did nothing but think, they aren't directly wrong. People have different opinions on when to announce, and while the author's belief is based on common advice, others might have different practices. The author's feelings are valid, but they aren't in the wrong for having them, especially since they didn't express them negatively.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's thoughts are a personal judgment, not an action that harms others, and they're reflecting on their own feelings without acting on them.\n"
