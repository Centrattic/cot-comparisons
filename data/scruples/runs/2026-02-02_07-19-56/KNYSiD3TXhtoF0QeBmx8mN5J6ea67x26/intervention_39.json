Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if it was wrong of them to think the coworker should have waited until three months to announce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy after being about four weeks along. The author knows that miscarriages are common in the first trimester and thought it was proper etiquette to wait until three months. The author didn't say anything to Hayley but feels judgmental. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts.\n\nSo, the main issue is about the appropriateness of announcing a pregnancy early and the author's judgment. Let's break it down. First, from a medical standpoint, early miscarriages are indeed common, especially in the first trimester. So, maybe there's some validity to the author's concern that announcing too early could lead to more emotional stress if there's a loss. However, each person's situation is different. Hayley had already gone through a high-risk first pregnancy. Maybe she and her husband were more confident this time, or they had medical reasons to announce earlier. They might have felt supported by their workplace and wanted to share their joy.\n\nThe author didn't express their judgment outwardly. They sent a supportive message and felt genuine emotions. So, the author isn't acting on their judgment, just thinking it. The question is whether having these thoughts makes them wrong. The author is self-aware, recognizing their judgment and wondering if they're overstepping.\n\nNow, considering social etiquette, there's no universal rule on when to announce a pregnancy. Some people do it as soon as they find out, others wait. The author might have been taught that three months is the norm, but others don't follow that. It's possible Hayley's decision was based on her own comfort and circumstances. The author's judgment is internal, not harmful in action. They're not spreading gossip or criticizing Hayley publicly. \n\nBut the author is feeling guilty for their judgment. They're questioning if they're being too critical. The key here is whether the judgment is justified. If the author's only fault is thinking something that isn't necessarily wrong, then maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a common human experience to have judgments, especially without full context of Hayley's situation. The author isn't causing harm, just experiencing internal conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're not acting on their judgment, and their thoughts, while critical, don't translate into harmful actions. The main issue is their self-perception and whether they should feel guilty for having those thoughts. The answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for having these thoughts as long as they're not acting on them in a harmful way.\n"
