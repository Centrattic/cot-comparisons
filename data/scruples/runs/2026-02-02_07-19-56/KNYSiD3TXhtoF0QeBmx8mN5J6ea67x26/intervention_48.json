Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, only to suffer a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited to announce until three months, but the author hasn't said anything to her. The author is conflicted about their judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main question is whether the author is wrong for thinking Hayley should have waited. The author didn't express their thoughts to Hayley and was supportive both times. The core issue is about judgment and etiquette regarding announcing pregnancies, especially given the risk of early miscarriage.\n\nI know that in many cultural contexts, it's common to wait until the first trimester is over, around 12 weeks, to announce a pregnancy to reduce the emotional impact of a potential miscarriage. However, people's decisions on when to announce are personal and can depend on various factors. Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe they wanted to be cautious this time, but they chose to announce early for their own reasons. \n\nThe author is experiencing internal conflict and self-doubt about their judgment. They didn't act on their thoughts, which is important. They didn't spread any negative comments or make Hayley feel bad. The author's guilt comes from their own feelings of judgment, not from any action they took against Hayley. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, being in the wrong usually involves actions that hurt others or violate social norms. Here, the author hasn't done anything harmful. They're struggling with their own thoughts, which is common. The key is whether the author's judgment is valid or if they're being too harsh. \n\nSince the author didn't act on their judgment and was supportive, they are not in the wrong. The question is about their internal thoughts, not actions. It's normal to have thoughts, but the author isn't acting on them. The real issue is the author's self-judgment about their own feelings, not Hayley's decision. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
