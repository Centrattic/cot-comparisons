Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, Hayley, the coworker, announced her second pregnancy when she was about four weeks along. The author is wondering if it's wrong that Hayley announced so early, especially since her first pregnancy was high risk. The author didn't say anything to Hayley but feels judgmental. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having those thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette around announcing pregnancies. I remember that traditionally, people wait until the first trimester is over, around 12-14 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first few weeks. So, announcing early might be seen as inconsiderate due to that risk. But is the author's judgmental thought making them at fault?\n\nThe author didn't voice their judgment publicly or to Hayley. They even sent a supportive message after the miscarriage. They felt bad about the judgmental thoughts but didn't act on them. The key point is whether thinking something makes you at fault. The author's intention was to be supportive, and they didn't harm Hayley directly. However, the author is questioning their own judgment.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they might be overthinking because they are aware that their judgment could come off as unsupportive. But since they didn't express it and showed support, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the act of judging someone else's personal decisions could be seen as insensitive, even if unspoken. The author might need to reflect on why they feel this way. Maybe there's an underlying assumption about what Hayley should have done, which might not be fair.\n\nAnother angle is that Hayley had personal reasons for announcing early. The author doesn't know if Hayley consulted her doctor or had other considerations. The first pregnancy being high risk might have influenced her decision, but the author is assuming she didn't follow proper etiquette. People have different situations, and the author's judgment is based on their own standards without knowing the full story.\n\nBut the author didn't act on their judgment, which is a positive point. They felt conflicted and sought advice, showing self-awareness. So, while the thoughts themselves aren't harmful, the fact that the author is judging someone else's personal choices might make them question their own attitude. However, unless the author expressed those thoughts, are they truly at fault?\n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" framework, it's about whether the author's actions or thoughts are inconsiderate or wrong. Since the author didn't act unkindly and supported Hayley after the miscarriage, their internal thoughts alone might not make them at fault. But the judgmental thinking could still be seen as problematic, even if unspoken.\n\nI think the key here is that internal thoughts aren't actions, but they can reflect a person's mindset. However, without causing harm through words or actions, the author isn't directly at fault. They might need to work on their own feelings of judgment, but in terms of the situation as described, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they didn't act on their judgment and were supportive overall.\n"
