Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around 4 weeks along. She had a miscarriage. The author is questioning why Hayley didn't wait until 3 months, which is a common time for announcing pregnancies to avoid early miscarriage news. The author feels judgmental but hasn't said anything directly to Hayley. They want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe author's main point is about the timing of the announcement. They're wondering if Hayley was too hasty. The question is whether the author is being judgmental without cause.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. I know that many people wait until the first trimester (3 months) because that's when the risk of miscarriage drops significantly. But it's not a strict rule. Some people announce earlier, maybe due to personal reasons, cultural differences, or their own circumstances.\n\nThe author is not criticizing Hayley directly; they just have thoughts. They even mention they didn't participate in the whispered discussions and were supportive. The key here is that the author is reflecting on their own judgment. The question is whether their judgment is unfair.\n\nSince the author hasn't acted on their judgment or harmed Hayley, it's more about their internal feelings. Being judgmental is common, but does that make them \"in the wrong\"? Well, if they are not expressing harmful opinions and are still supportive, maybe not. The author is self-aware and recognizes their judgment, which is a good sign.\n\nHowever, the act of questioning Hayley's decision without knowing her full circumstances could be seen as assuming the worst. Maybe Hayley had reasons for announcing early that aren't considered here. The author doesn't know if her second pregnancy was high-risk too, though the prompt says the first was. Maybe they wanted to share the joy early or had other personal reasons.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, while 3 months is common, it's not a hard rule. So the author's judgment is based on a guideline that isn't absolute. Therefore, the author's feelings are valid, but their judgment might be misplaced without more context.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for having these thoughts, but they should be careful not to let judgment affect their actions. Since they haven't acted on it, the answer would be B\u2014they are not in the wrong. They're struggling with their own feelings but aren't actively harmful.\n"
