Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking the coworker should have waited.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy when she was only 4 weeks along. The author is conflicted because they know that early pregnancies are more at risk, and the first pregnancy was high risk. The author felt that maybe Hayley should have waited until the third month to announce, which is a common etiquette. But the author didn't say anything to Hayley and expressed support when they found out about the miscarriage.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't directly criticizing Hayley, just thinking about their judgment. The main issue here is the internal conflict of the author feeling judgmental. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common advice to wait until the first trimester is over (around 12-13 weeks) to announce a pregnancy because the risk of miscarriage is lower after that point. However, people sometimes announce earlier for various reasons\u2014personal choices, cultural differences, or just being excited. The fact that Hayley had a high-risk first pregnancy might make others worry more, but it's not up to the author to judge her decision unless there's harm done.\n\nThe author didn't act on their judgment, didn't criticize Hayley, and supported her when the miscarriage happened. The problem here is the author's internal judgment rather than any harmful action. In AITA scenarios, the focus is usually on whether the person did something wrong or acted inconsiderately. Since the author didn't do anything to Hayley, their thoughts alone don't make them the asshole. People can have private thoughts without being in the wrong, especially if they don't act on them or express them in a harmful way.\n\nAdditionally, the author's judgment is based on valid concerns about pregnancy risks, which might be a common perspective. However, each couple makes their own decision about when to announce. The author's feelings of being judgmental might come from a place of caring, but that doesn't mean they're wrong for having that thought. The key is that they didn't act on it or cause any harm, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
