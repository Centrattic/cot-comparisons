Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks along. The author is wondering if it was wrong of Hayley to announce so early, especially since her first pregnancy was high risk. Then Hayley had a miscarriage, and the author is feeling conflicted about their own judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they were happy for Hayley when the pregnancy was announced and supportive after the miscarriage. They didn't participate in negative discussions. The main issue here is the author's internal judgment about the timing of the announcement. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people do announce pregnancies early, while others wait until the first trimester is over because of the higher risk of miscarriage in the first three months. So, the author's thought is that maybe Hayley should have waited. But is the author in the wrong for thinking that?\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't express their judgment to Hayley, they were supportive, and they feel bad about their own thoughts. The question is whether the author is being judgmental without cause. \n\nHayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe they were eager to share the news again, or maybe they didn't realize the risk. The author's judgment is based on etiquette, but it's possible that Hayley had her reasons. The author's own actions (supporting, not spreading rumors) suggest they're not being mean. However, the author might be overthinking. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for having these thoughts? Probably not, since they didn't act on them. People can have opinions without being in the wrong if they don't harm others. The real issue is if the author had judged Hayley publicly or acted unkindly, which they didn't. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a reason the author's thoughts are wrong. Maybe the author's judgment is misplaced because it's not their place to say when someone should announce a pregnancy. So, the author isn't in the wrong for thinking it, but they might need to reflect on why they feel that way. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
