Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that the coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy very early, around four weeks, and later had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months, which is common etiquette since early miscarriages are common. The author didn't voice their opinion and was supportive, but feels judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about judgment and empathy. The author is thinking that Hayley made a mistake by announcing too early, but the author didn't actually say anything. The question is whether the author is wrong for having that thought.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's common to wait until the first trimester is over (around 12 weeks) because the risk of miscarriage is higher before that. The author knows this and is thinking Hayley should have followed that advice. However, Hayley's personal circumstances might be different. She might have wanted to share the news early, maybe due to her previous high-risk pregnancy, or other personal reasons. \n\nThe author's intention wasn't to harm Hayley; they were supportive and sent messages. The problem here is internal judgment. The author is feeling guilty for thinking Hayley acted inconsiderately. But is the author in the wrong? The author didn't act on their judgment, didn't spread negativity, and was supportive. \n\nHowever, the author is questioning their own judgment. The answer might depend on whether it's wrong to judge others for their personal choices, even if they follow common etiquette. Since the author didn't act on the judgment, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But maybe the thought itself is wrong because it's being judgmental without knowing Hayley's reasons.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. In such scenarios, people often feel guilty for having negative thoughts. The answer usually leans towards the person not being in the wrong if they didn't act on the judgment and were supportive. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, as long as they don't express it and support the coworker.\n"
