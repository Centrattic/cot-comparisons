Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is about a coworker, Hayley, announcing her second pregnancy early. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months along, as they thought that's the etiquette, especially since Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk. But the author didn't say anything to Hayley directly, just felt judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author isn't Hayley; they're an observer. The author felt that announcing before three months is improper because of the risk of early miscarriage. But Hayley did announce when she was four weeks pregnant, and then suffered a miscarriage. The author is now questioning their judgment.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault for thinking this. Well, the author didn't say anything negative to Hayley. They were supportive both times. The author's judgment is internal, not expressed. So, is it wrong to have such thoughts, even if they aren't shared?\n\nIn terms of etiquette, maybe there's a cultural norm to wait three months. But people have different practices. Some might announce earlier, especially if they're confident or excited. The author's concern is valid because early pregnancy is more vulnerable. But the author isn't doing anything to Hayley except thinking, which is natural, I guess. However, the author is worried about being judgmental. \n\nIs the author wrong for having those thoughts? Well, everyone has thoughts they might later regret or think are judgmental. The key here is that the author didn't act on those thoughts. They didn't criticize Hayley, didn't spread rumors, supported her both times. The author is self-aware enough to recognize their judgmental nature and is seeking reassurance.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for having those thoughts. People can have opinions about what's appropriate, but unless they're acting on them in a harmful way, it's not their fault. The author's actions (being supportive) are what matter, not the internal thoughts. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
