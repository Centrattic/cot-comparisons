Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to summarize the situation. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around 4 weeks. The author is wondering if it was wrong to announce so early, especially since her first pregnancy was high-risk. After a miscarriage, the author feels guilty for their thoughts but didn't express them.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's judgment about the timing of the announcement, their internal conflict, and whether that makes them the \"asshole.\" \n\nI should consider social norms. Typically, people wait until the first trimester (around 12 weeks) to announce a pregnancy because the risk of miscarriage is higher before that. The author's thought is based on this etiquette. However, Hayley might have her reasons for announcing early\u2014maybe they're excited, wanted support, or had a previous high-risk pregnancy and were more cautious this time. But in this case, the first was high-risk, but the second was announced early. \n\nThe author didn't voice their judgment, only thought about it. They also supported Hayley after the miscarriage. The question is about being judgmental. Is it wrong to have that thought? People often have private thoughts, but the issue is whether the author overstepped by having that judgment. \n\nAlso, the coworker group is close-knit, so Hayley might feel comfortable sharing early. The author's main conflict is self-judgment about being too critical. \n\nThe answer would hinge on whether the author's thoughts are unreasonable. Since the author didn't act on them, it's more about their internal feelings. The community might say that while it's common to wait, the author isn't in the wrong for having that thought, as they didn't harm anyone. However, others might say the author is being judgmental without knowing Hayley's circumstances. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since they didn't express the judgment and were supportive, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author isn't acting on the judgment, just having it. People can have opinions as long as they don't act on them in a harmful way. The key is that the author didn't say anything hurtful and supported Hayley when needed. So the answer is B.\n"
