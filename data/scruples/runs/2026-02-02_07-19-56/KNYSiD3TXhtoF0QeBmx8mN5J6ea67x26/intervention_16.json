Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. The situation involves Hayley announcing her second pregnancy very early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author feels judgmental about Hayley's decision to announce so soon, especially since her first pregnancy was high risk. They didn't say anything to Hayley directly but are questioning their own thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around pregnancy announcements. I remember that some people do wait until the first trimester is over because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the early weeks. But others announce earlier, maybe because they're excited or it's culturally accepted. The key here is that the author is reflecting on their judgment without expressing it. \n\nThe author says they were genuinely happy for Hayley and offered support after the miscarriage. They didn't participate in the negative discussions others had. Their internal conflict is about whether their judgment is justified. The question is if they're in the wrong for having these thoughts even if they didn't act on them.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's judgment is valid or if they're overstepping. Since the coworker chose to announce early, maybe for personal reasons, the author isn't in the position to judge. The author's intentions were good\u2014they supported Hayley\u2014but the internal judgment could be seen as too harsh. However, since they didn't voice their opinion or act unkindly, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the fact that they're so focused on their judgment might indicate they are being judgmental. \n\nIn similar situations, people often advise not to judge others' life choices unless it directly affects you. Here, the author's judgment is internal, not affecting Hayley. So perhaps they aren't in the wrong, but should work on not being judgmental. Alternatively, if the question is about whether their thoughts are wrong, then maybe they are, but the action (not acting on it) makes them not at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author didn't act on their judgment and supported Hayley. But maybe A is correct if internal judgment is considered wrong. However, in most cases, people can have private thoughts without being in the wrong unless they harm others. So B makes sense here.\n"
