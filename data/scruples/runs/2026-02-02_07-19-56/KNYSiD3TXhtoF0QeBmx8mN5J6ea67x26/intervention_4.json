Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that the coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, which turned into a miscarriage. The author feels that announcing before the third month is improper because miscarriages are common then, and now they're questioning why Hayley didn't wait.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette around pregnancy announcements. The author mentions that they thought the proper thing was to wait until three months, which is common advice to reduce the risk of having to share news of a miscarriage. However, the key here is that the author is having internal thoughts and feelings of judgment but hasn't acted on them or expressed them to Hayley. They even sent a supportive message after the miscarriage, so their actions were kind.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for these internal thoughts. The author isn't spreading gossip or directly criticizing Hayley. They're just reflecting on the situation, which is a natural human reaction. However, the author is concerned about being judgmental. The main issue is whether internal thoughts, as long as they aren't expressed, make someone \"in the wrong.\"\n\nIn many cases, people are allowed to have personal opinions or thoughts without being wrong, especially if they don't act on them. The author isn't causing harm here. The real question is about the appropriateness of announcing early. But since the author didn't voice their judgment and supported Hayley, their internal thoughts alone might not make them in the wrong. However, some might argue that even thinking judgmentally is problematic, but generally, people aren't held accountable for their private thoughts unless they act on them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they didn't express their judgment and acted supportively. The internal thoughts, while critical, don't translate into wrongdoing if there's no harmful action.\n"
