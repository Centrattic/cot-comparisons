Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early on, and then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Hayley announced her pregnancy when she was about four weeks along. The author mentions a common etiquette of waiting until the first trimester to announce, which makes sense because the risk of miscarriage is higher early on. But Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe she and her husband felt more urgency or were more cautious this time? Or maybe they just wanted to share their joy early.\n\nThe author didn't voice their judgment to Hayley, but is feeling guilty about their thoughts. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for having those thoughts. The question is about judgmental thinking, not about actions. The author didn't say anything to Hayley, so their actions are okay. The internal thoughts are another matter.\n\nBut is it really the author's fault for thinking this? People can have thoughts without being wrong. However, the author is self-aware enough to recognize that they might be too judgmental. The issue is whether the author's thoughts are justified or if they're overstepping.\n\nHayley's personal situation matters. The author mentions that her first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe the couple wanted to be more proactive this time. Or perhaps they didn't know the common etiquette. The author's judgment is based on a general guideline, but every individual's circumstances are different. The author isn't directly affecting Hayley, so their thoughts are personal. The fact that they felt bad after the miscarriage and supported Hayley shows they care, but the internal thoughts aren't harmful. So, the author isn't in the wrong for having those thoughts, just maybe in the wrong for being judgmental, but since they didn't act on it, it's not their fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
