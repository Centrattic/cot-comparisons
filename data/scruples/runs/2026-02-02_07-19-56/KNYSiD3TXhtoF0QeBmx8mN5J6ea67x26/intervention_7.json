Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Hayley announced her second pregnancy early, but then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months to announce, as that's common etiquette. The author feels judgmental but isn't expressing that to Hayley.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider why. The author's main point is about etiquette\u2014miscarriages are common before three months. But is it the author's place to judge? The author isn't saying anything negative to Hayley and is supportive. But the author is feeling judgmental, which might be an issue.\n\nIs it wrong to think that? Well, the author isn't acting on those thoughts. They didn't voice their opinion, so no direct harm. But internal judgment can still be problematic if it affects how they treat the coworker. However, the author did support Hayley both times. \n\nOn the other hand, people have different practices. Maybe Hayley had her reasons for announcing early. The author's thought process is about etiquette, but everyone's circumstances differ. The author isn't in a position to dictate Hayley's choices. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author isn't acting on their thoughts, so maybe not in the wrong in terms of actions. However, the internal judgment might be something they should reflect on. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author hasn't caused any harm, perhaps they're not at fault. \n\nBut the user says they think the author is in the wrong. Maybe because the author is being judgmental, even if not vocalizing it. However, the author is self-aware and feels they're being too judgmental. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because they're not acting on it and are supportive. \n\nAlternatively, the author's thoughts could be seen as assuming Hayley should follow a specific etiquette without considering her choices. So maybe the author is overstepping in their own mind. But again, since they aren't expressing it, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is experiencing internal conflict but isn't harming anyone. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but they should work on their judgment. Alternatively, A if internal judgment counts. But in these AITA questions, usually, you're in the wrong if you acted on it. Since the author didn't, it's B.\n"
