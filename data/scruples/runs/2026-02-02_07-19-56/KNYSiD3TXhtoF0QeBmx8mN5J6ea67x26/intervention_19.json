Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy early, and later had a miscarriage. The author is feeling judgmental about her decision to announce early, especially given that her first pregnancy was high-risk. The author didn't say anything to Hayley but is conflicted about their own feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole). The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable in their judgment. The author admits they didn't participate in any negative discussions and supported Hayley when they could. Their own judgment is internal, not expressed. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. The main points to consider: \n\n1. **Privacy and Etiquette**: It's common for people to announce pregnancies at different times. Some wait until the first trimester to reduce the risk of announcing and then facing a miscarriage. However, others choose to share earlier for personal reasons. The author's belief that three months is the proper etiquette is a common view, but not a universal rule. \n\n2. **Judgment vs. Action**: The author hasn't acted on their judgment. They haven't criticized Hayley or spread their opinion. Their judgment is internal. The key here is whether internal thoughts make someone \"in the wrong.\" Typically, AITA cases consider actions, not just thoughts. If the author didn't express their judgment, it's hard to hold them accountable.\n\n3. **Empathy and Understanding**: The author did support Hayley after the miscarriage. They felt bad for Hayley and reached out. This shows they aren't malicious. However, the fact that they kept thinking about the announcement timing might indicate some level of judgment. But again, without action, it's more about personal feelings.\n\n4. **Social Norms vs. Individual Choices**: While there are general norms about pregnancy announcements, people's circumstances vary. Hayley's decision might have been based on her and her husband's comfort, her previous high-risk pregnancy, or other factors. The author's assumption that it's wrong might not consider Hayley's reasons.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were harmful. Since the author didn't act on their judgment and even supported Hayley, the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong. However, if the focus is on judgmental thoughts, some might argue that being judgmental is still negative. But in this context, without actions, it's more about personal reflection rather than wrongdoing. \n\nSo, considering that the author didn't act on their thoughts and provided support, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). The internal judgment alone isn't sufficient to make them the asshole.\n"
