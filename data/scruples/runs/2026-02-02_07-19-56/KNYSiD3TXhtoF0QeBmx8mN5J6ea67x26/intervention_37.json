Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker, Hayley, who announced her second pregnancy early, and then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking Hayley should have waited until three months to announce the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The key points are that Hayley announced her pregnancy when she was only four weeks along, which is before the typical three-month mark that the author refers to as proper etiquette. The author is conflicted because they feel Hayley's announcement might have been premature, especially considering her first pregnancy was high risk. However, the author supported Hayley both during the announcement and after the miscarriage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for having this thought. The author isn't acting on the judgment\u2014they aren't saying anything to Hayley, and they were supportive. Their internal conflict is about self-judgment, not Hayley's actions directly. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, there's a common understanding that waiting until the first trimester is over (around 12 weeks) to announce a pregnancy is to minimize the risk of sharing the news if there's a miscarriage. But this is a cultural norm, not a rule. People have different reasons for announcing early. Hayley might have had personal reasons, or maybe her first pregnancy's high risk made her want to share earlier, or perhaps she's not aware of the common etiquette. \n\nThe author isn't being mean or judgmental in action. They're having internal thoughts but aren't harming Hayley. The problem here is the author's self-perceived judgment, but the question is about if they're in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the person is in the wrong for thinking this, not for acting on it. \n\nSince the author is reflecting on their own judgment and seeking advice on whether they're being too harsh, the key is whether their thoughts are valid. The author's concern is valid in terms of common etiquette, but Hayley's reasons for announcing early are her own. The author isn't wrong for having the thought because it's a personal opinion, but they might be overthinking if they're not acting on it. However, the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nIf the author isn't acting on the judgment, they aren't in the wrong for having the thought. People have different perspectives, and as long as they're not vocalizing or acting on their judgment, it's more about personal reflection than being in the wrong. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
