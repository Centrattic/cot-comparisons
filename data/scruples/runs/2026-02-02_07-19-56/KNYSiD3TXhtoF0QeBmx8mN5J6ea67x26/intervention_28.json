Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that Hayley announced her second pregnancy early, around 4 weeks along, and then had a miscarriage. The author feels conflicted because they were happy for her initially but now wonder if announcing so early was inconsiderate, especially since her first pregnancy was high risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around announcing pregnancies. I know that in many circles, people wait until the first trimester (around 12 weeks) because the risk of miscarriage is higher before that. The author mentions this as a common understanding. However, Hayley announced much earlier. \n\nBut the key here is the author's feelings of judgment. They didn't express any negative feelings to Hayley and supported her both times. They're struggling with whether their thoughts make them a bad person. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate. I need to evaluate if judgmental thoughts, especially unspoken ones, make someone in the wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't act on their judgment. They supported Hayley and didn't express any of their doubts. People have different opinions on when to announce, and while the author's belief in waiting is valid, it's important to note that others might choose to share earlier for personal reasons. The author's internal conflict doesn't equate to wrongdoing as long as their actions (like supporting Hayley) were appropriate. \n\nAlso, the coworker's first pregnancy was high risk, but the author doesn't know if that influenced the decision to announce early this time. Maybe Hayley felt more confident this time. The author's judgment is based on their own understanding, but that doesn't make them wrong for having those thoughts, just for not recognizing that others might have different choices.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
