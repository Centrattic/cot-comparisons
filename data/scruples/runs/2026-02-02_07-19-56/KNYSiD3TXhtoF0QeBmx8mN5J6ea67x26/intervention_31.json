Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that the coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks along, and later had a miscarriage. The author feels that maybe she should have waited until three months, considering the high risk in early pregnancy, and is now wondering if they're being too judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around pregnancy announcements. I know that in many places, people wait until the first trimester is over, around 12 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher before that. So the author's thought is based on common advice. However, the coworker might have her own reasons for announcing early\u2014maybe they wanted to share the joy, or they have medical reasons that made them feel comfortable announcing earlier. \n\nThe key here is that the author is reflecting on their own judgment. They didn't express any negative comments to Hayley or others, just had internal thoughts. The question is whether those thoughts make them at fault. The author is not directly harming Hayley; they're just having a thought. But the feeling of judgment might stem from not understanding Hayley's situation. Maybe Hayley's first pregnancy wasn't high risk, but the author assumes it was, or maybe they wanted to celebrate early as a family choice.\n\nThe author is asking if being judgmental in thought is wrong. Since they didn't act on it or spread rumors, their internal thoughts are their own. However, the fact that they're feeling this way might indicate a need to be more empathetic. Everyone's experience is different, and what's considered proper etiquette isn't a one-size-fits-all. The author could be overgeneralizing based on their own understanding without knowing Hayley's personal circumstances.\n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about intent and action. Since they didn't voice their judgment or cause any harm, maybe they're not in the wrong. But there's a lesson in not being quick to judge others' life choices. However, in the context of the question, the answer hinges on whether their thoughts are grounds for being \"in the wrong.\" Since they were supportive and didn't act on the judgment, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, if the community sees internal judgment as a problem even without action, it could be A. But typically, thoughts alone aren't considered wrong unless they lead to harmful actions. Therefore, the answer is likely B.\n"
