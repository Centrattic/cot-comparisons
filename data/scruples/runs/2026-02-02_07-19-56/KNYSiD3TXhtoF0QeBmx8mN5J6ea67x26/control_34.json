Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy very early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author feels she should have waited until three months along, as that's when the risk is lower. The author supported her both times but can't help feeling judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hayley announced the pregnancy early, and the author's judgment is based on common etiquette about announcing pregnancies after the first trimester because of the higher miscarriage risk. The author isn't saying it out loud, so there's no direct harm. But does the author's internal judgment make them at fault?\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't express their judgment, they were supportive, and they feel conflicted. The question is whether their internal thoughts are wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, unless the author acted on their judgment or caused harm, their thoughts themselves aren't wrong. People often have conflicting feelings when others suffer, especially when there's a perceived risk. The author is struggling with their own feelings of judgment, which is a common human experience. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if their judgment is based on assumptions about Hayley's circumstances. For example, maybe Hayley's first pregnancy wasn't high risk, or there were other reasons they chose to announce early. The author's assumption that the first pregnancy was high risk might not be accurate. But the author mentions that Hayley's first was high risk, so maybe they have that information.\n\nBut even if the author's reasoning is based on valid information, the mere fact that they feel judgmental isn't a sign they're in the wrong. People have different opinions on when to announce pregnancies. What matters is whether the author acted on those feelings. Since they didn't and instead offered support, their internal judgment alone isn't making them at fault. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
