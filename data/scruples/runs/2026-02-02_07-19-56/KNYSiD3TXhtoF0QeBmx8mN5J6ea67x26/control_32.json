Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce a pregnancy until three months along. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks, and then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if their judgmental thoughts about the timing make them the \"antagonist in the tale.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk, so maybe they were eager to share the news again. The author didn't say anything negative to Hayley but is feeling conflicted about their own thoughts. The key points here are the cultural or social norms around announcing pregnancies and whether the author's judgment is valid.\n\nIn many societies, the common advice is to wait until the first trimester (around 12 weeks) because the risk of miscarriage is higher during the first three months. The author seems to follow that advice, which makes sense. However, people's personal circumstances vary. Hayley might have had reasons to share the news earlier, such as wanting to celebrate with supportive friends and colleagues, especially since her first pregnancy was high risk and maybe they wanted to share the joy once they felt stable.\n\nThe author didn't act on their judgment or express it to Hayley, which is important. They expressed support both when the pregnancy was announced and after the miscarriage. The question is whether the author's internal thoughts make them wrong. Judging someone's personal choices, even if based on good intentions, can be harsh. Everyone's situation is different, and the author's concern is about etiquette, not about Hayley's actual actions causing harm.\n\nSince the author didn't express their judgment and was supportive, their feelings of being judgmental don't necessarily make them \"in the wrong.\" It's more about recognizing that people have different circumstances and choices. The answer here would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't act on their judgment and their thoughts are based on common advice, but they're struggling with their own feelings of being too judgmental. The key is that they didn't harm Hayley, and their internal conflict is normal, but they aren't the antagonist here.\n"
