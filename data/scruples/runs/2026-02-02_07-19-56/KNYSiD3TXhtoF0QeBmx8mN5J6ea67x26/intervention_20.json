Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker, Hayley, who announced her pregnancy early, only to have a miscarriage later. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking Hayley should have waited until three months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't say anything negative to Hayley or others. They were supportive both times. The judgment is internal, not expressed. The question is whether that internal judgment makes them in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethics perspective, it's important to note that the author isn't acting on their judgment. They're just having thoughts. Everyone has judgments sometimes, but the key is whether the judgment is harmful. Since they didn't express it, maybe it's not their fault. However, the author is reflecting on their own judgment, which is a valid concern for self-awareness.\n\nBut societal norms often suggest waiting until the first trimester to announce a pregnancy because of the risk of miscarriage. Hayley announced early, which the author thinks was a mistake. However, Hayley's personal circumstances\u2014like having a high-risk first pregnancy\u2014might influence her decision. Maybe she wanted to share the joy sooner or had different medical advice.\n\nThe author's judgment is based on etiquette, which is subjective. Different people have different experiences. The author isn't causing harm by thinking this, but they're questioning their own feelings. In terms of \"AITA,\" the community usually considers if the person did something overtly wrong. Since the author didn't act on their judgment, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the judgment is rooted in a lack of empathy or misunderstanding, that's another angle.\n\nIt's also possible that the author's judgment stems from a place of concern, not malice. They genuinely wanted to support Hayley. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't acting on their thoughts and is actually supportive. The internal judgment is common but doesn't equate to being wrong. However, if the judgment is due to not considering Hayley's personal circumstances, maybe there's a case for A. But given that they didn't express it, I think B is more appropriate.\n"
