Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks in. She had a high-risk first pregnancy. The author is wondering if it was wrong for Hayley to announce so early, given that miscarriages are common before three months. But the author didn't say anything to Hayley and expressed support after the miscarriage.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author isn't directly criticizing Hayley; they just have personal thoughts. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for having those thoughts. \n\nThe key points here are judgment and intent. The author is reflecting on their own judgment but hasn't acted on it. They did support Hayley, so their actions were kind. The question is whether having those thoughts makes them in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, there isn't a strict rule about when to announce a pregnancy, though three months is common. However, people have different preferences. The author's judgment is based on their understanding of proper etiquette, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong for thinking it. The author isn't spreading gossip or hurting Hayley, so they aren't acting wrongly. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's internal thoughts are considered \"wrong.\" Since they didn't act on them and supported Hayley, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But maybe some would argue that even thinking it is being judgmental. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually involves actions, not thoughts. The author's actions were appropriate, so they aren't in the wrong for their thoughts alone.\n"
