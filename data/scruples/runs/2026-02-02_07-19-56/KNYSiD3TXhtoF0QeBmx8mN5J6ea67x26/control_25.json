Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The author didn't say anything to Hayley, just had internal thoughts about the timing of the announcement.\n\nFirst, the author was happy for Hayley initially and sent support after the miscarriage. They didn't participate in any negative discussions. Their main concern is about the timing of the announcement\u2014only a few weeks pregnant. They think maybe waiting until three months is better because of the higher risk of miscarriage before that.\n\nNow, considering the situation: people often choose to announce when they feel comfortable, which varies. The author's judgment is internal, not expressed. There's no evidence that the author's thoughts caused harm. The coworker's decision to announce early might be personal, maybe due to excitement or their own circumstances.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's thoughts are wrong. Since they didn't act on them or share them, it's more about their internal feelings. People can have mixed emotions when others face hardships, but the author is reflecting on their own judgment. The question is if they're in the wrong for those thoughts.\n\nSociety often has unspoken rules about pregnancy announcements, but it's a personal choice. The author's intention isn't malicious; they're struggling with their own judgment. They didn't harm anyone by not speaking their thoughts. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't act on their judgment and it's a common personal reflection without causing direct harm.\n"
