He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. The situation is that the author is the sole income earner, working long hours, and the boyfriend doesn't have a job. The author feels resentful because they have financial responsibilities and debt to pay off.\n\nFirst, the author is responsible for all the household income, which is a big deal. They mention working 10+ hour shifts, so there's a lot of pressure there. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is causing strain. The author has been saving money, which is understandable given their financial situation. \n\nThe boyfriend is asking for expensive gifts, but the author feels they can't afford it. The key point here is the financial responsibility. The author is trying to manage their money wisely, even though they do buy smaller gifts. The $2000 request is a significant expense, and the author is struggling with whether they can or should spend that. \n\nThe author also mentions that for their own birthday, they got books and socks, which they had mentioned. That shows the boyfriend isn't great at remembering or prioritizing their partner's wishes, which might indicate an imbalance in the relationship. The author's resentment is about the financial burden and the lack of reciprocity. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and the author has valid reasons for not being able to spend that much. The author isn't refusing to give any gift, just the expensive one. The boyfriend's lack of financial contribution is a major issue here. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners contribute, especially financially. If one partner isn't contributing and is asking for expensive gifts, that can create a lot of stress. The author is trying to set boundaries to manage their finances and reduce resentment. The answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid financial constraints and the boyfriend's situation isn't helping the relationship's balance.\n"
