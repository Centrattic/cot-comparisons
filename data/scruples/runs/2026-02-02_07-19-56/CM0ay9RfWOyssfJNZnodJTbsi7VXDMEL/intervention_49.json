He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gaming rig for her boyfriend's birthday. They've been together four years, and she's the sole income. He's not employed, and she's struggling with financial stress and their relationship strain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the only one working, which is a lot of pressure. She's saving money and paying off debt, so this big purchase would be a strain. The boyfriend has asked for expensive gifts in the past, but this time it's a significant jump. The author feels she's supporting not just the relationship but also his lifestyle, which might be contributing to her resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel unappreciated or that his desires are being ignored. The question is whether her decision is justified. Financial responsibility is important, especially when there's debt and she's the sole provider. The author feels it's unfair to spend that money when she can't even afford to buy herself more than books and socks. Plus, she's concerned about his lack of employment and the imbalance in their contributions.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, the balance in the relationship, and communication. If the author hasn't communicated her financial constraints clearly, maybe that's part of the issue. However, she has been trying to save and mentioned she can't afford it. The boyfriend's request might be seen as excessive given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. She's prioritizing her financial health and setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The boyfriend needs to understand the financial reality and perhaps take steps to contribute, like getting a job. The answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
