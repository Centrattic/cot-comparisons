He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gaming rig for her boyfriend's birthday. First, I need to consider the context provided.\n\nThe couple has been together four years. The woman is the sole income earner, working 10+ hour shifts, while the boyfriend isn't employed, even though he claims to be looking. She's struggling with financial strain, trying to pay off debt and build savings. Their relationship has been under stress because she's the only one contributing financially. The boyfriend usually asks for small items, but this time it's a significant expense. She feels resentful and doesn't want to spend that much, especially since she didn't get much for her own birthday.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility, relationship dynamics, and communication. The woman is the sole provider and is dealing with financial pressures. The boyfriend's request is expensive and adds to her stress. She's also mentioned feeling like she's raising a kid instead of being in a partnership, which is a valid concern about imbalance in the relationship.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not obligated to spend money she can't afford, especially when it's causing resentment. The boyfriend's lack of employment is contributing to the issue. The woman has a right to prioritize her financial stability and address the relationship's imbalance. She's also not the one asking for the expensive gift; he is. So, refusing an expensive gift that strains her finances isn't necessarily wrong. However, it's important to consider communication. If she hasn't discussed her feelings about the financial contributions and the impact on the relationship, that might be a separate issue. But based on the given information, she's making a choice that's in her best interest and the relationship's long-term health.\n\nThe question is whether not giving the gift makes her the asshole. Given the circumstances, the answer is likely B (No). She's not wrong for prioritizing her financial responsibilities and addressing the imbalance in the relationship.\n"
