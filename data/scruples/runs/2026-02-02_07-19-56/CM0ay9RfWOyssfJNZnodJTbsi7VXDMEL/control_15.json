He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend an expensive gift. The situation is that the boyfriend is unemployed, and the author is the sole income earner working long hours. The author is struggling with debt and saving money, but the boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibilities. The author is providing for the relationship, while the boyfriend isn't contributing. The author feels like they're supporting someone else financially, which can be a significant source of stress and resentment. Gifts, especially expensive ones, are often expected to be given from available funds, but if the author is already managing debt and trying to save, spending $2000 might not be feasible.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the relationship dynamics. The author mentions the relationship has been straining for a couple of years because of the financial strain and the boyfriend's lack of employment. The author feels like they're raising a child, implying the boyfriend isn't pulling his weight. The boyfriend is described as a good guy who doesn't ask for much, but the request here is significant. The author is conflicted because they usually get smaller gifts but feel this is too much.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a financial responsibility standpoint, the author isn't obligated to spend money they can't afford, especially when there's an imbalance in contributions to the relationship. The author's decision to prioritize their financial goals over an expensive gift isn't necessarily wrong. They're also considering the boyfriend's lack of job, which might affect his ability to earn the money himself. \n\nHowever, the ethical angle could be that a birthday gift is a kind gesture, and the author might feel guilty for not giving it. But given the circumstances, the author's financial constraints and the relationship's existing issues might justify their decision. The key here is that the author is making a choice based on their ability to afford the gift and their relationship's state. They are not being unreasonable in their request for the boyfriend to contribute or find a job. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people often expect partners to give gifts, but it's not a legal or moral obligation. The author is prioritizing their financial stability and addressing the underlying issues in the relationship. The boyfriend's request might be seen as expecting the author to cover his personal wants without contributing himself. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to financial responsibilities and relationship health. The answer should be B.\n"
