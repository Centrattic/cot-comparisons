He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. They've been together four years, and the author is the sole income earner, working long hours. The boyfriend doesn't have a job and the author feels like he's not contributing, which is causing strain in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The author is struggling with credit card debt and trying to save, which is a legitimate concern. If she can't afford a $2000 gift without compromising her financial goals, then it's reasonable for her to say no. Gifts should be given from a place of comfort, not stress.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The boyfriend is described as a good guy but the author feels resentful. The key here is whether the boyfriend is aware of the financial situation and the author's efforts. If the author has communicated her difficulties and he still expects an expensive gift, that's on him. But if she hasn't had that conversation, maybe he's not aware. The author mentions she's been giving small things, so maybe she's been accommodating his requests, but this time the price is too high. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation of reciprocity. The author got books and socks for her birthday, which she mentioned earlier. If the boyfriend didn't get her what she wanted, but the author is still giving expensive gifts to him, that could be an issue. The author might feel that her efforts aren't matched, which adds to her resentment.\n\nThe question of whether the author is in the wrong hinges on communication and mutual understanding. If she hasn't discussed her financial constraints with him, then she might be expected to handle it gracefully without a direct conversation. But since she's working hard and he's not contributing, it's fair for her to set boundaries. The author feels like she's \"raising a kid,\" which suggests a power imbalance in the relationship. The boyfriend's lack of a job and his reliance on her financially is a valid point of tension.\n\nIn terms of the birthday gift, the author is prioritizing her financial health over an expensive present. That's a responsible choice. The boyfriend might feel hurt, but if he's in a position where he can't contribute, expecting a costly gift isn't fair. The author's resentment is a sign that this issue needs to be addressed, not just for the gift but for the overall relationship's sustainability.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend beyond her means, especially if the boyfriend isn't contributing to their shared expenses. The main problem here might be the lack of communication and the boyfriend's financial situation rather than the author's decision to not buy the expensive gift. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
