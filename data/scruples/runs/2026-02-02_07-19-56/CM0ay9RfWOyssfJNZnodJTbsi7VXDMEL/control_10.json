He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for four years. The author is the sole income earner, working 10+ hour shifts. Her boyfriend isn't employed, and she can't verify if he's actually looking for a job. They've had relationship strain because she's the one supporting them financially, and he's playing games all day. She's trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and build a nest egg, but her income isn't high. \n\nThe boyfriend usually asks for small items like games or Funko Pops, which she usually gets. Now he wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. She's conflicted because she feels bad but also resents having to spend so much when she can't even get what she wants. She's been telling him she'll see, but she's getting more resentful and even doesn't want to get the small things anymore. She feels like he should get a job to afford it himself, not wanting to feel like she's raising a kid.\n\nThe main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author is the sole provider, which can be a source of tension. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and she's struggling with her own financial goals. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, in relationships, financial decisions involve mutual understanding and compromise. However, she's in a position where she's the only one working, and she's making sacrifices. The boyfriend's lack of employment and her inability to verify his job search adds to the tension. She's not being selfish; she's prioritizing debt and savings, which are important for their future. Refusing to spend on a $2000 item when she can't even get her own gifts might seem harsh, but given the circumstances, it's about her financial stability. \n\nThe key points are: her financial responsibility, the boyfriend's unemployment, and the relationship strain. She's communicating her constraints (\"we'll see\"), but the resentment is building because of the imbalance. She feels she's not in a partnership but a caregiver role. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, I think she's not. She's making a choice based on her financial reality and the relationship dynamics. The boyfriend should be contributing, but since he isn't, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her own financial health. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
