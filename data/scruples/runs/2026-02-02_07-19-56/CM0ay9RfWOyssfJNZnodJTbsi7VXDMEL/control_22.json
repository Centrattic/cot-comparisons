He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive birthday gift. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together four years. The author is the sole income earner, working long hours. The boyfriend isn't employed, and she feels he's not looking seriously for work. Their relationship is strained because of financial stress. She's saving to pay off debt and build a nest egg. He usually gets small gifts but now wants a $2000 gaming rig. She's conflicted because she can't afford it and feels resentful, especially since he didn't get her much for her birthday.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not getting the gift. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let me think. Financial responsibilities are a big part of relationships. If she's the sole provider and he's not contributing, it's understandable she's frustrated. The gift in question is expensive, and she's trying to save. She's already given him smaller gifts, which shows she's made an effort. But now a $2000 item is beyond her means. \n\nIs she obligated to spend beyond her means for a gift? Probably not. Relationships should involve mutual support, and if he's not contributing financially, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her own financial stability. Also, she mentions he didn't get her much for her birthday, which might indicate a pattern of imbalance. \n\nHe's a good guy but the situation is causing strain. She's not refusing to give any gift (\"we'll see\"), just being cautious. Her feelings of resentment are valid given the circumstances. The key point is whether she's wrong for not spending money she can't afford, especially when the relationship's financial dynamics are already problematic. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She has valid reasons related to financial responsibility and the existing stress in the relationship. She's not being selfish; she's prioritizing her own needs and the relationship's health. The boyfriend's behavior (not working, not contributing) is a bigger issue here. So, the author isn't the asshole for not giving the expensive gift.\n"
