He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on their boyfriend's birthday gift. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the relationship has been under strain for a couple of years. The author is the sole income earner, working 10+ hour shifts, while the boyfriend doesn't have a job. The author is saving money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. They mention that the boyfriend asks for small things like games and Funko Pops, which the author usually buys. Now he wants a $2000 gaming rig. The author feels resentful because he's not contributing financially and they feel like they're the only one working.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, relationship dynamics, and expectations. The author is struggling with their own financial goals and the boyfriend's lack of contribution. They feel like they're supporting a kid instead of a partner. The boyfriend is described as a good guy but not contributing. The author feels bad about not getting the expensive gift but also doesn't want to compromise their savings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners should contribute, especially financially if possible. The boyfriend's unemployment is a significant issue here. The author has a right to prioritize their own financial stability. Not wanting to spend a large sum on a gift when they can't verify the boyfriend's job search efforts seems reasonable. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to maintain their own well-being and financial goals. The boyfriend's request might be unreasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their decision based on their financial situation and the imbalance in the relationship.\n"
