He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on their boyfriend's birthday gift. The author's main points are that they're the sole income provider, working long hours, and their partner isn't working and seems to be playing games a lot. They're struggling with debt and saving, and the boyfriend wants an expensive gaming rig. The author feels resentful and doesn't want to feel like they're \"raising a kid.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a tough financial situation. They have responsibilities, debt, and are working hard. It's reasonable for them to prioritize their financial goals. On the other hand, the boyfriend's request is a significant expense. But maybe he's not aware of the author's financial constraints, or maybe he expects the author to cover his hobbies because they're in a relationship.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for not giving the gift. Financial decisions in relationships can be complex. If the author can't afford it without causing further strain, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, communication is key. The author mentioned they've been saying \"we'll see\" and not giving the small things anymore. Maybe they haven't communicated their financial situation clearly. But if the author is being honest about their inability to spend due to their circumstances, then it's their right to prioritize their needs. The boyfriend not having a job is part of the dynamic here. The author might feel it's unfair to support his hobbies when they're the sole provider. \n\nAlso, the author's resentment suggests that the financial burden is affecting the relationship. The question is whether the author's decision to not spend is justified. If they've been saving, paying off debt, and the partner isn't contributing, the author isn't wrong in refusing. However, maybe the author should have discussed finances more openly or set boundaries earlier. But given the situation, the author's feelings are valid. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have valid reasons and financial constraints.\n"
