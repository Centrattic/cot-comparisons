He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a partner in a four-year relationship, and they're the sole income earner in the household. Their boyfriend doesn't have a job, even though he claims he's looking. The author works long hours, 10+ a day, and is trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and build a nest egg. They mention that their income isn't very high. The boyfriend is described as a good guy who usually doesn't ask for much for holidays and birthdays, but he does want small things like games or Funko Pops, which the author usually buys. Now, for his upcoming birthday, he's asking for a $2000 gaming rig. The author feels bad about not being able to afford this, especially since for their own birthday, they were given just a couple of books and socks, even though they'd mentioned wanting something else. The author is conflicted, feeling resentful and not wanting to spend so much on the boyfriend, and is considering that he should get a job to pay for it himself. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend that much money on the boyfriend's birthday gift.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious what I think. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is the sole financial provider, and the boyfriend doesn't have a job. The author is under financial stress, working long hours, and is trying to save. The boyfriend is asking for a $2000 gift, which is a significant expense. The author feels like they're shouldering all the financial responsibilities and are resentful about it. The author is also comparing the gifts given to each other\u2014when the author's birthday came around, the boyfriend only gave books and socks, even though the author had mentioned wanting something else. This might indicate that the boyfriend isn't as considerate with the author's wants, but maybe that's a separate issue.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, if the boyfriend isn't contributing to the household income, it's reasonable for the author to feel that the boyfriend should cover his own expenses. If the author can't afford a $2000 gift while saving for debt and a nest egg, then not being able to give it is understandable. However, in a relationship, expectations around gifts and generosity can vary. The boyfriend might feel that the author isn't being generous enough, but the author is dealing with financial constraints and possible resentment about the boyfriend not contributing.\n\nThe author's feelings of resentment are valid. If one partner isn't contributing to the household financially and is instead relying on the other, it can lead to tension. The author is working long hours and may feel that the relationship is becoming unbalanced. The boyfriend's request for an expensive gift might seem out of proportion to the author's current financial situation and the underlying issues in their relationship.\n\nHowever, in many relationships, partners expect to give gifts that are meaningful, even if they're expensive. The boyfriend might have a right to feel upset if the author doesn't fulfill a requested gift, especially if it's something they really want. But the author's financial situation is a limiting factor. The key here is whether the author is responsible for covering the boyfriend's personal expenses when the boyfriend isn't contributing to the household. If the author is the sole provider, they have the right to prioritize their financial goals and their own well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions feeling like they're raising a kid instead of being in a relationship. This suggests that the author feels the boyfriend is not taking on his fair share of responsibilities, which is a valid concern. In that context, the author's decision to not spend $2000 on a gift could be seen as a necessary boundary, especially if the author is already struggling financially and emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is that he's been treated well and usually gets small gifts. He might not realize the financial strain the author is under. The author's communication of their inability to give the expensive gift now might be necessary, but it could affect the relationship dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend beyond their means on a gift, especially given the financial and emotional context. The underlying issues with the boyfriend's job situation and the author's financial responsibilities are significant factors. The author has the right to prioritize their financial stability and set boundaries. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
