He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a four-year relationship and is the sole provider, working long hours. Her boyfriend doesn't have a job, even though he says he's looking. The author is struggling with debt and trying to save, and now his birthday is approaching. He wants a $2000 gaming rig, which feels like a lot to the author. She's conflicted because she usually gets him small things but this is expensive. She feels like he should be working and not relying on her for such a big gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The author is the only income, and she's dealing with debt. Buying a $2000 item might be a significant strain. If she's trying to save and pay off debt, spending a large chunk of her savings on a gift might not be wise. But maybe in a relationship, gifts are part of showing love. However, if the boyfriend isn't contributing financially and the author is shouldering everything, that could be an issue.\n\nNext, communication. The author mentions she's been trying to save and that their relationship has been strained because of the financial stress. She's been avoiding giving the gift, saying \"we'll see,\" which might be causing tension. But is she in the wrong for not wanting to spend when she's already overburdened? The boyfriend might feel unappreciated if he doesn't get the gift he wants, especially if he's used to getting smaller things. But on the other hand, the author is stressed and feels like she's carrying the relationship financially.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's responsibility. If he's not working and she's the sole provider, maybe he should be contributing in other ways, like helping with chores or emotional support. But the author is frustrated that he's not working, so it's a two-way issue. The problem isn't just about the gift but the underlying financial imbalance.\n\nIs the author being selfish by not giving the gift? If she's already stretched thin, maybe it's reasonable to prioritize her financial goals. However, relationships often involve compromise. If she's not giving any gift, even small ones, that could hurt the boyfriend's feelings. But maybe the author is justified in her feelings of resentment and needs to set boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility versus relationship expectations. The author is trying to manage her finances responsibly, but the boyfriend expects a significant gift. Since he's not contributing financially, the author might feel it's unfair for him to expect such an expensive item. It's also about whether the boyfriend's request is realistic given their current situation.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, if she's honest with him about her financial constraints and explains that she can't afford the gift, she's not necessarily in the wrong. But if she's avoiding communication and holding onto resentment, that could be an issue. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not giving the gift. Given the circumstances, she might not be in the wrong because she's managing her own financial health and the boyfriend isn't contributing. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
