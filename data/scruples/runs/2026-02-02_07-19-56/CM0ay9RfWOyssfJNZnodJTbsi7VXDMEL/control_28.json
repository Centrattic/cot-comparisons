He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a 4-year relationship where they are the sole breadwinner, their boyfriend isn't working and spends time gaming. The boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but the author can't afford it and is struggling with their own finances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and their own stress from shouldering all the financial burdens. They mention the relationship has been straining because of this. The boyfriend, on the other hand, isn't employed and expects a significant gift, which might be seen as unreasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe author feels resentful because they have to save for debt and a nest egg, and they're not making a lot. They also point out that when they asked for something for their birthday, they got socks and books, which they reminded him about. That might indicate some imbalance in the gift-giving.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, expectations in a relationship, and mutual support. The author isn't being selfish if the boyfriend isn't contributing to their own needs, especially when the author is also struggling financially. The boyfriend's request for an expensive item when he isn't working could be seen as taking advantage of the author's financial situation.\n\nAlso, the author's resentment about being the sole provider is valid. Relationships typically require both partners to contribute, whether through financial means or other support. If the boyfriend is not working and not contributing, the author has the right to set boundaries.\n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's expectations might be unreasonable given his own lack of financial contribution. The author is prioritizing their financial stability and addressing the imbalance in the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
