He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for four years. The author is the sole income earner, working long hours. The boyfriend isn't employed, and the author feels he's not looking for a job effectively. They've been saving money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. The birthday gift in question is a $2000 gaming rig, which the author is reluctant to buy because of financial constraints. The author feels resentful about supporting the boyfriend financially while he doesn't contribute.\n\nNow, the key points here are financial responsibility, relationship dynamics, and expectations. The author is struggling with their own financial goals and the stress of being the sole provider. The boyfriend's request seems significant given their financial situation. The author isn't refusing to give any gifts but is hesitant about a costly one. \n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for prioritizing their financial stability over a gift. In relationships, it's important for both partners to contribute, especially financially. The boyfriend's lack of employment might be a valid concern for the author. Gifts should be mutually agreed upon, and the author's feelings of resentment suggest an imbalance. The author isn't avoiding all gifts but is questioning the expense given the circumstances. \n\nAlso, the author mentions trying to save and pay off debt, which is a responsible financial move. The boyfriend's request might not consider the author's financial priorities. The author's hesitation isn't just about the money but also about the underlying issues of the relationship's balance. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not wanting to spend that amount, considering their financial situation and the boyfriend's lack of contribution. The boyfriend's request might be unreasonable given the context. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
