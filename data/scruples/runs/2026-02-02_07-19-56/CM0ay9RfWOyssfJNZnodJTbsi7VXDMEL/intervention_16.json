He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The key points here are the financial situation and their relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author is the sole income provider, working long hours, and there's a financial strain with credit card debt. The boyfriend isn't employed, and she feels he's not contributing, which is causing resentment. She's been buying him smaller items but is now being asked for a $2000 gift. She's conflicted because she can't afford it, especially since she had a modest birthday herself.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a financial responsibility standpoint, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her own financial goals, like paying off debt and building an emergency fund. If the boyfriend is indeed not working and the author is the only one supporting them, the expense of a gaming rig could be seen as a luxury she can't afford right now.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the relationship. The author mentions they've been together four years, and he's a good guy who usually asks for small things. The issue here is the significant cost difference. The author's feelings of resentment and the boyfriend's lack of contribution to their financial stability are important factors. \n\nIf the boyfriend is genuinely looking for a job, maybe there's a lack of communication or trust. But if he's not contributing, the author has a valid reason to set boundaries. The decision to not spend beyond her means isn't about being an asshole but about financial responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author is not in the wrong. Her choice to prioritize her financial health and set boundaries is justified given the circumstances. The answer should reflect that she's not the asshole here.\n"
