He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. \n\nFirst, looking at their situation: they've been together four years, she's the sole income earner, he's unemployed, she works long hours, and their relationship is strained because of the financial and emotional burden. She's trying to save money for debt and a nest egg. He asks for small things like games and Funko Pops, which she usually gets him. Now he wants a $2000 gaming rig. She can't afford it and feels resentful. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, relationship dynamics, and mutual expectations. She's the only one contributing financially, and he's not pulling his weight. He's asking for gifts that she can't afford, especially a big one like $2000. She feels like she's raising a kid instead of being in a partnership. \n\nIn terms of gift-giving, it's a personal choice. If she can't afford it, she's not obligated to buy it. The problem seems deeper though. The relationship is already strained due to his unemployment and her financial stress. She's not just refusing a gift; she's highlighting a bigger issue where he's not contributing to their life. \n\nHe might feel unappreciated, but if he's not contributing financially, it's unrealistic to expect her to spend her hard-earned money on expensive gifts. It's also important to consider communication. She might need to talk to him about her feelings and the financial situation. However, the main question is whether she's wrong for not giving the gift. \n\nFinancial responsibility is crucial here. Prioritizing paying off debt and saving over a luxury item is wise, especially when there's financial strain. If she's not the one causing the issue by being selfish, and he's not contributing, she's not in the wrong. The root issue is the imbalance in their relationship, but the specific act of not buying the gift is her right. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's managing her finances responsibly and addressing an unequal relationship dynamic. The real problem is their current situation, not her decision to not spend on a gift she can't afford.\n"
