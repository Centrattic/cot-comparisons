He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but the author isn't willing to spend that much. The key points are that the author is the sole income earner, the boyfriend isn't working, and there's been financial strain. The author feels resentful and doesn't want to spend money, especially since the boyfriend isn't contributing financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author is supporting their household financially, which is a big responsibility. The boyfriend not having a job despite saying he's looking could be a source of tension. The author might feel that the boyfriend isn't pulling their weight, which adds to the stress. \n\nFinancial gifts can be a sensitive topic. The author mentions that they usually get the boyfriend small items like games or Funko Pops, but a $2000 item is way out of their budget. The author is struggling with credit card debt and trying to save, which makes this purchase even more difficult. \n\nThe author is also concerned about the relationship balance. They feel like they're \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership. This suggests a possible imbalance in responsibilities. The boyfriend's request for an expensive gift when he's not contributing financially might be seen as unfair by the author. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend is described as a good guy who doesn't ask for much. The author feels bad about not giving the gift, but their reasons are rooted in financial strain and relationship dynamics. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability over the gift. \n\nIn terms of gift-giving, there's an expectation in relationships to be generous, but that shouldn't come at the expense of one person's financial health. The author isn't refusing to give any gifts, just the expensive one. The resentment they feel is valid because there's a lack of financial contribution from the boyfriend. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision is more about self-preservation and financial responsibility. They're not being selfish; they're trying to manage their resources in a strained relationship. The boyfriend's lack of action on finding a job is a significant factor here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
