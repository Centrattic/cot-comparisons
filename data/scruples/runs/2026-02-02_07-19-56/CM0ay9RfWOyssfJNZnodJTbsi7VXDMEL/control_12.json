He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The author is a girlfriend who's been in a 4-year relationship. She's the sole income provider, and her boyfriend isn't employed despite saying he's job hunting. She works long hours, and they've been having relationship strain because of this. He wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but she can't afford it right now. She feels resentful and doesn't want to spend that much, especially since he doesn't seem to be contributing financially. She's been saving for debt and a nest egg.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether not giving the expensive gift makes her the asshole. The factors here include financial responsibility, the boyfriend's lack of employment, and the dynamic of the relationship. \n\nThe author is clearly struggling with financial stress. She's the only one contributing, which can create an imbalance. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and she can't verify if he's actually looking for work. She's tried to save, and her own birthday gifts were minimal. \n\nIn relationships, mutual effort and compromise are important. If one partner isn't contributing, especially financially, it can lead to tension. The author's feelings of resentment are valid because she's shouldering all the financial burden. The question is whether her decision to not spend $2000 is wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's request is a big expense, and if he's not working, expecting his partner to cover that might be unreasonable. The author is prioritizing her financial stability, which is important. The fact that she usually gets him smaller gifts but is now struggling with a large one shows she's tried to be generous before. \n\nHowever, relationships also require communication. The author's approach is to say \"we'll see\" but might need to have a more direct conversation about finances and expectations. The key here is whether she's in the wrong for not giving the gift. Considering the financial strain and the boyfriend's lack of contribution, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her savings and not spend beyond her means. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). She's making a responsible financial decision given the circumstances and the imbalance in their relationship. The boyfriend needs to take responsibility for his own financial situation, and it's not her duty to cover his expenses, especially when there's existing strain.\n"
