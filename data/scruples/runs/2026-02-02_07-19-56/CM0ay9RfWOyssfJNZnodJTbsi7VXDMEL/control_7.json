He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on their boyfriend's birthday gift. The author is the sole provider, works long hours, and their partner is unemployed. The boyfriend has asked for expensive gaming gear, while the author feels resentful because they have financial obligations and their own birthday wasn't well-received.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility is key here. The author is managing credit card debt and saving, which is important for stability. Spending a large amount on a gift when they're already stretching their budget could be seen as irresponsible. The boyfriend's unemployment is a significant factor too; if he's not contributing financially, expecting an expensive gift might be unfair. \n\nThe author's feelings of resentment are valid. Relationships should be balanced, and if one person is shouldering all financial responsibilities, it can lead to strain. The boyfriend's reaction to not getting the gift might be hurtful, but the author's concern about financial priorities is reasonable. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The core issue is the financial burden and the imbalance in the relationship. The author isn't obligated to spend beyond their means, especially when their own needs and savings are at stake. The boyfriend not contributing financially complicates things further. \n\nIn terms of gift-giving, it's a personal choice. The author is within their rights to decide how much they can spend. The fact that the boyfriend didn't contribute to their birthday (they got socks and books they mentioned) adds to the imbalance. So, the author's decision isn't wrong given the circumstances. They're prioritizing their financial health and addressing the relationship dynamics.\n"
