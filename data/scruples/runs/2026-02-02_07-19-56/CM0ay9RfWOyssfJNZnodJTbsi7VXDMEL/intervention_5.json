He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The situation is that they've been together four years, she's the sole income earner, he's unemployed and she feels he's not contributing. She can't verify if he's actually looking for a job. The relationship has been strained because of this. She's been saving money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. The boyfriend has asked for a $2000 gift, which she's reluctant to give because she feels he should get a job. She's also mentioned that for her birthday, he got her books and socks, which made her feel like she got the short end of the stick.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to spend that much on his birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. She's the sole provider, he's not contributing financially. She's working long hours and is stressed about her financial situation. The boyfriend's request is significant, $2000. She feels resentful because she's the one covering everything and he's not helping out. She's also comparing his gift-giving to hers; he got her relatively cheap items while she's being asked for a big expense. \n\nThe key points are financial responsibility, fairness in relationships, and the concept of gift-giving in the context of contributions. In a relationship, both partners should ideally contribute to expenses, both financial and emotional. If one partner isn't contributing, it can create imbalance. The author might feel that her contributions are not being recognized or matched by her partner. \n\nHowever, giving gifts is often seen as a gesture of love and effort, not necessarily a transactional exchange. The author is struggling with the idea that she's being asked for a significant expense when she's the one supporting the relationship financially. On the other hand, the boyfriend's request might be seen as reasonable if he's expecting her to continue supporting their lifestyle. But he's also not contributing, which adds to the strain.\n\nThe author's resentment is valid because she's carrying the financial burden alone. She might feel that the gift request is unfair given the circumstances. Also, the fact that he got her a small gift while she's being asked for a big one could be a point of contention. However, gift-giving in a relationship isn't always equal, and sometimes it's about personal choice. But when there's a significant imbalance in contributions, the expectations might shift.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author is communicating her inability to get the expensive gift, which is a responsible move. She's not hiding her feelings but is trying to manage the situation. The boyfriend's reaction to this communication could also be a factor, but that's not detailed here. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author has a valid reason for her decision based on the financial strain and imbalance. She's not being selfish; she's trying to prioritize her financial goals and the health of the relationship by addressing the unequal contributions. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for making a choice that's necessary for her well-being and financial stability.\n"
