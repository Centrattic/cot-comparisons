He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't working, and the author is the sole income earner with long hours. They have financial stress and debt. The boyfriend usually gets small gifts, but this time he's asking for a big purchase. The author is struggling with resentment because they feel they're the only one contributing financially.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is working hard, managing debt, and trying to save. The boyfriend's unemployment is a point of tension. The key issue is whether it's reasonable to expect the author to spend a large amount on a birthday gift when they're under financial strain and the boyfriend isn't contributing income. \n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend doesn't ask for much, but this is a significant expense. The author feels it's unfair to spend that money when they can't even afford to buy what they want for themselves. The comparison to their own birthday gift (books and socks) highlights a disparity in expectations. \n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a common topic. Generally, it's considered fair for both partners to contribute to shared expenses, and it's okay to set boundaries on personal spending, especially when there are financial pressures. The boyfriend not having a job might be a red flag, but the author's main issue is the financial burden. \n\nThe question is if the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability over the gift. Since the author is in a position where they can't afford such a gift and the boyfriend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for them to say no. Being in the wrong would imply that the author should prioritize the gift despite their circumstances, which isn't the case here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
