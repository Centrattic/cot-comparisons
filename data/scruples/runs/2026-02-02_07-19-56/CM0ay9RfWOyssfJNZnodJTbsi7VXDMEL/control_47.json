He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gaming rig for her boyfriend's birthday. \n\nFirst, let's look at the details. The couple has been together for four years, and the woman is the sole income provider. Her boyfriend isn't working, and she can't confirm he's actively looking for a job. She's been working long hours and is struggling with debt. She usually buys him small gifts like games and Funko Pops, but now he wants a $2000 gaming rig. She feels resentful because she can't afford it and doesn't want to keep funding his hobbies when he's not contributing financially. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend treats her well and doesn't ask for much. She's conflicted because she feels guilty for not getting the expensive gift but also frustrated with his lack of financial contribution. The question is whether she's in the wrong for prioritizing her financial stability over the gift.\n\nI think the key points here are financial responsibility and mutual contribution in a relationship. If the boyfriend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for the woman to prioritize her financial goals, especially with debt and needing a savings. Spending $2000 on a gaming rig when she can't even afford to save might exacerbate her financial stress. The boyfriend's request seems excessive given the circumstances. She's not being inconsiderate by not giving the gift; she's making a responsible choice based on their current situation. \n\nAlso, the relationship's health is a factor. If he's not working and she feels like she's \"raising a kid,\" there's an imbalance. The resentment she feels is valid. The fact that she's trying to save and pay off debt shows responsibility. Not giving the expensive gift isn't about being an asshole but about financial practicality and setting boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
