He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together four years. The author is the sole income earner, working 10+ hour shifts. Her boyfriend isn't employed and she feels he's not making efforts to find a job, which is causing strain. She's trying to save money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. The boyfriend asks for small things like games and Funko Pops, which she usually buys, but now he wants a $2000 gaming rig. She's conflicted because she can't afford it and feels resentful, especially since her birthday gifts were minimal. She's considering not buying it and wants to know if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, relationship dynamics, and expectations. The author is in a tough spot financially, working hard, and the boyfriend's lack of contribution is causing stress. The question is whether she's wrong for not spending a large amount she can't afford.\n\nI think the main issue is the boyfriend's lack of contributing to the household financially. If he's not working, the burden on the author is heavy. She's trying to save and manage debt, so spending $2000 on a gift when they can't verify his job search efforts might not be responsible. Plus, she's already giving small gifts, which he's used to, but now he's asking for something expensive. Her prioritizing financial stability over a gift she can't afford makes sense. The resentment she feels is justified given the circumstances. So, she isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior (not working) is part of the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
