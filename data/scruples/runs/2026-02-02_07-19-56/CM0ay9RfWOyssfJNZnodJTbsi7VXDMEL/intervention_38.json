He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The author's boyfriend is asking for a $2000 gaming rig, but the author is struggling financially, working long hours, and the boyfriend isn't employed. The author feels resentful because they're the sole income provider and the boyfriend's requests are adding to their financial stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author is supporting the relationship financially, which can be a big deal. The boyfriend isn't contributing, and the author is feeling like they're \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership. That's a key point. In a healthy relationship, both partners should contribute in some way, even if it's not monetary. But if one is shouldering all the financial burden, it can create resentment.\n\nThe author is also saving for debt and a nest egg, which shows they're responsible with their money. The boyfriend's request for an expensive gift could be seen as inconsiderate given the author's situation. However, the author has given him smaller gifts in the past, so maybe there's a pattern here. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable for not wanting to spend $2000 on a birthday gift.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings of resentment are valid. If the boyfriend isn't contributing to the household or the finances, the author might feel it's unfair to spend a large amount on him. The author is also a good partner, giving small things when possible, but this is a significant expense. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not wanting to spend the money? Well, in a relationship, expectations around gifts can vary. If the boyfriend has always asked for small things and suddenly wants something expensive, the author is justified in questioning it. Plus, the financial strain is real. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their financial health and possibly the future stability of the relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's job situation is also a factor. If he's not working, the author is right to feel like the responsibility is on them. The author's resentment is about the imbalance in the relationship, not just the gift. So not giving the expensive gift isn't about being cheap, but about the underlying issues of financial responsibility and partnership.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend the money. They have valid reasons related to their financial situation and the imbalance in the relationship. The boyfriend might need to reflect on his contributions, but the author is justified in their decision.\n"
