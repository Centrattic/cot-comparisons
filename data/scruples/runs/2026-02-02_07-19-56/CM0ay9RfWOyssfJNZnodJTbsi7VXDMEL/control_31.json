He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The author is a woman in a 4-year relationship where she's the sole provider. Her boyfriend doesn't have a job, plays games a lot, and she's struggling with saving money and paying off debt. He wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but she can't afford it and feels resentful. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not giving it to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is the only one contributing financially, which is causing strain. The boyfriend's lack of a job and the author's hard work are creating tension. She's being asked to spend a significant amount on a gift, which she can't afford. The question is about whether she's being unreasonable by not fulfilling this request.\n\nGift-giving in relationships often involves mutual effort and consideration. If one partner is not contributing financially and the other is struggling, there's an imbalance. The author is trying to save money and pay off debt, which is a valid financial priority. The boyfriend's requests, while small in the past, now include a large expense. The author might feel that he should be contributing rather than expecting her to cover it all. \n\nBut is she in the wrong for not giving the gift? Well, in a relationship, both partners should ideally contribute in ways beyond just finances, like emotional support and shared responsibilities. However, if one is not contributing financially and the other is shouldering all the costs, that can create resentment. The author's frustration is understandable. She's working long hours, and her boyfriend's lack of job search progress adds to her stress.\n\nThe question is about her decision to not give the expensive gift. Is that the right move? From a financial perspective, if she's struggling, she's justified in prioritizing her savings and debt over a $2000 purchase. Gifts should be within one's means, especially when there are financial pressures. The boyfriend's request might be reasonable if he were contributing, but under these circumstances, the author's refusal isn't unreasonable. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. If she's cutting back on gifts now, maybe communication is needed. But the core issue is the financial imbalance. The author's resentment is valid. So, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong) because she's prioritizing her financial stability and addressing the underlying issues in the relationship.\n"
