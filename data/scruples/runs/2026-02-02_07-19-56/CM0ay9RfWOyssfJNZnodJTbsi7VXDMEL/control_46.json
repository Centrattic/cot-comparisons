He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if not giving their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday is the wrong thing to do. They've been in a relationship for four years, and the author is the sole income provider. The boyfriend isn't working, and the author is getting tired of being the only one supporting them financially. The boyfriend wants this expensive gift, but the author is struggling with their own debts and savings.\n\nFirst, I should consider the financial responsibilities in a relationship. The author is working long hours and managing credit card debt. If the boyfriend isn't contributing financially, it's reasonable for the author to feel the strain. The boyfriend asking for an expensive gift when he isn't contributing might be a red flag. The author might feel like they're funding the relationship entirely, which isn't balanced.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. The author has mentioned that the boyfriend's requests are adding to their stress. They've tried to save money and have to prioritize their financial goals. The boyfriend being unemployed and not able to verify if he's actually job hunting could be a source of tension. The author's resentment is understandable in this context.\n\nThe author's feelings of resentment and not wanting to spend on small things now might indicate deeper issues. The boyfriend not reciprocating or contributing could be making the author feel like they're in a one-sided relationship. The expensive gift request might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.\n\nHowever, the author is also feeling guilty, which is normal. They might feel they should be generous, but if the relationship is causing financial stress and the other person isn't pulling their weight, it's a valid concern. The key here is the balance of contributions in a relationship\u2014emotional, financial, and effort-wise.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is under financial stress, the boyfriend isn't contributing, and the request is expensive. The author's decision to not give the gift is more about their financial reality and the imbalance in their relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's situation and behavior might be the real issue.\n"
