He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not giving a boyfriend an expensive gift for his birthday. The author is the only one with an income, the boyfriend isn't working, and there's financial strain. The boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig, which the author can't afford. The author is considering not giving it and maybe even small gifts now because of resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects. The author is in a difficult position, financially. They mentioned saving for debt and a nest egg. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is causing stress. The author feels like they're supporting a child rather than a partner. The key points here are financial responsibility and mutual contribution in a relationship.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be wrong but isn't sure. So, the answer needs to balance both perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend's request is for something expensive, which the author can't afford. On the other, the author's resentment is valid because of the financial imbalance. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should contribute, either through income or other means. Since the boyfriend isn't working, it's reasonable for the author to feel that he should be responsible for his own expenses, especially non-essentials like a gaming rig. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing their financial goals. Also, the boyfriend's lack of job search verification adds to the author's stress. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to manage their finances and set boundaries, especially when the relationship is causing them financial and emotional strain. The key is that the author is making a responsible decision based on their circumstances, and the boyfriend should take responsibility for his own needs.\n"
