He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive birthday gift. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together four years. She's the sole income, working long hours, and he's unemployed despite saying he's looking for a job. The author mentions that their relationship has been strained because he's not contributing financially. She's saving money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. He usually gets small things like games or Funko Pops, but this time he wants a $2000 gaming rig. She's struggling with whether to buy it, feeling resentful, and wants him to get a job instead. She got him small things before but now can't afford the big gift. She feels guilty but also frustrated.\n\nNow, the key points here: financial responsibilities in a relationship, communication, and mutual effort. The author is the sole provider, which is a big burden. Her boyfriend's lack of employment is a significant issue because it contributes to the financial strain. She's trying to manage her finances responsibly, saving for debt and emergencies. The $2000 gift is a large expense for her, especially when she can't verify his job search efforts. She's also mentioned feeling like she's \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership, which suggests imbalance.\n\nIs she in the wrong? If she's struggling financially and the boyfriend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her financial goals. Gifts, especially expensive ones, are discretionary. If he expects her to spend money she can't afford, especially when he's not contributing financially, that's a problem. However, relationships do require some level of sacrifice. But in this case, the main issue is the financial imbalance. She's not obligated to spend beyond her means, especially when there's an ongoing issue with his employment. She might need to communicate her reasons clearly and set boundaries. The boyfriend's request might be unrealistic given their financial situation. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
