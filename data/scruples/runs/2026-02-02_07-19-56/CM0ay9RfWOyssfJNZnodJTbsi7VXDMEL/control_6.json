He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to buy their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The couple has been together for four years, and the author is the sole income earner. The boyfriend isn't employed, and she feels he's not contributing financially, just sitting at home gaming. She's struggling with debt and trying to save, and the gaming rig is a $2000 expense. She usually buys him smaller items, but this feels different. She feels resentful because she can't afford it and wants him to get a job instead.\n\nNow, the key points here are financial responsibility and relationship dynamics. The author is in a tough spot where she's working long hours, dealing with debt, and trying to save. Her boyfriend's lack of employment is a source of strain. Gift-giving can be a sensitive area, especially when there's financial pressure. \n\nIs she wrong for not wanting to spend that much? Well, she's prioritizing her financial goals over a gift. The boyfriend's request isn't essential, so she's not neglecting his needs but rather making a choice based on her circumstances. The fact that she's been saving for debt and a nest egg shows responsibility. Also, she's trying to communicate her constraints (\"we'll see, give me some time\"), which is a healthy approach.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe there's an expectation in relationships to consider each other's desires, but when one partner isn't contributing financially, that balance shifts. The author isn't denying him small things but is setting a boundary for a costly item. It's about fairness and sustainability. She's also feeling like she's \"raising a kid,\" indicating she wants mutual contribution.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a responsible decision based on her financial reality. The boyfriend's lack of employment is a bigger issue here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
