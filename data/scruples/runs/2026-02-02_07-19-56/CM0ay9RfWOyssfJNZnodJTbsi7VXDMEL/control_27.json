He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they're asking if it's wrong not to give their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. The context is that they've been together four years, the author is the sole provider, and the boyfriend isn't working despite saying he's looking. The author is struggling with debt and trying to save, while the boyfriend wants an expensive gift. The author feels resentful because they're the only one working and the boyfriend isn't contributing financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial situation. The author is the sole income earner, working long hours, and is trying to pay off debt and save. That's a significant responsibility. The boyfriend isn't working, so he's not contributing to the household finances. In a relationship, it's generally expected that both partners contribute to household expenses, whether through income or other means. If the boyfriend isn't working, it's understandable that the author feels he should cover his own expenses, especially a luxury item like a gaming rig.\n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend usually asks for small things like games or Funko Pops, which they can afford. But a $2000 item is a big jump. The author feels it's unfair to spend that much when they can't even afford to buy themselves a couple of books they asked for. That seems like a valid concern. Financial priorities are important, and the author is trying to manage their money responsibly.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The author feels like they're \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership. This resentment is justified if the boyfriend isn't contributing to the relationship in a balanced way. Healthy relationships require mutual support and contributions. If one partner is constantly shouldering all the responsibilities, it can lead to strain and dissatisfaction.\n\nThe boyfriend's request for an expensive gift might not be unreasonable if he were contributing to the household. But since he isn't working and the author is the sole provider, expecting the author to spend a large sum on him could be seen as unfair. The author is within their rights to prioritize their financial stability and debt repayment over the request.\n\nAdditionally, the author has been trying to communicate by saying \"we'll see, give me some time,\" which shows they're being honest about their financial limitations. The boyfriend might not be aware of the extent of the author's financial struggles. It's important to have open communication about money in a relationship, and the author is doing that as much as possible given the situation.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't the one asking for unreasonable things. They're trying to balance their own needs and the relationship's needs. The boyfriend's desire for a gaming rig is a personal want, especially when the author is already stretched thin. The author's decision to not spend $2000 is a responsible financial choice, especially considering their priorities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not wanting to spend that much, given the financial dynamics of their relationship. The boyfriend's job situation and lack of contribution play a role here. The author is making a choice that aligns with their financial priorities and the imbalance in the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
