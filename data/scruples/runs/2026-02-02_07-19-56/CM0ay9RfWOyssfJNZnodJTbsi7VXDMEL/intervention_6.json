He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. The author is the sole income in the household, the boyfriend isn't working, and the author is dealing with financial strain from debt and trying to save. They feel resentful because they're covering all expenses, and the boyfriend seems to be gaming all day.\n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot. They're working long hours and handling all the financial responsibilities. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and the author can't afford it without compromising their savings goals. The author has a valid reason to prioritize their financial stability, especially since they mentioned the relationship has been straining due to these issues.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author has been giving small gifts before but is now struggling with a bigger request. They feel like they're not being fair if they can't afford it, especially when their own needs (debt, savings) are important. The boyfriend's lack of employment is a significant factor here. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their own financial health and the future of the relationship by wanting the boyfriend to contribute.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt if he was expecting a gift he can't afford. But the author isn't refusing to give any gift; they're questioning the feasibility of a $2000 item when their own needs are pressing. The author is also considering the long-term aspect of the relationship, wanting the boyfriend to start contributing financially instead of relying on them entirely. \n\nThe resentment mentioned by the author is a sign that the current dynamic is unsustainable. It's important for both partners to communicate about financial expectations and responsibilities. The author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries, especially when their well-being is at stake. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision based on their financial situation and the need for balance in the relationship. The real issue might be the underlying problems about the boyfriend's employment and how they're managing their finances together. The author is taking a stand to address these issues, which is necessary for a healthy relationship.\n"
