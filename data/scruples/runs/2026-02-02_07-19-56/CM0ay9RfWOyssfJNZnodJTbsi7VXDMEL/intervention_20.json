He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not getting their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The author is the sole income provider, and the boyfriend isn't working, which is causing financial strain and relationship stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial situation. The author is working long hours and managing debt, which is a significant burden. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, and the author feels like they're supporting someone without mutual effort. The expense of $2000 is a lot for the author, especially when they\u2019re trying to save.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. The author mentioned they've been telling the boyfriend \"we'll see\" as the birthday approaches, which might be causing the man anxiety or confusion. But the author's resentment is understandable given the circumstances. The author feels they're being asked to spend beyond their means on items the boyfriend sees as small, while the author's own birthday was met with minimal gifts.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and financial responsibility. In a relationship, both partners should contribute where possible. The boyfriend not having a job is a red flag in terms of financial equality. The author has a right to prioritize their financial responsibilities, especially when they're managing debt and trying to build savings. The $2000 gaming rig is a luxury that the author can't afford given their current situation.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author isn't denying the boyfriend all gifts, just the expensive ones. They're still getting small items, which shows they're trying to meet his needs within their means. The author's frustration is valid because they feel unappreciated and overburdened. The boyfriend might need to find employment to contribute, rather than expecting the author to cover all expenses.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author is not being selfish without cause. They're making a responsible financial decision based on their circumstances. The boyfriend's request is inconsiderate given the author's financial constraints. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial health and setting boundaries.\n"
