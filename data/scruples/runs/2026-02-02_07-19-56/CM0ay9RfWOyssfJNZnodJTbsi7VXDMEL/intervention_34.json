He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gaming rig for her boyfriend's birthday. She's been the sole income earner for four years, he's not working, and their relationship is strained because of financial stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend isn't employed, and the author is working long hours to support them both. She's saving for debt and a nest egg. The gift in question is expensive, while her birthday gifts to him were cheaper. The author feels resentful and doesn't want to give the expensive gift, but she's worried about being seen as an asshole. \n\nIn relationships, gift-giving often involves mutual consideration. However, when one partner is financially strained, especially being the sole provider, the expectations can be different. The boyfriend's request for a $2000 item while not contributing financially might be unrealistic. The author isn't refusing to give a gift entirely, just the expensive one, which is a reasonable stance given her circumstances.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and fairness. The author isn't being selfish without reason; she's prioritizing her financial stability. The boyfriend's lack of employment could be a factor in the relationship's broader issues. The author's feelings of resentment are valid given the imbalance. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's making a choice that's necessary for her well-being. The answer should be B (No).\n"
