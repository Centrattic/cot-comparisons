He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The situation is that they've been together four years, the author is the sole income, and the boyfriend doesn't have a job. The author is struggling financially, has debt, and feels resentful because the boyfriend isn't contributing. The boyfriend is asking for a $2000 gift, while the author got cheaper gifts for her own birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibility in a relationship. If one person is the sole provider and the other isn't contributing, that can create tension. The author feels like they're supporting a dependent rather than being in a partnership. The boyfriend's request for a $2000 item might be seen as unreasonable given their financial situation.\n\nBut then, gifts are also about thoughtfulness and effort. The author has been giving smaller gifts in the past, which the boyfriend seems happy with. Now, he's asking for something expensive, which the author can't afford without jeopardizing their financial goals. The author's resentment is understandable because they're working long hours and the boyfriend isn't contributing. \n\nHowever, relationships require communication. The author hasn't communicated their financial constraints clearly. They mentioned saying \"we'll see,\" but maybe they need to be more direct. The boyfriend might not realize the extent of their financial struggles. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, not giving a gift because they can't afford it isn't inherently wrong. People can have different priorities. The key issue here is the underlying dynamic where the author feels they're supporting the relationship alone. The boyfriend's lack of job and the author's financial strain are bigger factors. \n\nThe author might be right to prioritize their financial goals and not feel obligated to spend beyond their means. The boyfriend should be contributing if possible, but since he's not working, the author isn't obligated to fund his hobbies. The real problem might be deeper issues about the relationship's balance. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a responsible financial decision and addressing the imbalance in their relationship. They aren't obligated to spend money they don't have, especially when the other person isn't contributing. The mistake might be not communicating clearly enough, but the decision to not buy the expensive gift isn't wrong.\n"
