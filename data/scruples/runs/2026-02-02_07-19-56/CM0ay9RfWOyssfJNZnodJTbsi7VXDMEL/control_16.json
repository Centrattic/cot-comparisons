He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The situation is that they've been together four years, and the author is the sole income provider. The boyfriend isn't working, which has caused some strain. The author is saving money for debt and a nest egg, and they usually get him small gifts but now he wants a $2000 item.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is struggling financially, works long hours, and the boyfriend's lack of income is a source of tension. The author feels resentful about spending so much when they can't even get what they want for themselves. The key here is the balance between a partner's needs and the financial responsibilities in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both partners typically share financial responsibilities. If one is the sole provider, it can lead to an imbalance. The boyfriend's request for a $2000 gift might be seen as expecting the author to cover his wants when he isn't contributing. The author's feelings of resentment are valid because they're shouldering all the financial load. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the boyfriend asked for the gift despite the author having limited resources. The author's own birthday was met with unmet requests for items they had mentioned earlier. This could indicate that the boyfriend's expectations aren't aligned with the author's financial situation. \n\nIt's important to note that the author is trying to save, which is a responsible action. They might feel that the boyfriend isn't pulling his weight, leading to the author feeling like they're raising a child instead of being in a partnership. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should communicate better. The response of \"we'll see\" might have been unclear, and the boyfriend could be feeling ignored or unvalued. However, the author's primary concern is the financial strain and the need for the boyfriend to contribute. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about fairness and consideration. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability over an expensive gift, especially when it's causing resentment. The boyfriend's behavior (not having a job) is a contributing factor here. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are justified in not spending money they can't afford and in expecting mutual responsibility in the relationship.\n"
