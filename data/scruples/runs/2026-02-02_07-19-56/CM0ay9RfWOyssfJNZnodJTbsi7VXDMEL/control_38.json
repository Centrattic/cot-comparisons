He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gaming rig for their boyfriend's birthday. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they've been together for four years and are the sole income provider. Their boyfriend isn't working, and they feel he's not contributing, spending a lot of time gaming. The author is struggling with saving money for debt and a nest egg, and they can't afford to spend $2000. They feel resentful because they've been buying smaller gifts like games and Funko Pops, but this is a significant jump.\n\nThe boyfriend has been asking for this expensive gift, and the author is concerned about not being able to give it. They mention feeling like they're raising a kid instead of being in a partnership. The key points here are financial responsibility, the imbalance in contributions to the relationship, and the emotional toll on the author.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). Considering the situation, the author is in a tough spot. They're trying to manage their finances responsibly while dealing with a partner not contributing. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and the author's refusal isn't about being cheap but about financial constraints and wanting balance. The author's resentment is valid given the circumstances. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
