He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term relationship where the boyfriend is unemployed, and the author is the sole provider. The author is conflicted about buying an expensive gaming rig for his birthday, feeling resentful because she's the one supporting them financially, and he doesn't contribute. She's been saving money and has been buying smaller gifts for him before, but this time it's a big expense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been the sole income earner for four years, working long hours. That's a significant commitment. She's also trying to save money to pay off debt and build a nest egg, which is important for financial stability. The boyfriend, on the other hand, says he's looking for a job, but she can't verify that. She feels he's not doing enough and is instead gaming all day, which is straining the relationship. \n\nThe key issue here is the financial responsibility in the relationship. The author is struggling with whether it's fair to spend a large amount on a gift when he's not contributing to their finances. She also mentions that for her birthday, she got only small items, which she had to remind him about. This could indicate a pattern where she's giving more without reciprocal support.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not giving the expensive gift. From one angle, in a relationship, both partners should be able to support each other financially, especially when one is contributing significantly more. The boyfriend's unemployment and lack of visible job search might be contributing to her frustration. The author might feel that the gift is an unfair financial burden when he's not earning his share.\n\nOn the other hand, birthdays are supposed to be about celebration and thoughtfulness. If the boyfriend has been asking for this for a while, and the author has been buying smaller things, the expensive gift might feel expected. However, given their financial situation and her resentment, it's not just about the gift but the underlying issues of financial responsibility and equality in the relationship.\n\nThe author's feelings of resentment are valid. If the boyfriend isn't contributing, she might feel like she's taking care of him, which isn't healthy in a partnership. The decision to not spend the money on a gift could be a way to communicate that she expects him to contribute financially. However, the way she's handling it might come across as unfair or dismissive, especially if he genuinely expected the gift.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014being the sole provider, long hours, and the boyfriend not contributing financially\u2014it's more about the imbalance in their relationship. The author is making a choice to prioritize her financial goals and well-being. The boyfriend might need to take responsibility for his job search and financial contributions. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to spend money on something that exacerbates their existing issues. She's making a decision based on her circumstances and the need for a more balanced relationship.\n"
