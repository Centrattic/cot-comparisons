He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a four-year relationship where they are the sole provider. Their boyfriend doesn't have a job, and the author feels like he's not contributing, just playing games. The boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but the author can't afford it because they're saving money and have debt. They usually get him small gifts but are struggling with this expensive request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The author mentions they're the only income and work long hours. They're saving for debt and a nest egg. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and the author can't verify if he's actually looking for a job. The author feels resentful because they're supporting everything and might feel like they're being taken advantage of.\n\nBut then, in a relationship, both partners are supposed to support each other. If the boyfriend isn't contributing financially, it's a big deal. The author's resentment might be justified because they're shouldering all the financial burden. However, the author is also not meeting the boyfriend's emotional needs by not giving the gift, which could hurt his feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend isn't earning and the author is struggling, it's reasonable for them to prioritize their financial goals. The author is being honest about their inability to spend that much. The boyfriend's request is for a luxury item when the author is already stretched thin. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be neglecting the emotional aspect of the relationship. However, the root issue is the boyfriend's lack of contribution. The author's feelings of resentment and feeling like they're raising a kid instead of a partner indicate deeper issues. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend the money, especially since the boyfriend isn't contributing. The problem is more about the boyfriend's lack of effort in finding work, not the author's refusal to buy the gift. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
