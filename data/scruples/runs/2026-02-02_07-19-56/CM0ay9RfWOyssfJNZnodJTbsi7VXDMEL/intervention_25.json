He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together four years. The author is the sole income provider, working 10+ hour shifts, while the boyfriend isn't employed and seems to be playing games a lot. The author is struggling with debt and wants to save money. The boyfriend asks for small things usually, like games or Funko Pops, which the author buys. Now, for his birthday, he wants a $2000 gaming rig. The author feels resentful because they can't afford it, especially since they got only books and socks for their own birthday. They feel like they're raising a kid instead of a partner.\n\nThe author is considering not giving the expensive gift and is conflicted. They feel awful but also justified because of the financial strain and the boyfriend's lack of employment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the dynamics here. In a relationship, financial contributions and expectations can be tricky. The author is clearly under financial pressure, being the sole provider. The boyfriend's not working adds to the tension. The author's resentment isn't just about the gift but about the overall imbalance. The $2000 gift is a significant expense, especially when the author is trying to pay off debt and save. \n\nBut on the other hand, in a relationship, partners often give gifts to each other as a sign of affection. The boyfriend might expect the author to be able to afford it, not realizing the financial constraints. The author might feel that the boyfriend isn't contributing enough to their relationship, hence the resentment. However, the author hasn't communicated their financial situation clearly, leading to the current conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to spend the money? Well, considering their financial situation and the relationship's stress points, it's understandable. They might be prioritizing their financial stability over the gift. But relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the author hasn't discussed their financial struggles with the boyfriend, that could be a problem. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to give the gift. \n\nThe boyfriend's lack of employment is a significant factor here. If he's not contributing, the author might feel they're shouldering too much. The $2000 gift might be seen as an unnecessary expense when there are bigger issues to address. The author's priority should be their financial health and the relationship's overall stability. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving the expensive gift, especially given their circumstances. They're making a choice based on financial responsibility and the need for balance in the relationship. The answer would be B.\n"
