He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The situation is that they've been together four years, the author is the sole provider, and the boyfriend isn't employed. The author is saving money to pay off debt and feels resentful about spending $2000 on a gift when their own birthday was met with cheaper items.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is handling all the financial responsibilities, which is a big deal. The boyfriend isn't contributing, which can strain a relationship. The author's feelings of resentment are valid, especially if they're working long hours and the partner isn't pulling their weight. The question is about whether the author is wrong for not giving the gift.\n\nThe key points are financial responsibility, communication, and expectations. The author has been buying small gifts before, but this is a larger request. They mention they can't verify the boyfriend's job search, which might indicate a lack of transparency. The author's own birthday didn't get expensive gifts, so they're being consistent in a way, but maybe the issue is about the significant amount for the boyfriend's birthday. \n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. The user initially thought A but wants my take. In relationships, expectations vary. If the boyfriend has been asking for expensive things and the author is the sole provider, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The author isn't refusing to buy small gifts but is uncomfortable with a $2000 item. The boyfriend's unemployment is a point of contention, and the author's frustration is valid. \n\nBut is it fair to say the author is in the wrong? Well, they haven't given a reason why the gift is needed, just that he's a good guy and usually doesn't ask for much. However, the author is prioritizing their financial goals, which is important. The resentment comes from the imbalance. If the boyfriend knew about the financial situation, maybe he wouldn't ask for such an expensive gift. The author's decision to not spend that money could be seen as responsible, not wrong. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author should communicate more openly. The boyfriend might not realize how much of a strain his requests are causing. But the author is already trying to manage their savings and debt. The main issue here is the boyfriend's lack of contribution to the household and the author's financial burden. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're managing their finances responsibly and have a right to set limits, especially when there's a significant imbalance in contributions to the relationship. The boyfriend should take responsibility for his own spending and find a job to help support them both.\n"
