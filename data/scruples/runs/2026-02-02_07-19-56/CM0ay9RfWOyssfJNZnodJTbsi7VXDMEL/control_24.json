He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on their boyfriend's birthday gift. They mention they're the sole income provider, he's unemployed despite saying he's looking, and this has been causing strain. The boyfriend wants a new gaming rig, but the author can't afford it and feels resentful because their own birthday wasn't treated the same.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility is a big factor here. The author is managing debt and trying to save, so spending a large amount on a gift might not be feasible. They also express feeling like they're the only one contributing, which is a valid concern in a relationship. The boyfriend's request seems out of proportion to what the author can give, especially when their own gifts were minimal. \n\nThen there's the issue of communication. The author has tried to set boundaries by saying \"we'll see,\" but the boyfriend might not understand the financial constraints. However, the author's feelings of resentment and wanting the boyfriend to get a job are also valid points. It's about balance and mutual support. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should contribute, and if one is shouldering all responsibilities, it's reasonable to have limits. The author isn't being selfish by prioritizing their financial goals over an expensive gift. The key here is that the author's decision is based on financial realities and their own needs, which isn't wrong. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
