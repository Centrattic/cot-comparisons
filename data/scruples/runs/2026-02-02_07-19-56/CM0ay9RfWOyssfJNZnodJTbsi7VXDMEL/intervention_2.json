He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a relationship where the author is the sole provider, her boyfriend isn't working, and she's struggling to save money while he asks for an expensive gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is working 10+ hours, is the only income source, and has been saving for debt and a nest egg. The boyfriend isn't employed, which is causing strain. He's a good guy but wants a $2000 gaming rig. The author feels resentful and can't afford it, but she's considering if she's being a bad partner by not getting it.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nIn relationships, financial responsibilities and expectations vary. If the boyfriend is not contributing financially and the author is shouldering all the costs, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her financial goals. The expensive gift might not be feasible if it hinders her savings. However, the boyfriend might expect a significant gift, which could lead to conflict.\n\nBut is the author wrong? The key is the lack of communication and mutual understanding. The author hasn't discussed her financial pressures with him. If the boyfriend is asking for something expensive without contributing to the household, the author isn't obligated to spend beyond her means. The resentment indicates that she's not comfortable with this dynamic, which is valid. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not giving the gift. \n\nThe author's main issue is financial stress and the boyfriend's inactivity. Not spending money on a gift she can't afford doesn't make her the wrong party, especially if the relationship's structure is imbalanced. The boyfriend's expectations might be unrealistic given the circumstances. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author has the right to prioritize her financial stability and communicate her limits without guilt.\n"
