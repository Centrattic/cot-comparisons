He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but she can't afford it and feels resentful because he's not working. She's been the sole breadwinner for four years, and their relationship is strained because of it. She's considering not getting the gift and feels like she might be in the wrong because he's a good guy and usually asks for small things. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is struggling financially, working long hours, and her boyfriend isn't contributing financially. The main issue here is the balance of financial responsibility in the relationship. The author feels she's being unfair by not buying the expensive gift, but the broader issue is the boyfriend's lack of employment and contribution. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important, but that doesn't mean one person should bear all the financial burden. The author is clearly stressed about her debt and savings, and the boyfriend's request for a $2000 item might not be realistic given the circumstances. The boyfriend's not having a job is a significant factor here. It's not just about the gift; it's about the underlying issues of financial responsibility and partnership.\n\nThe author's resentment is valid. If one partner isn't contributing, it can lead to imbalance. The fact that she's the sole income earner and he's playing games all day (as she perceives) adds to her frustration. The question is whether she's wrong for not spending the money. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author might need to address the boyfriend's lack of employment and discuss financial expectations. However, the question is specifically about whether she's in the wrong for not getting the gift. The answer depends on whether the boyfriend's request is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nSince the author is not in a position to afford the gift and the boyfriend isn't contributing to their financial needs, her decision to prioritize her own financial stability isn't necessarily wrong. The larger issue is the boyfriend's lack of financial contribution, which the author should address, but the immediate question is about the gift. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to spend $2000 on a gift when it's causing resentment and when the boyfriend isn't supporting the relationship financially. \n\nBut wait, the user initially thought the author was wrong, so maybe considering the expectations in relationships. Some might argue that a partner should support each other's interests, but if it's causing financial strain and the partner isn't contributing, it's more about the boyfriend's responsibility. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B). However, I need to ensure that the analysis covers both sides. The author's feelings are valid, and the boyfriend's lack of employment is a problem. The author isn't wrong to prioritize her financial health and set boundaries.\n"
