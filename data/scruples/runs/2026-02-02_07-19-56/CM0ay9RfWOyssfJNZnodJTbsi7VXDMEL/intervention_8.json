He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the financial situation and the relationship dynamics. The author is the sole income provider, works 10+ hour shifts, and is trying to pay off debt and save. Her boyfriend isn't working despite saying he's looking, and she feels he's not contributing, which is causing strain. She's usually given him small items but feels pressured to spend a lot more now for his birthday.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being unfair. On one hand, she's managing the finances and has valid reasons for not wanting to spend $2000, especially when she's struggling with her own savings and debt. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the author is being stingy or not supportive, especially since he mentions he treats her well and usually asks for small things. The fact that she got him small items before but is hesitant here might be seen as inconsistency, but the price point here is much higher.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness in the relationship. The author feels like she's doing all the work while he's not contributing, which is a legitimate concern. Financial resentment can definitely strain a relationship. However, if the boyfriend is genuinely looking for a job but hasn't found one yet, maybe the author's resentment is misplaced. However, the author can't verify his job search efforts, which adds to her stress.\n\nAlso, gift-giving is a personal choice. She's not obligated to spend money on him, especially when it's causing her financial stress. The fact that she's trying to save money and pay off debt means that spending $2000 on a gift isn't responsible. Her feeling of resentment is valid because she's carrying the financial burden alone.\n\nBut maybe there's a communication issue. The author says she told him \"we'll see\" and is hitting him with that, but if she hasn't communicated her financial situation clearly, he might not understand. However, she's been saving and managing debt for a while, so she might have already discussed these issues.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, I think she's not. She's prioritizing her financial stability and her own needs. The boyfriend's request is expensive and might not be necessary given their circumstances. The author isn't being selfish in a harmful way; she's making a responsible choice. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
