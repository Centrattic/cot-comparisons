He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not buying their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. They've been together four years, and they're the sole income earner. Their boyfriend isn't working, and she feels like he's not pulling his weight, just playing games. They have financial struggles, credit card debt, and she's trying to save. The boyfriend is asking for a $2000 gift, but she feels resentful, especially since her birthday was only given a couple of books and socks. The question is whether she's the asshole for not wanting to spend that money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial situation. If she's the only one contributing income and he's not working, there's a imbalance. The boyfriend's request is expensive, which could add more stress to their already strained finances. She's trying to save and pay off debt, so spending $2000 on a gift might not be feasible or wise. \n\nOn the other hand, gifts are part of a relationship, and maybe he's not expecting her to buy it but is hoping. But she mentions he's asked before for smaller things, and she usually gives them. Now this is a big jump. She also feels like she's \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership. That implies she feels he's not contributing, which is a valid concern. \n\nIs it wrong for her to prioritize her financial health over his request? If their relationship is already strained because of his not working, maybe she's justified in not spending the money. Especially since she can't verify if he's actually looking for a job. The resentment she's feeling is a real emotion here. \n\nBut maybe she should communicate better. She's been giving him small gifts, but now this is a big ask. Maybe she should explain her financial situation to him and set boundaries. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not giving the gift. \n\nConsidering all factors, I think she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior (not working, relying on her) is problematic, and she's trying to manage their finances responsibly. So the answer is B.\n"
