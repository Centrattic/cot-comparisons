He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gaming rig for their boyfriend's birthday. The author is in a four-year relationship where they're the sole income provider. The boyfriend isn't working, and the author is struggling with financial responsibilities and debt. They feel resentful because they're covering all expenses, including the gifts, while their partner isn't contributing.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility in a relationship is a big topic. The author is working long hours and trying to save money, which is important for their financial stability. The boyfriend's request for a $2000 gift seems significant, especially if the author is already managing debt and trying to build savings. The author's feelings of resentment are valid because the financial burden isn't shared equally. \n\nThe boyfriend's lack of employment is a key factor here. If he isn't contributing financially, expecting a large gift might be unfair. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding their spending, especially when it affects their own financial goals. However, the author's response of giving minimal gifts in the past versus a larger request now could be seen as inconsistent. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014author is the sole income earner, working long hours, dealing with debt, and the boyfriend isn't contributing\u2014it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their financial needs. The $2000 request is a substantial amount, and the author isn't obligated to spend beyond their means. The resentment stems from an imbalance in the relationship's financial contributions. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they usually buy smaller items, which they can afford, but the large request is causing conflict. It's reasonable to expect that partners should contribute to shared expenses. The boyfriend's lack of employment and contribution might be the root of the problem here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend a large amount on a gift when they can't verify the boyfriend's job search efforts and when it's affecting their own financial stability. They have the right to make financial decisions that prioritize their needs and goals.\n"
