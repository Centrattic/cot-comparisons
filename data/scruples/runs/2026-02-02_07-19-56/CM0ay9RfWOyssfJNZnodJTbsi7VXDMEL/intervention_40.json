He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been together four years. The author is the sole income earner, working long hours. Her boyfriend isn't employed, and while he says he's looking for a job, she can't verify that. The relationship has been straining because she's carrying all the financial responsibility. She's saving money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. He asks for small things like games and Funko Pops, which she usually buys. But now he wants a $2000 gaming rig. She feels that she can't afford it, especially since she got much cheaper gifts for her birthday. She's resentful and doesn't want to spend the money because she feels he should get a job to afford it himself.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, relationship dynamics, and expectations. The author is struggling with providing for her own financial goals while meeting her boyfriend's desires. The boyfriend's lack of employment is a significant stressor. She's clearly communicating her inability to spend a large amount, but she's feeling bad about it, which might indicate some internal conflict.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not obligated to spend money on gifts that she can't afford, especially when there's existing financial strain. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and the author is prioritizing her financial stability and debt repayment. It's also important to consider the imbalance in their contributions to household finances. If the boyfriend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for the author to expect him to take responsibility for his expenses once he's employed.\n\nHowever, the author's resentment might be affecting the relationship. It's possible that the boyfriend feels his needs aren't being considered, but the author's perspective is valid given the financial situation. The key here is whether she's wrong for not giving the gift. Since she's making a conscious decision based on financial constraints and relationship dynamics, it's more about balancing priorities rather than being right or wrong. The author isn't being selfish; she's making a practical choice. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
