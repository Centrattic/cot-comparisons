He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on their boyfriend's birthday. The key points here are the financial situation and the underlying relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author is the sole income earner, working long hours, and has debt to pay off. They're saving money, which is understandable. The boyfriend isn't employed, and the author feels he's not pulling his weight. The boyfriend's request is for an expensive gaming rig, which the author feels is unreasonable given their circumstances. \n\nThe author has been buying smaller gifts before, but this is a significant jump in cost. They also mention that for their own birthday, they got minimal gifts, which adds to the resentment. The author is feeling like they're supporting a \"kid\" rather than a partner, which is a big deal. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big part of any relationship. If one partner can't contribute, it can lead to stress. The author isn't being selfish just for not wanting to spend money they can't afford. The boyfriend's lack of employment is a problem, and the author has a right to prioritize their financial goals. \n\nHowever, communication is key. The author might need to talk to the boyfriend about their financial limits and the expectation for him to find work. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the circumstances, the author isn't obligated to spend beyond their means, especially when it affects their savings and debt. The boyfriend's request is unreasonable given his not contributing financially. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not spending $2000 and are managing their responsibilities. The issue is more about the boyfriend's lack of contribution than the author's refusal to spend. The answer should be B.\n"
