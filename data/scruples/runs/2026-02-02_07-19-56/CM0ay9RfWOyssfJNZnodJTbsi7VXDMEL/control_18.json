He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a 4-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's the sole income earner, working 10+ hour shifts, and he doesn't have a job. She's been saving money to pay off credit card debt and build a nest egg. He's asking for a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, which she can't afford, especially since she mentioned that for her birthday she only got books and socks. She feels resentful because he's not contributing financially and is spending her money on his hobbies, which she compares to raising a kid instead of being in a partnership.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The author is the only one working, and she's struggling with her own financial goals. The boyfriend isn't contributing, which is causing tension. The $2000 gift is a significant expense for her, especially when she's trying to save. The key point here is whether she's responsible for covering his hobbies when he's not contributing to their relationship's expenses.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. She feels like an asshole for not getting the gift, but she's also feeling resentful. The boyfriend's requests for small things (like games, Funko Pops) add up, and she's had to decline. This might be part of the strain in the relationship. The question is whether not giving the expensive gift is the problem, or if the underlying issue is the imbalance in their financial responsibilities.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentions she's been saying \"we'll see, give me some time,\" which might indicate she's been delaying or avoiding the conversation. Maybe she hasn't been clear about her financial situation. However, given her long hours and the boyfriend's lack of a job, it's possible she hasn't had the chance to discuss it properly.\n\nAlso, the comparison to her own birthday where she only got books and socks might highlight the disparity in expectations. If he didn't reciprocate adequately, she might feel it's unfair to spend more on him. The author's resentment about being the sole provider could be a valid concern, as a healthy relationship should involve mutual support and contribution.\n\nIn terms of whether she's the asshole, it depends on cultural or social norms. Some might argue that not giving the gift is selfish, but others might see it as her right to prioritize her financial health, especially since her partner isn't contributing. The key is that she's trying to save money for important reasons, and the request is beyond her means.\n\nThe boyfriend's lack of a job and his spending habits could be a bigger issue here. The author might need to address this with him rather than just the gift. The act of not giving the $2000 gift is a symptom of a larger problem. So, is she wrong for not giving the gift? If she can't afford it and has communicated that, maybe not. The real issue might be the financial dynamics in the relationship.\n"
