He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gaming rig for their boyfriend's birthday. The key points here are the financial situation, the dynamics of their relationship, and the feelings of resentment.\n\nFirst, the author is the sole income provider in the household, working long hours. The boyfriend isn't employed, and while he says he's looking for a job, the author can't verify this. This creates a financial strain, especially since the author is also trying to save and pay off debt. The request for an expensive gift might be seen as unreasonable given their circumstances.\n\nThe author usually buys smaller gifts for the boyfriend, but this time it's a significant expense. The author feels the boyfriend should be working to support himself instead of relying on them. This might indicate a deeper issue about the balance of responsibility in the relationship. The author's resentment is valid because they feel they're shouldering all the financial burden, which affects their quality of life and their ability to save.\n\nThe boyfriend, on the other hand, might feel that the author isn't making an effort to meet his needs, especially since he's been a good partner otherwise. However, the author's decision to not buy the expensive gift could be a necessary boundary to protect their financial stability and their own well-being.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important, but it shouldn't come at the cost of one person's financial health. The author's hesitation isn't about being selfish but about setting realistic expectations based on their current situation. The boyfriend's job situation is a significant factor here, as relying on the partner for all expenses when unemployed can be problematic.\n\nSo, considering the financial pressures and the imbalance in responsibilities, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding not to spend the money. They're prioritizing their own needs and the relationship's long-term stability. The real issue might be the boyfriend's employment status, but that's a separate matter from the gift decision.\n"
