He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a 4-year relationship where they are the sole provider. Their boyfriend isn't working and spends time gaming. The author is struggling with financial responsibilities, including paying off debt and saving. The boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but the author can't afford it, especially since they have to manage their own needs and savings.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and the balance of contributions in a relationship. The author is clearly stressed about being the only one contributing financially. The boyfriend's request seems out of proportion given the circumstances. The author is also feeling resentful, which is valid when one partner is shouldering all financial burdens. \n\nThe author isn't refusing to give any gifts; they usually get small things. This time, the expense is much higher. The boyfriend's request might be seen as a luxury when the author is trying to save. The author's feelings of resentment towards supporting the boyfriend's gaming instead of his job search are also important. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't being cruel, just financially responsible. The boyfriend's lack of job search verification adds to the tension. The author's decision to prioritize their financial health isn't wrong. They're also considering their own needs, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability and health in a strained relationship.\n"
