He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but the author can't afford it because she's the sole income earner and they're dealing with financial strain. The boyfriend isn't working and the author feels like she's supporting him while he plays games.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibilities in the relationship. The author is working long hours, paying all the bills, and trying to save. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is causing tension. The author feels resentful because she's the only one earning money. That's a big point. She's not in the wrong for setting boundaries on spending when there are financial issues.\n\nNext, the boyfriend's request is expensive. The author usually gets him smaller gifts like games or Funko Pops, but this is a significant amount. The author is struggling to save and pay off debt. It's reasonable for her to prioritize financial stability over an expensive gift she can't afford. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling like she's raising a kid instead of being in a partnership. That's a valid feeling when one partner isn't contributing. The boyfriend's lack of employment is a key issue here. The author isn't obligated to spend money she doesn't have on him, especially when he's not contributing. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the financial strain and the boyfriend's lack of contribution, it seems the author is justified in her decision. She's managing her finances responsibly and has legitimate reasons to prioritize her own financial health. The boyfriend should be getting a job to share the burden. \n\nSo the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't being unfair by not giving an expensive gift when there are financial issues and the boyfriend isn't contributing. She's setting boundaries which are necessary in this situation.\n"
