He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend is asking for an expensive gaming rig for his birthday, but the author, who is the sole earner, can't afford it and is feeling resentful because they have financial responsibilities and the boyfriend isn't working. The author is considering not giving the expensive gift and is worried about being the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend is unemployed and the author is the sole income provider, working long hours. The relationship is strained due to financial stress. The author is trying to save money, has credit card debt, and a modest income. The boyfriend's request is for a $2000 gaming rig, but he usually gets smaller gifts. The author feels that the boyfriend should get a job to support himself, and they feel like they're not in a partnership but rather \"raising a kid.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend that much. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone is not contributing to the household financially and is asking for an expensive gift, the author's decision not to spend might be justified. The author is prioritizing their financial stability and their own well-being. The boyfriend's unemployment and lack of contribution could be a factor in the relationship's strain. The author isn't refusing to give any gift but is choosing not to spend a large amount. They usually get smaller gifts, so this is a significant jump in cost. The author's resentment is tied to the imbalance in responsibilities.\n\nHowever, in relationships, communication and mutual understanding are key. The author is using \"we'll see\" and might be pushing the boyfriend to find a job. It's possible the boyfriend might feel unappreciated or that his needs aren't being met. But if the author has communicated their financial situation and the boyfriend is aware, then the author might not be wrong. The author isn't being inconsiderate of the boyfriend's happiness but is making a practical decision based on their circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that relationships involve compromise and that the author is being selfish by not giving the gift. But given the context of financial strain and the boyfriend not contributing, it's a tough call. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their financial health and setting boundaries. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
