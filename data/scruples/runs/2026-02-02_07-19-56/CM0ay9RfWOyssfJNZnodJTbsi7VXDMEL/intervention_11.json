He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on their boyfriend's birthday. The situation is that the author is the sole income earner, working long hours, and their boyfriend isn't employed. The boyfriend wants a new gaming rig, but the author can't afford it and is struggling with their own financial goals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The author is supporting both of them and is saving money. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and the author feels it's unfair since he's not contributing. The author mentions feeling like they're raising a kid instead of being in a relationship. That's a key point. In a partnership, both should contribute, and if one is not, it's reasonable for the other to feel burdened.\n\nThe author usually buys small gifts but is now reluctant because of the financial strain. They also mention not getting a good birthday gift themselves. The boyfriend's request is significant compared to the author's own. The author's resentment is understandable given their situation.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their financial limits. They've tried to communicate (\"we'll see, give me some time\") but the boyfriend's request is beyond their means. The author's priorities are their own financial stability and paying off debt, which is responsible. The boyfriend's lack of employment is a factor here too. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their needs and the relationship's health.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
