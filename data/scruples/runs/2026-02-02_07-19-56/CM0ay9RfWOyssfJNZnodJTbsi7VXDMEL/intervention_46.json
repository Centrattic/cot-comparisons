He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but the author can't afford it because they're the sole income earner and are struggling with debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together four years, and the boyfriend isn't working, which is causing strain. The author feels like they're supporting the relationship financially while the boyfriend isn't contributing, leading to resentment. The boyfriend usually asks for small things, but this time it's a big expense. The author is saving money and can't afford to spend $2000. They also mention that the boyfriend didn't get them anything significant for their birthday, just books and socks, which the author reminded him about.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for not getting the expensive gift. On one hand, in a relationship, both partners should contribute, and if one is not earning and the other is, the financial burden shouldn't be entirely on one side. The boyfriend's lack of job might be a bigger issue here. The author is saving for debt and a nest egg, which is responsible. The $2000 is a significant amount, and the author might not be able to afford it without harming their financial goals.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a judgment about the boyfriend's job search, which they can't verify. The boyfriend might be genuinely looking for a job but hasn't found one yet. Also, the author is comparing the birthday gifts, which might not be fair. Just because the boyfriend didn't get the author an expensive gift doesn't mean the author should reciprocate with one. Relationships aren't always about equal monetary exchange.\n\nThe author's feelings of resentment are valid. Supporting someone financially without reciprocity can lead to imbalance. However, the author could communicate their financial constraints and perhaps find a middle ground, like a smaller gift or helping the boyfriend find a job. But the author is not wrong for prioritizing their financial health. They can't be expected to fund a luxury item that they can't afford, especially when it's contributing to their stress and the relationship's strain.\n\nSo considering all factors, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
