He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. The situation involves financial strain and relationship issues.\n\nFirst, the author mentions being the sole income provider, working 10+ hour shifts, and the boyfriend not having a job. The relationship has been straining because the author feels they're the only one supporting them financially. The boyfriend asks for expensive gifts like a new gaming rig, which the author can't afford. The author feels resentful and doesn't want to spend that money, especially since they have their own financial goals like debt and a nest egg.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a big deal. The author is working hard and trying to save. The boyfriend's request is a significant expense. The author has been giving small gifts before, but this is a big jump. The author's feelings of resentment and feeling like they're \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership is a key point.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, expecting a partner to cover all expenses when they're not contributing financially might be a two-way street. The author is prioritizing their own financial stability, which is understandable. The boyfriend's lack of job search verification adds to the tension. The author isn't being selfish but rather recognizing their own limits and the imbalance in the relationship. The question is about whether it's wrong not to spend the money. Since the author has valid reasons and the boyfriend's financial irresponsibility is part of the problem, the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer should be B.\n"
