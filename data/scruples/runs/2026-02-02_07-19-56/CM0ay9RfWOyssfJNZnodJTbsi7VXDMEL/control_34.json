He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gaming rig for their boyfriend's birthday. They've been together four years, and the author is the sole income provider. The boyfriend isn't working, and the relationship has been strained because of that. The author is struggling with debt and saving money, and the boyfriend's request feels like a burden.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility. The author is the only one contributing financially, which is a big deal. If the boyfriend isn't working, the author shouldn't feel obligated to cover his expenses. The $2000 gift is a significant amount for someone trying to pay off debt and save. The author's feelings of resentment are valid because the situation is unequal.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. The author has been giving small gifts but now the boyfriend is asking for something expensive. The author's hesitation to spend that much makes sense, especially since they mentioned saving for their own goals. The boyfriend might not realize the financial strain he's causing, but the author has a right to set boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author feels like they're \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership. That's a red flag in the relationship dynamics. The boyfriend should be contributing in some way, whether through work or other responsibilities, to balance the relationship. The author's frustration is justified given the imbalance.\n\nHowever, the author hasn't communicated their financial situation clearly yet. They mentioned using the \"we'll see\" response, but maybe a more direct conversation is needed. But even so, the author's primary responsibility is to their own financial stability. It's understandable they don't want to spend beyond their means, especially when the relationship is already strained.\n\nIn terms of gift-giving, it's a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to spend a lot of money just because someone asks. The value of a gift isn't the only measure of a relationship's health. The author's feelings of wanting the boyfriend to contribute more to the relationship (through work) are valid. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding not to spend $2000. They're prioritizing their financial health and addressing the imbalance in the relationship. The real issue might be deeper, like the boyfriend's lack of employment affecting the relationship's stability, but the author's choice to not spend that money is reasonable.\n"
