He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person writing the scenario is in the wrong for not getting their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together four years. The author is the sole income earner, working 10+ hour shifts. The boyfriend isn't employed, and she feels he's playing games all day. Their relationship is strained because she's the only one working. She's trying to save money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. He usually gets small gifts like games or Funko Pops, but now he wants a $2000 gaming rig. She feels resentful because she got socks and books for her birthday, which he only remembered two days before. She's considering not giving the expensive gift and is conflicted about it.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thought she is, but is unsure. Let me break it down.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor here. If she's struggling to save and has debt, spending $2000 on a non-essential item might be a problem. But relationships also involve compromise and mutual support. The boyfriend's job situation is a key point. If he's not working, maybe he should contribute in other ways, but it's unclear if he's actively looking or if there are valid reasons. The author feels like she's supporting him, which can create imbalance.\n\nGift-giving in relationships can be about effort and thoughtfulness, not just price. However, when there's a significant disparity in financial contributions, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her financial goals. The resentment she feels is valid if she's shouldering all the financial responsibility. She's also mentioned not wanting to feel like she's raising a child, implying he's not contributing equally.\n\nThe fact that he usually gets smaller gifts but now wants an expensive one might be a shift. She's within her rights to set boundaries, especially if it's causing her stress or financial strain. If the relationship is already strained due to financial imbalance, not giving the expensive gift isn't necessarily wrong; it's about her taking a stand for her priorities.\n\nBut on the other hand, not giving a gift at all might hurt him, especially if he's not aware of the financial situation. Communication is key here. If they had discussed the reasons behind her decision, maybe they could find a middle ground. However, the question is about being in the wrong for not giving the gift, not about communication. So if she's being honest about her financial constraints and prioritizing her own needs, she's not wrong. Relationships require mutual effort, and if he's not contributing, she's justified in protecting her resources.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
