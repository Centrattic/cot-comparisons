He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a girlfriend in a 4-year relationship. They have been having financial strain because she's the sole income and he's unemployed. He's asking for a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, which she can't afford, especially since she's trying to save and pay off debt. She feels resentful because she's working long hours and he's not contributing. She's been getting him smaller gifts before, but this is a big expense. She's feeling like she's not being fair to herself and is struggling with whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not giving him the expensive gift. The user initially thinks she is, but they're curious about others' opinions.\n\nLet me break this down. Financial responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky. If one partner is the sole provider, it's reasonable for them to prioritize their own financial goals, especially if there's existing debt and the need to build savings. The boyfriend's unemployment is a significant point here. If he's not contributing financially, the girlfriend might feel it's unfair to spend a large amount on him when she's already stretching her budget. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend is described as a good guy who doesn't usually ask for much. The fact that he's asking for a $2000 gift could be seen as reasonable if the couple is in a stable financial position. But given the context\u2014her financial struggles, his unemployment, and the strain on the relationship\u2014it might be seen as unreasonable. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. If she's been honest about her financial situation and they've discussed it, then her decision not to spend the money might be justified. But if she hasn't communicated her feelings and is keeping it all in, that could cause resentment on both sides. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's trying to save for debt and a nest egg shows responsibility. Prioritizing her financial health is important. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might need to take more initiative in finding a job to share the financial responsibilities. \n\nIn relationships, partners should consider each other's needs and circumstances. If the author is not in the wrong, it's because her financial stability is a priority, especially when the other partner isn't contributing. But if she hasn't addressed the underlying issues (like his unemployment) and is just focusing on the gift, then maybe there's a lack of communication. However, the question is specifically about the gift, not the overall relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong for not giving the gift. Her financial situation and the boyfriend's lack of contribution make it reasonable for her to prioritize her savings and debt over a costly gift. The real issue might be the broader financial responsibilities in the relationship, but regarding the gift itself, she's justified in her decision.\n"
