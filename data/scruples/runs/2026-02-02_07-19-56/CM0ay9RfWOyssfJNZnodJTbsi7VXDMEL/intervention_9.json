He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig as a birthday gift. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in a 4-year relationship and is the sole income provider. Her boyfriend isn't employed, spends time gaming, and the author feels he's not contributing financially. She's trying to save money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. The boyfriend asked for a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, which she can't afford. She usually buys him small gifts like games or Funko Pops but feels resentful now because she can't afford the larger expense. She's also mentioned her own birthday was met with minimal gifts, which adds to her frustration.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let me break this down. First, financial responsibilities in a relationship can be a point of contention. The author is working hard, supporting the household, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. The key issue here is whether not buying the expensive gift is wrong.\n\nFrom one angle, the boyfriend's request is significant, and the author's financial constraints are valid. She's managing her own needs and trying to save. Not fulfilling the gift request could be seen as a responsible decision given their financial situation. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or unappreciated, especially if he's been given smaller gifts in the past. The author's resentment about the financial burden and the relationship dynamic (her feeling like she's raising a child) is important context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is already strained due to financial issues and the boyfriend isn't contributing, the author's decision might be justified. She's prioritizing her financial stability, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The alternative would be to spend money she can't afford, which could lead to more debt and resentment. \n\nHowever, communication is key. If she hasn't discussed her financial situation with him and the pressures she's under, that could be a problem. But the scenario states that their relationship has been straining due to these issues, implying that communication isn't effective. She's already hit him with \"we'll see\" and is now more resentful. It's possible that the boyfriend's expectations are unrealistic given their financial situation, and the author is protecting her resources.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on financial necessity and the existing strain in the relationship. The boyfriend needs to find employment and contribute, which would help alleviate the pressure. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
