He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author is the sole income earner, and their boyfriend isn't working, playing games instead. The boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but the author can't afford it and feels resentful. They're asking if they're the asshole for not giving it to him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are financial responsibility, the boyfriend's lack of employment, the author's financial constraints, and relationship dynamics. The author is working long hours, saving to pay off debt and build a nest egg. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially and is asking for expensive gifts. The author feels they're being taken advantage of, like they're raising a kid instead of being in a partnership.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support and shared responsibilities are important. If one partner isn't contributing financially, especially when it's causing strain, it's reasonable for the other to feel burdened. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend a significant amount when they're already struggling. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and the author can't verify his job search, which adds to the tension.\n\nFinancial decisions in relationships often involve prioritizing personal needs and responsibilities. The author is prioritizing their financial stability and paying off debt, which is a responsible move. The boyfriend's expectation of a costly gift might not consider the author's financial reality. The resentment the author feels is valid given the circumstances. They're also setting boundaries by not fulfilling the request, which is a healthy approach if the relationship is unbalanced.\n\nHowever, communication is key. The author has mentioned their financial constraints (\"we'll see,\" \"give me time\"), which is important. The boyfriend's reaction or lack of understanding could also play a role. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author is the sole provider and the boyfriend isn't contributing, the author isn't being selfish by not spending money they can't afford. It's about sustainability and fairness in the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're managing their finances responsibly and addressing the imbalance in the relationship.\n"
