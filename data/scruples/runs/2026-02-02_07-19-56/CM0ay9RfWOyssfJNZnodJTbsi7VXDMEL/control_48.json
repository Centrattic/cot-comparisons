He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: They've been together four years, the author is the sole income earner, working long hours, and the boyfriend isn't working despite saying he's looking. The author is saving money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. The boyfriend usually gets smaller gifts like games or Funko Pops, but this time he wants a big expense. The author feels resentful because they can't afford it and are tired of being the only one supporting financially. They also mention feeling like they're raising a kid instead of being in a partnership.\n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is about financial responsibility in a relationship. The author is prioritizing their own financial goals and well-being. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and the author can't verify if he's actually seeking employment. The author has given smaller gifts before but is now setting a boundary due to financial strain.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider mutual respect and communication. The author isn't refusing just out of stinginess but because of genuine financial constraints and dissatisfaction with the relationship's balance. The boyfriend might feel disappointed if he expected the gift, but the author isn't obligated to spend beyond their means, especially when there are underlying issues like employment and financial responsibility.\n\nThe author is also trying to communicate their situation by saying \"we'll see,\" which shows they're trying to manage expectations. The resentment comes from a place of stress and imbalance in the relationship. The key here is whether it's fair to expect one partner to cover all expenses, especially when there's a significant disparity in financial contribution. Since the author is the sole earner and the boyfriend isn't contributing, the author's decision to prioritize their own financial stability isn't necessarily wrong. They're setting a boundary to protect their own well-being, which is important in any relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their circumstances and the need for balance in the relationship.\n"
