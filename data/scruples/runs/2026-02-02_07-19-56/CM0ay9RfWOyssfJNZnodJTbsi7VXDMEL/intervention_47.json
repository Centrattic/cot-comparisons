He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. They've been together four years, are the sole income provider, and he doesn't have a job. The user is feeling resentful because they're working long hours and he's not contributing financially. They usually buy him small gifts but now are struggling with a big expense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibility in a relationship. If one partner is the sole provider, it's reasonable for them to prioritize their financial goals, like paying off debt or saving. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and if he's not contributing financially, the author might feel it's unfair to spend that much. The author also mentions feeling like they're \"raising a kid,\" implying a lack of mutual support.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend does treat them well and asks for modest things usually. The author might be overstepping if they're not communicating their financial constraints. But the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not giving the gift. Since the boyfriend's job situation is a strain on the relationship, the author has valid reasons to prioritize their financial health. Not giving the gift isn't being in the wrong; it's about setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
