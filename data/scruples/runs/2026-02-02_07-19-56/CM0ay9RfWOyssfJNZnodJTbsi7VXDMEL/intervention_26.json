He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on her boyfriend's birthday gift. The author is in a four-year relationship where she's the sole income earner, working long hours, and he's unemployed. She's struggling with debt and saving money, but he keeps asking for small gifts and now a big gaming rig.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is asking for a significant amount of money, which the author can't really afford. She's already stretched thin with her own financial responsibilities. On the other hand, he's mentioned that he's looking for a job, but she can't verify that. Maybe he's not making an effort, which adds to her resentment.\n\nThe author feels she's doing all the work, both financially and in the relationship. She's trying to save, and the boyfriend's requests are adding to her financial stress. She also points out that for her birthday, she got socks and books, which he might not have prioritized. That could indicate a lack of reciprocity in gift-giving, which is a point in her favor.\n\nBut then, is it fair for her to not give the gift? Some might say that in a relationship, partners should be considerate of each other's financial situations. However, if one person is the sole provider and the other isn't contributing, it's understandable that the provider might feel exploited. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable by not giving the gift when she's already under financial strain.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is trying to save for debt and a nest egg shows responsibility. The boyfriend's request is for a $2000 item, which could be impractical given her circumstances. She's already given smaller gifts, but this is a big jump. The author's resentment comes from feeling like she's shouldering everything, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut maybe the author could have communicated better. She mentioned saying \"we'll see, give me some time,\" but as the date approaches, she's more resentful. Perhaps she should have had a more direct conversation about her financial limits and the need for the boyfriend to find a job. However, given her workload and his unemployment, it's possible that he isn't making the effort, making her refusal justified.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, if one partner isn't contributing to the household, the other might feel like they're in a parent-child role rather than a partnership. The author's frustration stems from that imbalance. The question is whether her decision not to spend the money is selfish or necessary for her financial health.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's prioritizing her financial stability and addressing an imbalance in the relationship. However, there's a need for better communication and mutual effort from both partners. The boyfriend's unemployment and high expectations without contribution could be the real issue here, so the author isn't at fault for refusing the expensive gift.\n"
