He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not getting their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The author is the sole provider, their boyfriend isn't working, and there's financial strain and resentment involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is working long hours, has debt to pay off, and is saving money. The boyfriend's request is a $2000 item, which is a significant expense, especially if the author is already managing their own finances carefully. The author feels they've been supporting the relationship financially while the boyfriend isn't contributing. \n\nThe boyfriend, on the other hand, might see the game as a small request, especially if he's not earning an income. But the author's perspective is valid too. They might feel that the boyfriend isn't pulling his weight, leading to the relationship feeling imbalanced. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author is being honest about their financial situation, which is important. They've already made sacrifices, like giving smaller gifts in the past, but this time the request is much bigger. The author's hesitation is understandable given their stress and the boyfriend's lack of employment. \n\nI should also consider if there's been a discussion about the gaming rig. The author mentions saying \"we'll see\" and not following through, which might have caused frustration. However, the underlying issue seems to be about the boyfriend's contribution to the relationship versus taking. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether they have an obligation to spend beyond their means. Since they're the sole earner and have financial goals, it's reasonable for them to prioritize those. The boyfriend's needs to contribute to his own expenses, especially if he's not working. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend a large amount on a birthday gift when there's already financial strain and the boyfriend isn't contributing. The main issue is the imbalance in the relationship, not the specific decision about the gift. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
