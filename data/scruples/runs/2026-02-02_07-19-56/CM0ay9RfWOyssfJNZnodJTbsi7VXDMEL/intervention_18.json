He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is in a four-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's the sole income provider, working 10+ hour shifts. He's unemployed, and she feels he's just playing games all day. Their relationship has been straining because of this. She's trying to save money for debt and a nest egg, but her income isn't high.\n\nThe boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, which she feels she can't afford. She usually gets him small gifts like games or Funko Pops, and for her birthday, she got books and socks. The author is conflicted because she feels resentful about spending a lot on him when she's struggling financially and he's not contributing. She's also worried about feeling like she's raising a kid instead of being in a partnership.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not giving him the expensive gift. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend is asking for a costly item when he's not contributing financially. The author is the sole earner, and she's already stretched thin. She's also trying to save, which is responsible. It's reasonable for her to prioritize her financial goals and her own needs. On the other hand, she does usually give him small gifts, and maybe he expects a significant gift this time. However, the main issue is the financial strain and the imbalance in their relationship dynamics.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's lack of employment. If he's not working, he can't contribute to shared expenses or his own gifts. The author might feel that he should be responsible for his own expenses, especially if he's not working. The feeling of resentment is valid because she's carrying the financial burden alone, which can affect the relationship's health.\n\nI think the key points here are about financial responsibility and relationship balance. The author has a right to prioritize her finances, especially when she's the sole provider. She's also in a position where she's working long hours, which leaves her with less time and energy. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries. The boyfriend might need to take responsibility for his situation by finding a job, which would help alleviate the pressure on her. So, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding not to spend the money on a gift she can't afford, especially given the existing strains in their relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
