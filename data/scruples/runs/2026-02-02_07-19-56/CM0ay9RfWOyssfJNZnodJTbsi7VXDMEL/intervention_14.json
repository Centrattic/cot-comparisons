He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. The author is the sole income provider, the boyfriend isn't working, and there's financial strain and resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is working long hours, managing debt, and saving. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially. The author feels like they're supporting a child instead of a partner. The gift in question is expensive, and the author is struggling financially. The boyfriend has asked for small things before, but this is a big expense. \n\nThe author's feelings of resentment are valid because they're shouldering all the financial responsibility. The boyfriend's lack of job and contribution could be a bigger issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial goals and self-care. The question is whether not spending on the gift makes them an asshole. Considering the circumstances, the author is justified in their decision. The key points are financial responsibility, mutual contribution in a relationship, and the author's own needs. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
