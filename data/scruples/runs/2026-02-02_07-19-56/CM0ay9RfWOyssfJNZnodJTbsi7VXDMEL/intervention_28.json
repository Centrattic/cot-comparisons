He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the author should give their boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. The author is the sole income earner, and the boyfriend isn't working, which is causing strain. The author feels resentful because they can't afford it and are managing debt, while the boyfriend asks for expensive gifts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is working long hours, supporting the household, and has financial responsibilities. The boyfriend isn't employed, which the author is frustrated about. The author usually gets the small things he asks for but is now facing a large expense. The key points are financial responsibility, mutual effort in a relationship, and communication.\n\nThe author might feel they're being unfair by not giving the gift, especially if the boyfriend isn't working. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel unappreciated if the author doesn't give the gift he wants. But the author's resentment comes from the fact that they're shouldering all financial burdens. It's about whether the author is justified in not spending on an expensive gift when there are financial strains and the boyfriend isn't contributing.\n\nThe author is also comparing their own birthday gifts, which were much cheaper. That might highlight the discrepancy. Relationships require mutual support, but both partners should contribute. If the boyfriend isn't working, maybe he's not contributing enough, leading to the author's feelings of being in a parent-child dynamic instead of a partnership.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author has a valid reason to be concerned about their financial situation. They're not being selfish for wanting to prioritize their debt and savings. However, communication is key. If the author hasn't discussed their financial limits with the boyfriend, it might come off as a surprise, causing hurt feelings. But given the context, the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong. They're making a choice based on their financial reality and the imbalance in their relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
