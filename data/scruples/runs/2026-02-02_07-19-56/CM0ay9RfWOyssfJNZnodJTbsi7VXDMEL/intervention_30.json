He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The situation is that they've been together four years, the author is the sole income earner with long hours, the boyfriend isn't working and seems to be playing games all day. The author is struggling with debt and saving, and feels resentful about supporting the boyfriend financially while he doesn't contribute. The boyfriend asked for a $2000 item, which the author can't afford, and the author is considering not getting it and even small gifts now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is working hard, has financial responsibilities, and is trying to save. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the household income, which is causing strain. The author feels like they're \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership. On the other hand, the boyfriend is asking for gifts that the author can't afford, which adds to the stress.\n\nThe key points are financial responsibility and relationship expectations. In a healthy relationship, both partners should contribute, whether emotionally, financially, or in other ways. If one person is shouldering all the responsibilities, it can lead to resentment. The author is concerned about their financial stability and debt, which is valid. The $2000 gaming rig is a significant expense that might not be feasible when the author is already struggling to save.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's lack of employment is a factor here. If he's not contributing financially, it's reasonable for the author to question the balance in the relationship. The author's feelings of resentment are justified because they're carrying the financial burden alone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their financial needs over the boyfriend's desires. \n\nIn this context, the author isn't being selfish; they're making a necessary choice based on their circumstances. The boyfriend's expectations might not align with the reality of their financial situation. The author is also trying to communicate this by saying \"we'll see,\" which shows they're trying to be honest but are facing internal conflict.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend beyond their means. The real issue might be deeper\u2014like the boyfriend's lack of contribution to the relationship. The author's decision to prioritize their financial health is reasonable, especially when the relationship dynamics are already strained. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
