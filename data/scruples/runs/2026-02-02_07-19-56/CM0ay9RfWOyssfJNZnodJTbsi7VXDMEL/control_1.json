He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's okay not to buy their boyfriend an expensive birthday gift when they can't afford it and are the sole provider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is the only income provider, working long hours. The boyfriend isn't working and the author feels he's not contributing, which is causing strain. The requested gift is $2000, which is a lot. The author feels resentful because they can't afford it and have their own financial goals like paying off debt. They usually buy smaller gifts but feel this is too much.\n\nThe main question is if the author is wrong for not giving the expensive gift. From a financial responsibility standpoint, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their own financial health. They mentioned their own birthday received small gifts, so expecting a $2000 gift might be imbalanced. The boyfriend's employment status is a point of tension too. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to manage their money wisely. \n\nAlso, communication is key. The author has been saying \"we'll see\" and feels resentful. That indicates they might be struggling to communicate their financial limits. But the core issue is whether they're wrong for not giving. Since the gift is beyond their means and the relationship dynamics are strained, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to take responsibility for his job situation, which could affect their finances. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (Not the asshole) because the author is managing their finances responsibly given their circumstances and the relationship stress.\n"
