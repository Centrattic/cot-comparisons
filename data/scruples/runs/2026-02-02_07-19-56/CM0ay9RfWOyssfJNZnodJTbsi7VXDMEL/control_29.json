He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is considering whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on their boyfriend's birthday gift. The key points here are their financial situation and the relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, they mention being the sole income provider, working long hours, and dealing with debt. Their boyfriend isn't employed, and they feel he's not contributing. The author is saving money for their own financial stability, which is understandable. The boyfriend wants an expensive gaming rig, but the author feels resentful, especially since their own birthday was met with cheaper gifts. \n\nThe author's main concern is fairness and sustainability. They\u2019re not just being cheap; they\u2019re dealing with real financial stress and a strained relationship. The boyfriend's lack of employment and the author's feeling of \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership adds context. The question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize their financial health and emotional well-being over a costly gift.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support and contribution are important. If one partner is bearing all the financial burden without reciprocation, it's a valid concern. The author is not refusing to give all gifts but is frustrated with the imbalance. They\u2019re also feeling resentful, which can be a sign of deeper issues. The boyfriend's request seems excessive given the circumstances. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're setting boundaries. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
