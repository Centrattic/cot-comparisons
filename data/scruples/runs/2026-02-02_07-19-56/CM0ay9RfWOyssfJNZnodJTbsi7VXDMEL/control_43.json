He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a girlfriend who's been with her boyfriend for four years. She's the sole income earner, working 10+ hour shifts. He's not employed, and she feels he's not looking hard enough. Their relationship is strained because she's the only one supporting them financially. She's saving money to pay off debt and build a nest egg, but he's asking for an expensive gaming rig for his birthday, around $2000. She's conflicted because she usually gets him smaller gifts but can't afford this. She feels resentful and doesn't want to give him the expensive gift, thinking he should get a job instead. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Financial contributions in a relationship can be a big deal, especially when one person is the sole provider. The author is working long hours and feels her partner isn't contributing, which is causing stress. She's being responsible with her money, saving for debt and a nest egg. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and she feels it's unreasonable given his lack of financial contribution. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is asking for a gift that's significant in cost. The author mentions he usually asks for small things and she gets them, so maybe he's not unreasonable in the past. But this time it's a big expense. She's also trying to set boundaries now, which is understandable. However, is it unfair to not give the gift? \n\nThe key points are: the author's financial responsibility, the boyfriend's lack of employment, and the emotional strain. She's trying to prioritize her financial stability over a gift. The question is whether this makes her the asshole. \n\nIn many cases, people might feel that a partner should consider each other's financial situations. If she can't afford the gift without compromising her own goals, it's reasonable for her to say no. However, if the relationship expects gift-giving despite financial strain, she might be seen as not contributing to the relationship's joy. But given the context of her being the sole provider and the boyfriend's lack of effort, it's a complex situation. \n\nThe author's resentment is also a factor. She feels like she's \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership. She's justified in wanting her partner to contribute, especially financially. The gift is a symbol of that imbalance. So not giving it isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's request might be seen as selfish if he's not contributing. The author is prioritizing her own financial health and pushing for her partner to take responsibility. That seems reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
