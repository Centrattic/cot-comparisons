He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on their boyfriend's birthday gift. The situation is that the author is the sole income earner, working long hours, and the boyfriend isn't employed. The author is struggling with debt and savings, while the boyfriend wants an expensive gaming rig. The author feels resentful because they have to cover everything, and they compare their own birthday gift (books and socks) to what they're being asked to spend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Typically, gifts are part of gestures of love and appreciation, but they shouldn't be a source of financial strain, especially if it's causing resentment. The author is in a difficult position where they're supporting both their needs and the boyfriend's, which is unfair if the boyfriend isn't contributing. Financially, asking for a $2000 item when the author is saving and in debt might be unreasonable. However, relationships also involve mutual respect and communication. The author might feel they're being asked to support someone who isn't pulling their weight, which is a valid concern. But is it wrong to say no to the gift? Maybe not, especially if it's causing resentment. The key factors are communication, financial responsibility, and mutual support. The boyfriend's lack of employment and the author's financial stress are significant. The author's feelings of resentment are justified if the boyfriend isn't contributing. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're prioritizing their financial health and addressing an imbalance in the relationship.\n"
