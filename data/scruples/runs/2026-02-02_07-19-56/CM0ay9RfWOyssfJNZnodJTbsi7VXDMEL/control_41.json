He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. They've been together for four years, and she's the sole income earner. He doesn't have a job, and she's been working long hours. She's tried to save money but feels strained financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The author is managing her own credit card debt and trying to build a nest egg. The gaming rig is $2000, which is a significant expense. If she's the only one contributing to the household, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her financial goals. She mentions that he doesn't have a job and she can't verify his job search efforts, which adds to her stress.\n\nThe boyfriend's requests for small things like games and Funko Pops are manageable, but the expensive gift is beyond her capacity. She's also been getting him small gifts, showing she's made efforts. The key issue here is the balance between maintaining the relationship and her financial responsibilities.\n\nThe author feels resentful because she's the sole provider. It's important to note that in a relationship, both parties should contribute. If he's not earning an income, it's fair for her to question the sustainability of the relationship. Her feelings of resentment are valid, especially when she's working long hours and he's not contributing.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not giving the expensive gift. From a financial responsibility standpoint, she's not obligated to spend beyond her means. The relationship dynamics also play a role here. If the boyfriend isn't meeting his responsibilities, the author has the right to prioritize her needs.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's justified in her decision given the financial strain and the relationship's current state. The boyfriend's lack of contribution is a significant factor here, and she's within her rights to set boundaries.\n"
