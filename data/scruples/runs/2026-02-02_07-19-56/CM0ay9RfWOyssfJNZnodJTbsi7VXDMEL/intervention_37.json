He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. The author can't afford it because they're the sole provider, dealing with long hours and debt. The boyfriend isn't working, and the author feels resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial situation. The author is the only income earner, working 10+ hours a day. The boyfriend isn't employed, and the author can't verify if he's actually looking for work. The author is saving money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. Spending $2000 on a gaming rig might be a significant burden here.\n\nThen, the relationship dynamics. The author mentions the relationship has been straining because of the financial imbalance. The boyfriend is described as a good guy who doesn't usually ask for much, but the gaming rig is expensive. The author feels like they're supporting a child rather than a partner, which is a big concern.\n\nThe author is also feeling resentful and not wanting to buy even small things. This suggests that the underlying issue is more about the boyfriend's lack of contribution and the author's financial stress. The key question is whether not buying the expensive gift makes the author the \"asshole.\"\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the boyfriend can't work and isn't contributing, expecting the author to cover such expenses might be unfair. The author has their own financial goals and responsibilities. The boyfriend's request might not be unreasonable on the surface, but the context of his lack of employment and the author's financial situation complicates it.\n\nIt's important to note that the author is honest about their feelings and is trying to communicate boundaries. They're not being stingy just for the sake of it but are dealing with real financial constraints and relationship stress. The boyfriend's expectations might be unrealistic given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a difficult decision based on their financial limitations and the imbalance in the relationship. The boyfriend might need to take responsibility for his employment situation rather than expecting expensive gifts. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
