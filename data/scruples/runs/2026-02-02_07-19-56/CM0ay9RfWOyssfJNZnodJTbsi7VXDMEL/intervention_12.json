He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" question is in the wrong for not getting her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig as a birthday gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for four years, and the author is the sole income earner. Her boyfriend isn't working, and she's working long hours. The relationship has been strained because of this. The author is trying to save money to pay off debt and build a nest egg. The boyfriend usually asks for small gifts like games or Funko Pops, which she usually gets, but this time he's asking for a $2000 gaming rig. She feels resentful because she's the only one working and doesn't want to spend that much, especially when her own birthday gifts were minimal. She's also feeling like she's \"raising a kid\" instead of being in a partnership.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key points here are financial responsibility, the boyfriend's situation, and mutual expectations in a relationship.\n\nThe author is managing her finances responsibly by saving and paying off debt. She's the sole provider, which adds to her stress. The boyfriend's request is expensive, and she's not in a position to afford it without compromising her financial goals. She's also communicated her situation to him by saying \"we'll see, give me some time,\" which shows she's trying to be honest. Her resentment is understandable given the imbalance in their situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or unappreciated if he's not getting the gift he wanted. However, the author isn't being unreasonable by not fulfilling an expensive request when it's causing her financial strain. Relationships require compromise, and she's trying to balance her needs with his. The fact that she usually gets him smaller gifts shows she's invested in the relationship, but this particular request is beyond her current capacity.\n\nThe bigger issue might be the boyfriend's lack of employment and the imbalance in their contributions. The author's frustration is valid, and she's justified in wanting her partner to contribute more. However, the question is about the specific act of not giving the expensive gift. Since she's being honest about her financial constraints and has communicated her feelings, she's not the asshole here. The problem lies more in the overall dynamic of their relationship rather than the single decision about a gift.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
