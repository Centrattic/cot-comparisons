He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to buy their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The situation involves financial strain, job responsibilities, and relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author is the sole income provider, working long hours. The boyfriend isn't employed, which adds to the strain. The author feels like they're supporting someone who isn't contributing financially. The boyfriend has been asking for small gifts, which the author usually gets, but the $2000 rig is a big jump. The author also mentions they gave minimal gifts for their own birthday, which might make the request feel unfair.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mutual contribution in a relationship. The author is struggling with debt and saving, which is a valid concern. Expecting them to spend a large sum on a gift when they're already stretched thin could be unreasonable. The boyfriend's lack of a job might be a bigger issue, as financial contributions are part of a healthy relationship, especially when one partner is supporting the other.\n\nThe author's resentment is understandable. They're working hard and might feel like they're doing more than their fair share. The fact that the boyfriend's request is for a luxury item when the author is managing their own budget issues adds to the tension. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their financial stability. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel unappreciated, but the author's reasons are valid. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to spend. Considering the circumstances, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They have a right to manage their finances responsibly. The real issue might be the boyfriend not contributing financially, which the author has a right to address. So the answer is B.\n"
