He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving their boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. The key points here are the financial situation, the relationship dynamics, and the emotional aspects.\n\nFirst, the author is the sole income provider, working long hours, and has been saving to pay off debt. The boyfriend isn't employed and the author can't verify his job search. This creates financial strain, which is a valid concern. The author feels resentful because they're shouldering all the financial responsibility while the partner isn't contributing. That's a common issue in relationships where one partner isn't earning an income, leading to imbalance.\n\nThe boyfriend is asking for a $2000 gaming rig as a birthday gift. The author is considering not getting it, even the smaller gifts, which makes the author feel guilty. The author also mentions that for their own birthday, they got simple items and had to remind the partner. This seems unfair, as the author is giving more than they're receiving.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship often involve shared goals and mutual contributions. If one partner isn't contributing, it can lead to resentment. The author's hesitation to spend on the expensive gift is understandable given their financial constraints and the stress of being the sole provider. They also express feeling like they're \"raising a kid,\" which indicates a lack of partnership in the relationship.\n\nHowever, relationships also require compromise and communication. The author hasn't had an open conversation about their financial situation and expectations. Simply withholding gifts without discussing the underlying issues might not address the root problems. The boyfriend might not be aware of the extent of the financial strain or the author's feelings about the imbalance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's decision is based on financial limitations and a desire for a more balanced relationship. The boyfriend's request is for a luxury item that's a significant expense, which the author can't afford without exacerbating their debt. In that context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their financial health over an expensive gift. But the lack of communication is a problem. The author should express their feelings and perhaps discuss the need for the boyfriend to contribute, whether through employment or other means.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for not spending beyond their means, but the situation highlights the need for better communication and mutual effort in the relationship. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
