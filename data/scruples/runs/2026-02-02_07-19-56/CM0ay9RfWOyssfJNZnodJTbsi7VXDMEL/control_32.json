He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday. The context is that they've been together 4 years, she's the sole income provider, he's unemployed despite claiming to be job hunting, and there's been financial strain and resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial situation. She's the only one earning, working long hours, and saving to pay off debt. He's asking for an expensive gift. She feels it's unfair when she got cheaper gifts for her birthday. The key points here are financial responsibility and mutual contribution in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should ideally contribute to shared expenses. If one partner isn't contributing financially, especially when there's a significant expense, it can create imbalance. The boyfriend isn't working, so he's not contributing to the household. The author is struggling with her own financial goals, which is reasonable.\n\nThe question is about whether she's wrong for not buying the expensive gift. From a fairness standpoint, she's not obligated to fund his hobbies, especially when he's not contributing. The resentment she feels is valid given the circumstances. The boyfriend's request is understandable, but the author's financial priorities are also important.\n\nSocial norms around gift-giving suggest that while thoughtful gifts are nice, they shouldn't cause financial strain. The author isn't refusing out of spite but due to financial constraints and the imbalance in their situation. She's also considering the relationship's future health, which is crucial.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should compromise or find a cheaper alternative. But she's already cutting back on smaller gifts, and the $2000 request is a huge leap from past gifts. The boyfriend's lack of job activity could be a red flag she's addressing.\n\nSo, the author's decision is about maintaining her financial stability and addressing the relationship's imbalance. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
