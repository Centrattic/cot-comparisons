He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a 4-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's the sole provider, working 10+ hour shifts, and he doesn't have a job. She's been saving money for debt and a nest egg. He wants a $2000 gaming rig for his birthday, but she feels resentful because she can't afford it, especially since he's not contributing financially. She's also mentioned that he asks for small things like games and Funko Pops which she usually gets, but this is a bigger ask. She's feeling like she's doing all the work and he's not helping. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibility in a relationship. If one partner is the sole breadwinner and the other isn't contributing, it can lead to stress. The author is struggling with balancing her savings goals and her partner's requests. The key points here are financial strain, unequal contribution, and the emotional toll of feeling like she's \"raising a kid.\"\n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on his birthday. On one hand, she's in a tough spot financially and might not have the means. On the other hand, she's been giving him smaller gifts, so maybe there's an expectation of reciprocity. But given the context of him not working and the financial pressure she's under, maybe it's reasonable for her to say no. \n\nAlso, the resentment she's feeling is valid because the imbalance in their contributions is causing strain. She might be within her rights to prioritize her financial goals and her own well-being. The fact that she's tried to communicate (\"we'll see, give me some time\") shows she's trying to be considerate, but the underlying issue is the financial disparity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (she's not in the wrong) because she's making a responsible choice given their financial situation and the lack of contribution from her partner. The problem here isn't just about the gift but the larger issues in their relationship dynamic.\n"
