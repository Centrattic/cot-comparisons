He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not getting her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig he wants for his birthday. The situation involves financial strain and relationship issues.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've been together four years, and she's the sole income. He's unemployed and she can't verify if he's actually looking for work. She works long hours and is struggling with debt. The boyfriend's request is a $2000 gaming rig, while she's only able to get small, inexpensive gifts. She feels resentful because she's the one supporting them financially and he's not contributing.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and relationship balance. The author is clearly under financial pressure. If she can't afford the $2000 item, she's not obligated to spend money she doesn't have. The boyfriend's unemployment is a point of contention; if he's not contributing to household expenses, expecting a large gift might be unreasonable. \n\nThe author mentions previous small gifts, which she's been providing. However, this is asking for a significant expense. The emotional aspect is important too\u2014she feels like she's raising a kid instead of being in a partnership. That's a valid feeling, especially if the boyfriend isn't pulling his weight in terms of work.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer would hinge on whether she's at fault for prioritizing her financial stability over his request. If she can't afford it, she's not in the wrong for not spending. However, if there's a pattern of her sacrificing too much without addressing the employment issue, that might be a different angle. But based on the information given, the author's financial constraints and the boyfriend's lack of contribution suggest she's not in the wrong.\n"
