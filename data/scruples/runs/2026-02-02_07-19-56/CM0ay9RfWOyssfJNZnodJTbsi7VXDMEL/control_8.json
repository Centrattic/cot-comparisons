He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. \n\nHe's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig. I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks. I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again. I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the main issue is whether the author is justified in not giving her boyfriend an expensive gaming rig for his birthday. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together four years. The author is the sole income provider, working long hours. Her boyfriend is unemployed, and she can't verify if he's actually looking for a job. They've been experiencing relationship strain because of the financial burden. The boyfriend asks for small gifts usually, which she provides, but now he wants a $2000 gaming rig. The author feels resentful because she's struggling to save money, pay off debt, and can't afford such an expensive gift. She also mentions that her birthday was met with only socks and books, which she had to remind him about.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clearly under financial stress. It's not like she's being cheap; she's trying to manage her money responsibly. The boyfriend's unemployment is a point of contention. If he's not contributing financially, asking for a $2000 gift might be unreasonable. The author feels like she's supporting a child rather than a partner, which is a valid concern. Relationships typically require mutual support, and if one person isn't pulling their weight, it can create resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is asking for a birthday gift. Even though he's unemployed, it's his birthday. But the key here is the amount. $2000 is a significant expense, especially when the author is already struggling with her own financial goals. She's been saving, has debt to pay off, and needs a nest egg. Spending $2000 on a gaming rig might not align with her financial priorities.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to give any gift, just the expensive one. The previous small gifts she gives are manageable, but this is a big jump. It's about financial responsibility versus the expectation of gift-giving. Also, the boyfriend's behavior of not working might be contributing to the problem. If he's not contributing, expecting an expensive gift could be seen as unfair.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author is trying to communicate her financial limits and has been using \"we'll see\" as an excuse. Her resentment is growing because the situation isn't being addressed. It's possible that the boyfriend isn't aware of the financial strain or the reasons behind her hesitation. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's being honest about her situation and the gift is beyond her means, then she's not in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the comparison to her own birthday where she received socks and books (which she had mentioned) might highlight the imbalance. If she gave herself a modest gift, expecting someone else to have a modest one makes sense. The boyfriend's request seems out of proportion given the circumstances.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to spend $2000 on a gift when she's already under financial stress and the relationship is strained due to financial issues. She's making a responsible choice for her situation. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
