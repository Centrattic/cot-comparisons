Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The boyfriend, who is 24, has been open about his past trauma. The author felt her image of him changed, leading to discomfort and attraction issues. She left his apartment during an emotional moment but hasn't broken up yet. Her best friend suggests staying, but she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which is a big deal. The author's reaction is a mix of empathy and personal conflict. She feels weird seeing him text her now, her attraction has waned, and she's unsure if she can see him the same way. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, people have different reactions to such revelations. While it's important to support a partner through trauma, it's also valid if someone can't reconcile that with their feelings. However, walking away immediately after learning about such a significant trauma might be seen as insensitive. But the author does mention she tried to comfort him. \n\nOn the other hand, it's her right to feel how she does. Not everyone can handle a partner's trauma in the same way. But the key is whether her reaction was dismissive or judgmental. The post says she feels uncomfortable, not that she blamed him or was cruel. \n\nThe AITA community often looks at intent and compassion. If the author's reaction was genuine and not malicious, maybe she's not the asshole. But she might still be expected to communicate better and give it time. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her feelings are valid, even if the relationship might not work out. It's a personal choice, not necessarily a moral failing.\n"
