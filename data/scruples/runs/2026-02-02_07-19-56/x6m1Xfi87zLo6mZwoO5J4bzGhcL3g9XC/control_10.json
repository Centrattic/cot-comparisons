Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nThe person is a 20-year-old woman in a 5-month relationship with her 24-year-old boyfriend. He started having trouble performing sexually, and when she asked, he broke down and told her he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. The woman felt her image of him shattered because he seemed so macho before. She comforted him but then left and hasn't been the same since. She's now considering breaking up, and her best friend thinks she should give it time, but she's not as attracted to him anymore.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's think about the situation. The boyfriend has a traumatic past that's affecting him now. He was vulnerable and shared something deeply personal. The woman is struggling with her feelings after this revelation. She's not sure if she can see him the same way again, feels weird when he texts, and her attraction has diminished. She hasn't broken up yet but is considering it.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, the key factors here are understanding and support in a relationship. When someone shares such a sensitive issue, especially one that's causing them emotional distress, the partner's reaction is important. The woman did comfort him initially but then distanced herself. She's now struggling with attraction and considering ending the relationship.\n\nOn one hand, she might be reacting to the shock of learning something that changed her perception of him. It's possible she's experiencing confusion or even some internal bias, though she's not the perpetrator. On the other hand, her reaction could be seen as insensitive because he's in a vulnerable state. Ending the relationship over this might be considered harsh, but it's also a personal decision based on her feelings.\n\nHowever, the question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, both partners have the right to their feelings. If she's genuinely not able to support him or feels repulsed, she might not be in the wrong for wanting to end it. But if she's distancing without trying to understand or support him, that could be seen as wrong. The fact that she left after he was emotional might suggest she didn't handle it well, but it's also a moment of shock.\n\nThe answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because everyone has the right to their feelings and comfort. However, some might argue that she should give it more time and not let his past affect her attraction so much. It's a complex situation where both perspectives have validity. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and her feelings are genuine, the answer might be B. But I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
