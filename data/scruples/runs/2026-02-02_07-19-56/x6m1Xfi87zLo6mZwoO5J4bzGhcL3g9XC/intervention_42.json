Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after her boyfriend admitted he was raped. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend is a 24-year-old man who's been in a 5-month relationship with a 20-year-old woman. He's described as dominant, muscular, and someone who seems \"tough.\" Recently, he started having trouble performing sexually, which led to him breaking down and revealing he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. The woman felt her image of him shattered and is now distancing herself. She's unsure if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this. Let's consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend's trauma could significantly impact his mental health and sexual performance. The woman's reaction is understandable because it challenges her perception of him. However, she's responding by considering breaking up, which might not consider his emotional state.\n\nIn relationships, when a partner shares such a trauma, it's crucial to offer support. The woman's immediate reaction is to distance herself. While it's okay to feel shocked or confused, acting on those feelings by ending the relationship might be premature. She's not wrong for feeling differently, but the way she's handling it could be inconsiderate. She should probably engage in open communication with him, perhaps seek couples' counseling, or take time to process her feelings before making a decision. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not inconsiderate and is being honest with her feelings, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's dismissing his trauma and not making an effort, then she might be. It's a tricky balance. I think the key is whether she's being supportive or just reacting negatively. Since she's feeling weird and not attracted but hasn't communicated effectively, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but her approach could use improvement. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that she should handle it more thoughtfully.\n"
