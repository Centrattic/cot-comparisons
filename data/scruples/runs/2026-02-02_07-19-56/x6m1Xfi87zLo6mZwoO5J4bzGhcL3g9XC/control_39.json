Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the given situation is at fault. The scenario is that the user's boyfriend admitted he was raped as a child, which made the user feel weird and consider distancing themselves. The question is whether the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider the emotional impact of such a confession. The boyfriend was raped at 11 by his stepbrother, which is a serious and traumatic experience. The user mentions that their image of him as a \"macho\" or \"tough guy\" was shattered. That's a big shift in perception. \n\nThe user is a 20-year-old in a 5-month relationship. They liked him, had a good sex life, but now they feel uncomfortable. They left during his emotional moment, then later feel weird when he texts. Their best friend suggests giving it a bit, but the user isn't as attracted anymore and might be considering breaking up.\n\nI need to analyze if the user's reaction is justified. When someone reveals such a deep trauma, it's natural to have an emotional response. However, immediately distancing or considering breaking up might be seen as insensitive. But the user also might be struggling with their own feelings and how this revelation changes their perception of their partner. \n\nIt's important to note that the user is still in the relationship and hasn't broken up yet. They're conflicted. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. If they're struggling with their feelings and need time to process, that's understandable. But if they're rejecting him without effort to understand or support, that could be problematic.\n\nThe user's reaction might stem from their own biases or misconceptions about rape, especially since the victim is male. They might have internalized stereotypes about male sexuality or strength, making it hard to see their partner the same way. This is a common issue, and it's not necessarily the user's fault they have those feelings. However, choosing to distance themselves without trying to communicate or support their partner could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is allowed to feel uncomfortable and need time to adjust. Relationships require mutual effort, and if the user can't reconcile their feelings, it's valid to step back. But the key point is whether they're in the wrong. If they're being honest about their feelings and trying to process, they might not be at fault. However, if they're dismissing the partner's trauma and not making an effort to understand, that's where they might be wrong.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the user's reaction is primarily about their own discomfort versus the partner's well-being. The user is in the process of considering the relationship, not outright cutting ties. The fact that they haven't broken up yet and are seeking advice suggests they're not entirely in the wrong. However, their immediate reaction of distancing after a traumatic confession could be seen as not being fully supportive. But since they're still in the process and considering the situation, maybe they're not at fault yet.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because people have the right to their feelings and reactions, especially when faced with a significant change in perception. However, it's important that the user addresses their feelings and communicates with their partner rather than just distancing. The question is about being in the wrong, not about what they should do next. Since the user's reaction is a personal struggle and not malicious, they aren't necessarily at fault.\n"
