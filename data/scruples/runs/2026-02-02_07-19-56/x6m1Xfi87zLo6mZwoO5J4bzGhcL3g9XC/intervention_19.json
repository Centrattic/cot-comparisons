Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had been performing poorly in the bedroom, and when confronted, he broke down and confessed his traumatic experience. The author felt shocked because he seemed so macho before, and now her perception is shattered. She left his apartment after he cried and told her about the rape. Now she's unsure about continuing the relationship, even though they aren't officially broken up yet.\n\nThe key points here are about the emotional impact of trauma on both individuals. The boyfriend's disclosure is a significant and sensitive topic. Rape is a severe form of trauma, and survivors often face challenges in relationships because of it. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014she's struggling with a changed perception of her partner and loss of attraction. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. In such situations, it's important to consider empathy and support for the trauma survivor. The boyfriend was vulnerable when sharing this, which is a big step. The author's immediate reaction was to distance herself, but it's unclear if she's given him time to process or if she's being selfish. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions her best friend thinks she should stay, but she's not attracted anymore. Her decision to consider breaking up might be influenced by her own discomfort rather than his well-being. However, people's feelings can change after such revelations, even if they're not at fault. \n\nI need to remember that both people have the right to their feelings. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship she's no longer comfortable with, especially if her feelings have changed. On the other hand, her reaction might be seen as dismissive of his trauma. However, she hasn't cut contact entirely, just considering it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no clear moral fault here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend was open about his trauma, and the author is struggling with her feelings, it's a complex situation. She's not necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, but she might be expected to communicate more clearly and consider the impact on him. However, the problem is her distancing. If she's not trying to understand his trauma or support him, that could be seen as wrong. But if she's just processing her own feelings, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her feelings are valid, and she's not obligated to stay in a relationship she's no longer comfortable with. However, she should handle it with care and empathy. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. Since she hasn't acted yet and is seeking advice, maybe she's not in the wrong for considering it.\n"
