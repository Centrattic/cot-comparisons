Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The boyfriend is 24, they've been dating for 5 months. He's been having trouble performing sexually, and after the author asks, he breaks down and confesses being raped at 11 by his stepbrother. The author feels her image of him as a \"tough guy\" is shattered, leading to her distancing and considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the author's reaction. She's not in the wrong if she's struggling with the new information. Being a victim of rape is a traumatic experience, and the fact that it's a male victim might make the author uncomfortable, especially if she had idealized him before. It's important to consider that everyone processes such revelations differently. \n\nHowever, I should also think about the boyfriend's perspective. He shared something deeply personal, likely in a vulnerable state. The author's immediate reaction was to leave and feel weird about texting him. That might be hurtful to him, especially if he was already in emotional distress. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether her reaction is a natural response to the unexpected information or if she's being dismissive. Since she's not breaking up yet but considering it, and her best friend advises her to continue, it's a situation where she's trying to process. \n\nThe key here is that having a trauma like rape doesn't mean the person is any less of a partner. The author might be struggling with changed perceptions, but it's not necessarily her fault. People have different coping mechanisms. However, the fact that she's distancing might be seen as insensitive if she doesn't make an effort to support him through this. \n\nBut the question isn't about whether her reaction is kind, but if she's in the wrong. The answer would depend on societal expectations. Some might say she's wrong for not being able to accept his trauma, while others might say it's okay to need time. But the author isn't rejecting him for his trauma itself; she's struggling with changed perceptions. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's reacting to a shocking revelation that affects her perception, which is a personal struggle, not a moral failing. However, the way she left him while he was in tears could be seen as a failure to support him, but that's more about the action rather than being in the wrong. \n\nI think the correct answer is B. She's not in the wrong for her feelings, but she might need to reflect on how to handle the relationship moving forward with empathy.\n"
