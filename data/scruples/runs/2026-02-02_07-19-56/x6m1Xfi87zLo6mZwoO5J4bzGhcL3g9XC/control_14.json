Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person writing the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author distancing themselves from their boyfriend after he admits he was raped as a child. The user wants a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend confided in her about his traumatic past, which was unexpected because he seemed macho and dominant. The author felt their image of him was shattered, leading to feeling weird around him and considering breaking up. Her friend suggests she stay, but she's losing attraction. \n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are: 1) Her reaction to his trauma disclosure, 2) Her decision to distance herself, 3) Her feelings of not being attracted anymore.\n\nFrom a general perspective, when someone shares a traumatic experience, it's important to respond with empathy and support. However, the author's reaction is personal. She's struggling with her feelings and attraction. Is she at fault for not being able to cope with this new information? \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't rejecting him out of cruelty but because she's having trouble adjusting. But she hasn't broken up yet, just considering it. Some might say she's in the right because it's okay to reassess a relationship when something significant changes. Others might argue she should give it time and support him more. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because it's a personal decision based on her feelings, and it's not her fault she's struggling. However, some might say she should try harder. But the key here is that the boyfriend opened up, and her immediate reaction was to distance, which could be seen as not supportive. However, she did hold him and let him vent, so she's not entirely dismissive. \n\nThe main point is that people react differently to such news. If she's honest with her feelings and communicates, it's not necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
