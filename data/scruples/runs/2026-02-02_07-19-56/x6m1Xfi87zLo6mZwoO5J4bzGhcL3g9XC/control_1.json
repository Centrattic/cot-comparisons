Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for distancing themselves from their boyfriend after he admitted he was raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The boyfriend is a 24-year-old man who was raped at age 11 by his stepbrother. The author is a 20-year-old woman who's been dating him for five months. They have a good relationship, including a good sex life, but recently he's been having performance issues. He breaks down and tells her about his past trauma, which is a big shock to her because he seemed \"macho\" before. After this, she leaves during a visit to his apartment and is now feeling conflicted, not as attracted to him as before. Her friend suggests staying, but she's considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is disclosing a traumatic experience that's affecting his current life, including their relationship. The author is reacting with emotional distance, possibly due to a changed perception of him. It's important to recognize that being a rape victim doesn't change who the person is, but the author's feelings are valid in terms of her own comfort and attraction. \n\nHowever, relationships require support, especially when someone is vulnerable. The author leaving during a moment of emotional breakdown might be seen as unsupportive. But she might need time to process. Also, her attraction issues could be a result of the trauma's impact on her view of him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling a certain way, but her decision to distance might be seen as a failure to support her partner during a vulnerable time. However, it's also about personal boundaries and emotional readiness. There's no universal answer, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn this context, the answer is B (No) because people can have complex emotional reactions to such revelations, and while her partner needs support, the author isn't wrong for struggling with her feelings. It's a personal choice, not a moral failing.\n"
