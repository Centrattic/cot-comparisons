Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for distancing themselves from their boyfriend after he admitted he was raped.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The boyfriend is 24, they've been dating for 5 months. He's had trouble performing sexually, and when she asked, he broke down and shared that he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. The writer felt shocked because he had a \"macho\" image before. She held him, let him vent, then left. Now she's feeling weird about seeing his texts and considering breaking up. Her friend thinks she should stay, but she's not as attracted to him anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. \n\nRape is a traumatic experience, and sharing it is a significant moment in a relationship. The boyfriend needed support, but the girlfriend's reaction was to distance herself. Even though she didn't explicitly end the relationship, she's considering it. \n\nIs it wrong to feel this way? Well, people react differently to trauma. The girlfriend's attraction decreased, which might be a natural reaction if her perception of him changed. But she's the one who initiated the physical intimacy before, so maybe she's conflicted about his vulnerability. \n\nHowever, distancing after such a vulnerable moment can be hurtful. He was in tears, trusting her with a deep secret. If she can't support him through this, it might be a red flag for her own readiness to handle such issues in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, she's not obligated to stay if she can't handle it. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key factors are her reaction\u2014leaving him during the emotional moment, then not being able to maintain the relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone shares a traumatic experience and the partner distances themselves, it could be seen as not supportive. However, she didn't push him to share; he did it voluntarily. She tried to comfort him but left. Maybe her actions were a coping mechanism. \n\nIn relationships, when someone discloses trauma, the partner's support is crucial. If she can't handle it, it's her choice to end things, but the question is about being in the wrong. I think the answer would be that she's not wrong because she's allowed to feel that way, but it's not the best choice. However, the user's initial thought is that she is in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), meaning the author is not in the wrong. Alternatively, if A is yes, she is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that she's reacting to a new and shocking revelation, it's a complex situation. She's not in the wrong for feeling this way, but it's a tough position to be in. However, the act of distancing after such a vulnerable moment might be seen as not being supportive, which would make her in the wrong. But I'm not sure. It's a tricky balance between personal feelings and partner support. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), because she's not obligated to stay in the relationship if she can't handle it, even if her reaction could be seen as insensitive. But the line is thin. The key is whether she's in the wrong ethically. The user's perspective is that she is, but maybe the correct answer is B.\n"
