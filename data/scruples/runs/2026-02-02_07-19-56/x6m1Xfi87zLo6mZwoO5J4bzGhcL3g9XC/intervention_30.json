I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old woman in a 5-month relationship with her 24-year-old boyfriend. He's described as tall, muscular, blonde, and a bit dominant. Their sex life is good, but he's been having trouble performing. She asks him, and he breaks down, telling her he was raped at 11 by his stepbrother. He's been seeing a therapist for his childhood. After the confession, she leaves when they're at his apartment. Now, she's feeling weird about texting him and considering ending the relationship. Her friend says she should keep dating him, but she's not as attracted anymore. She's asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The boyfriend's trauma is significant. Rape is a traumatic experience, and it's brave of him to share it. The fact that he's been seeing a therapist shows he's dealing with it, but it's clear it's affecting his current life, especially their relationship. The author's reaction is to distance herself, leave during a vulnerable moment, and now she's struggling with attraction and considering breaking up. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she might feel shocked because her image of him as a \"tough guy\" has been shattered. This could lead to a conflict in her perception of him, affecting her attraction. But is that a valid reason to distance herself? Trauma survivors often experience changes in their relationships, and the partner's response is crucial. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's trauma might be affecting his ability to perform sexually, which the author might not be equipped to handle. She might not know how to support him, leading to her withdrawal. However, walking away after such a vulnerable confession could be seen as insensitive. \n\nThe key points here are empathy, understanding, and support. The author's reaction is to leave emotionally, which might not be fair to the boyfriend who is already in a fragile state. It's possible that she's not in the wrong if she's struggling with her feelings, but the way she's handling it could be seen as a failure to support him during his time of need. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that the author has her own feelings and boundaries. If she's not able to adjust her feelings and support him, it might not be a sustainable relationship. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for considering ending it. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often pressure to support a partner through trauma, but that's not always realistic. However, the immediate reaction of distancing herself after he's vulnerable could be seen as harsh. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong entirely. She's experiencing a conflict in her feelings, which is natural. However, the way she's handling it\u2014leaving during a breakdown and not communicating effectively\u2014might be problematic. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because her feelings are valid, but she could be in the wrong for not supporting him. \n\nWait, but the user who wrote this is asking if she's in the wrong. The original poster (AITA) wants to know if they've done something wrong. If the boyfriend's trauma is real and he's seeking help, then the author's reaction might be seen as a failure to support, making her in the wrong. But if her feelings are genuine and she's not able to handle the situation, maybe she's not in the wrong. It's tricky. \n\nI think the key is that she's choosing to distance herself after he's vulnerable. That could be seen as inconsiderate, hence AITA. But maybe not. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. \n\nIn the end, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because people have different reactions, and she's not obligated to stay in a relationship she's no longer comfortable in. However, she could be in the wrong if she's dismissive of his trauma. But given the information, she's struggling with her own feelings, so B makes sense.\n"
