Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend had been struggling with performance issues, and when confronted, he confessed to being raped. The woman felt her image of him shattered and is now unsure about continuing the relationship. Her friend suggests staying, but she's losing attraction.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nSo, what's the ethical angle here? Rape is a traumatic experience, and survivors often face stigma or judgment. The boyfriend was vulnerable sharing his past, which is a significant step. The woman's reaction is to distance herself, which could be seen as invalidating his experience. However, people have the right to their feelings and reactions. \n\nIs it wrong to feel this way? Emotionally, it's valid for someone to struggle with how they perceive a partner after such a revelation. But the question is whether her reaction is justified. The problem is that she's distancing herself, which might be harmful or dismissive of his trauma. On the other hand, if she can't support him or feel the same connection, it's not necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense, but perhaps inconsiderate. \n\nSociety often has misconceptions about male survivors, and her reaction could reinforce those. However, she's not the one who caused the trauma. She's processing her feelings, which is a personal matter. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if she's not abusive or cruel but is just struggling with her emotions, it's more about compatibility. The issue is whether she's wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. Since people can't be forced to stay in relationships they aren't comfortable in, maybe it's not her fault. However, the way she handles it (leaving abruptly, not supporting him) could be problematic. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether she's in the wrong. If she's not being malicious, just having a hard time adjusting, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's dismissing his trauma without empathy, that's another angle. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because people have different reactions to trauma disclosures, and it's not her fault if she can't reconcile her feelings. However, she should consider being honest with him about her struggles if she continues the relationship. The key is that she's not at fault for her feelings, even if her actions could be seen as insensitive. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about insensitivity. So B.\n"
