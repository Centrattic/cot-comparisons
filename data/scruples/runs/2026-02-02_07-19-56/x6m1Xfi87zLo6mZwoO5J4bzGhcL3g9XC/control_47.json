Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a 20-year-old woman dating a 24-year-old boyfriend for five months. He's been acting dominant and macho, which she found attractive. Then he starts having trouble with performance, and she asks him about it. He breaks down and admits he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. After that, he starts seeing a therapist, and the author distances herself. She feels weird when he texts her now and her attraction is gone. Her best friend says she should give it a bit more time, but she's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Rape is a traumatic experience, and disclosing it is a significant and vulnerable act. The boyfriend shared this because he was struggling, and it came up through his performance issues. The author's reaction is to feel that her image of him is shattered and she's no longer attracted. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong for distancing herself after he disclosed this.\n\nI should think about the impact of such a disclosure. Rape is a serious violation, and the survivor might need support and understanding. The author left when he was in tears, which could be a moment of vulnerability. However, she might be feeling overwhelmed or unsure how to handle the new information. Her attraction issues might be part of that. But is that her fault? It's possible that she's reacting to a change in her perception of him, which is a personal and emotional response. However, it's important to consider if her reaction is dismissive or if she's given him space to process and recover.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is seeing a therapist, so maybe he's in the early stages of dealing with his trauma. The author's decision to distance might be due to her own discomfort, but it's not necessarily wrong if she's struggling with the relationship dynamics. However, it's crucial to evaluate her approach. Is she being unsupportive, or is she taking time to process her feelings? The key here is whether she's making a judgment about him based on the trauma he experienced. Rape is not a character flaw, and the author's changed perception might be part of the adjustment. \n\nBut the author is in a new relationship (five months), so her feelings could be genuine. She might feel that the aspect of his identity she didn't know about is affecting her attraction. However, it's important to approach this with empathy. The boyfriend might be dealing with a lot, and the author's distancing could be seen as a lack of support. On the other hand, she's not obligated to continue the relationship if she's no longer comfortable. \n\nThe question is about whether she's \"in the wrong.\" If she's not being cruel or judgmental, but just struggling with the change in how she sees him, that's a personal reaction and not necessarily wrong. But if she's using this as an excuse to end the relationship without understanding or trying to support him, that might be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that she left him when he was crying might indicate she didn't handle it well, but her feelings afterward are complex. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author is being ungrateful or not, versus having a genuine emotional response. Since the situation is new, and she's not completely broken up, it's possible she's going through a natural process of adjusting to new information. But the key is that she needs to communicate with him and consider his needs as a survivor. If she's distancing herself without acknowledging the trauma and without trying to find a way to support him, she might be at fault. However, if she's honestly struggling with the shift in her image of him and her attraction, that's more about her personal feelings than being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer here is B, No, because the author isn't in the wrong for having changed feelings after such a disclosure. However, she should consider how to approach the situation with empathy and maybe talk to her bf about her feelings instead of just distancing. But the question is if she's in the wrong, not if she's handling it perfectly. So, in a \"AITA\" scenario, the user is asking if they're the asshole, and the answer would be B, No, because it's a personal struggle, not malice.\n"
