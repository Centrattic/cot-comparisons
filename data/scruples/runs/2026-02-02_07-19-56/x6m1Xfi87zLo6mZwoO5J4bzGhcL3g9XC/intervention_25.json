Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after distancing herself from her boyfriend following his confession of being raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The boyfriend is a 24-year-old with a traumatic past, which he's just shared with his partner. The author mentions that her perception of him as a \"macho\" and \"tough guy\" has been shattered. This could lead to a shift in how she views him, possibly affecting her attraction and emotional connection.\n\nNext, the author's reaction is to distance herself. She left the apartment where they were and now feels weird when he texts her. Her best friend advises her to give it a chance, but she's considering breaking up. The key here is whether her reaction is a valid response to a traumatic disclosure or if it's inconsiderate.\n\nRape is a severe trauma, and the survivor's experience is valid and deserves empathy. The boyfriend is seeking therapy, which is a positive step. The author's initial understanding that it's \"horrible being a rape victim\" suggests she recognizes the severity. However, her emotional reaction leading to distance might be a personal struggle with reconciling her previous image of him with his vulnerability.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author might be grappling with her own feelings and discomfort, which is understandable. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If her reaction is based on a lack of attraction due to changed perceptions, that's a personal choice. But pushing away someone who's vulnerable and shared such a painful secret could be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to their feelings and can't force attraction. If the relationship is no longer fulfilling for the author, she's not necessarily in the wrong for considering it. However, the way she's distancing without addressing it openly could be problematic. The key is whether she's being fair and supportive given his situation.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the author's reaction is a valid personal choice or if she's failing to support her partner during a vulnerable time. If she's not in a place to support him and continues the relationship out of obligation, that's different. But if she's choosing to end it because of her own feelings, that's more about her personal boundaries, which can be valid. However, the way she's reacting (distancing without clear communication) might make her look inconsiderate. \n\nOverall, while she's not necessarily \"in the wrong\" for feeling this way, her actions might not be the most supportive. The answer would be B (No), as she's not in the wrong for her feelings, but it's a complex situation where both parties have valid perspectives."
