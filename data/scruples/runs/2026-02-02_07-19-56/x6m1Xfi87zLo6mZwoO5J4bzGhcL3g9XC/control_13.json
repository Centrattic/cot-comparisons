Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the boyfriend disclosed being raped as a child, and the author is now distancing herself, feeling uneasy and less attracted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend has shared a traumatic experience. It's a big deal, and it's affecting the relationship. The author is confused because her previous perception of him as \"macho\" clashes with this new information. She's feeling weird and not as attracted, leading her to consider breaking up or distancing.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's not being malicious. She's having a hard time adjusting her perception. But the key points are her reaction and the context. Rape is a serious trauma, and the boyfriend is seeking help through therapy. The author is struggling with her feelings, which is understandable, but does that make her wrong?\n\nOn one hand, relationships require support through tough times. If she can't support him after such a disclosure, that's a red flag. On the other hand, it's okay to have conflicting emotions. People react differently to trauma disclosures. However, the author's immediate reaction is to distance and question her attraction, which might not be the healthiest approach. She's not giving him space to heal or processing her feelings before making a decision. Her best friend suggests giving it some time, which is sound advice. But she's considering a breakup already.\n\nIs she in the wrong for feeling that way? Emotionally, it's complex. But in terms of right and wrong, maybe not. It's a personal struggle, but maybe she's not handling it well. The boyfriend is in a vulnerable state, and her distancing might not be supportive. However, it's also her right to feel uncomfortable and reassess the relationship. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but she needs to be more supportive. Wait, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not acting with malice but is reacting to her feelings, then perhaps she's not in the wrong. But she might be making a mistake by not trying to work through it. The answer here is B, No, she's not in the wrong, but she might need to reflect more.\n"
