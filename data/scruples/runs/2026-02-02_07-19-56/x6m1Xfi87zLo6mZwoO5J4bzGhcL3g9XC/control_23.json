Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old woman in a 5-month relationship with her 24-year-old boyfriend. He's described as tall, muscular, blonde, blue-eyed, dominant, and works in marketing at a startup. They have a good sex life, but he started having performance issues a week and a half ago. When she asked, he broke down and cried, revealing he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother and has been in therapy for his childhood. The author was shocked because he seemed like a \"tough guy\" before, and now she's struggling with her image of him. After he confessed, she left his apartment and isn't as attracted to him anymore. Her friend suggests she should give it time, but she's thinking about breaking up. She's asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, let me recall what AITA (Am I the Asshole) typically looks like. The subreddit often evaluates whether the person's actions are reasonable or if they're being selfish, inconsiderate, etc. So the key here is whether the author's reaction is justified or if she's wrong to distance herself.\n\nThe boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience. Rape is a serious trauma, and coming forward takes a lot of courage. The author was initially surprised because he had a macho image, but that's not uncommon for survivors. People often hide their vulnerabilities, especially if they fear judgment. The author held him while he vented, which shows she was supportive at the moment, but then left. Now she feels weird seeing his texts and isn't as attracted as before, leading her to consider breaking up.\n\nIs it wrong to feel this way? Well, people have different reactions to trauma disclosures. Some might need time to process, others might feel empathy and want to support. The author isn't rejecting him for the rape itself, but for the fact that it shattered her previous image of him. She's still in the relationship but considering distancing. \n\nBut wait, she left during the emotional moment. However, leaving immediately might be a reaction to shock or discomfort. It's possible she wasn't prepared to handle the situation and needed space. But after that, she's not making an effort to reconnect, which could be seen as not supporting him. \n\nHowever, the main issue is her attraction. She's saying she's not as attracted because of his trauma. That's a bit tricky. Trauma can affect a person's behavior and sexual function, but if the author is finding it hard to see him the same way, that's a personal issue. She might be struggling with her own prejudices or misconceptions about male survivors of sexual violence. \n\nThe boyfriend is seeking therapy, which is a positive step. The author's friend is advising her to give it time. But she's not in the wrong if she's not ready to continue the relationship. However, she should consider if her reaction is fair. It's important to distinguish between a reaction to the trauma and a lack of effort to adjust her perspective. \n\nIs it the author's fault for having this reaction? People's reactions can vary, and if she's not able to support him, maybe she is the asshole for ending the relationship over something that's not his fault. But if she's having a genuine, emotional response that she can't control, that's different. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend might need more support. Ending the relationship right after such a confession could be seen as abandoning him when he's vulnerable. But she's only been in the relationship for 5 months. It's a short time, so maybe her feelings are valid. \n\nI think the key here is whether she's making a judgment about him based on his trauma. Rape is a violent act, and the victim's identity isn't changed by it. If she can't accept his vulnerability, that's a problem. But if she's struggling with her own feelings, she's not necessarily in the wrong. However, walking away without trying to communicate further might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because she's not in the wrong for having this reaction, but she should reflect on her feelings and consider if she's ready to support him. Alternatively, some might argue she is in the wrong for not trying to work through it. But given the AITA context, the community often considers the person's reaction to be reasonable if they explain it honestly. Since she's not blaming him but her own changed perception, it's more about her feelings rather than his actions. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
