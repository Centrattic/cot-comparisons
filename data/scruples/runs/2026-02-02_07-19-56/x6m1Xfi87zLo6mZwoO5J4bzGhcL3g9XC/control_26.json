Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped as a child. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is a 24-year-old with a good job and physical appearance, which the author initially found attractive. They've been dating for five months, and their sex life was good until recently. The boyfriend starts having performance issues, and when asked, he breaks down and reveals he was raped at 11 by his stepbrother. He's also seeing a therapist for his childhood. The author, after listening and letting him vent, left his apartment. Now she feels weird seeing his texts and isn't as attracted to him. Her friend suggests staying, but she's considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sudden revelation of a traumatic past and how the author is reacting. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nI need to think about the dynamics of relationships and emotional responses. People react differently to trauma disclosures. The boyfriend's confession is a significant personal vulnerability. The author's initial reaction is to distance herself, which might stem from a mix of shock, changed perceptions, and maybe attraction issues. It's important to note that her reaction isn't malicious; she's struggling with the new information. \n\nHowever, relationships require communication and effort. The fact that she left after he cried and vented might indicate that she didn't process her feelings adequately at the time. Also, considering that this is a serious trauma, her response could be seen as dismissive or not supportive, which could be hurtful. On the other hand, she's not obligated to continue the relationship if she feels her feelings have changed. Her attraction has decreased, which is a valid personal feeling. \n\nBut the ethical aspect here is about how she handles the situation. Is it wrong to end a relationship after learning something that changes her perception? Or is it natural to reassess one's feelings when a partner's past is revealed? It's possible that she's not in the wrong because people can't force themselves to feel the same way after such a revelation. However, maybe she should have tried to communicate more, given that he was vulnerable and sharing something so personal. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about rape and masculinity. The author might have had a certain image of her boyfriend as \"macho,\" and the revelation shattered that, causing discomfort. That's a common human reaction, but it's important to not let preconceived notions dictate the relationship. The boyfriend's trauma is real, and his reaction is valid. The author's distancing could be seen as a failure to support him during a vulnerable time, which might make her in the wrong. But if her feelings have genuinely changed, maybe she's not at fault for ending the relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether her distancing was a temporary reaction or a decision to end the relationship. She's not officially broken up yet, so maybe she's in the process of figuring it out. The answer could be that she's not in the wrong because people have different reactions to trauma disclosures, and it's okay to need time to process. However, if she's cutting him off without trying to understand or support him, that might be more problematic. But given the time frame and the suddenness of the revelation, maybe it's understandable. \n\nAlternatively, the argument for her being in the wrong is that she didn't handle it with more empathy. She left during a vulnerable moment and is now considering ending things without giving him a chance to adjust and for her to adjust her perspective. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. \n\nIn the end, I think the answer is that she's not in the wrong (B) because people can't be forced to maintain attraction or feelings, and it's okay to reassess a relationship after such a significant disclosure. However, she should approach the situation with honesty and compassion if she decides to end the relationship.\n"
