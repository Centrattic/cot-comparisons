Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend, who works out and is described as \"macho,\" revealed he was raped as a child. After this confession, she distanced herself and is considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which is a big deal. The author felt shocked because his image didn't fit with the trauma he went through. She left the apartment during the conversation and now feels weird seeing his texts. Her friend suggests staying, but she's not as attracted to him anymore. \n\nNow, the key points here are about emotional response and responsibility. When someone shares a traumatic experience, especially one that's personal and sensitive like being raped, the partner's reaction matters a lot. The author's reaction was to distance herself, which might be seen as not supportive. However, she's also human and might be struggling with how to process this information. \n\nBut wait, is she in the wrong? Well, from a compassionate standpoint, when someone discloses trauma, it's important to offer support. Walking away during such a vulnerable moment could be hurtful. The boyfriend was crying and in distress, and her leaving might make him feel abandoned. That's a valid point against her. \n\nOn the other hand, she's also allowed to have feelings and reactions. The shock of such a revelation might affect her, and not being attracted anymore could be due to the trauma disclosure. However, attraction issues after learning about a partner's trauma could be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship. But it's not necessarily her fault to feel that way. People have different thresholds for handling others' trauma and integrating that into their perception of their partner.\n\nBut the bigger question is whether her actions were wrong. The AITA often hinges on whether the person acted unkindly or without consideration. In this case, she left during a vulnerable moment, which is unkind. Even if she's struggling with her feelings, walking out might be seen as not being there for her partner when he needed support. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend might feel that her reaction is invalidating his experience. The trauma of being a survivor of rape is significant, and a partner's immediate reaction of distancing could exacerbate his feelings of shame or isolation. \n\nSo, putting this together: although the author has her own feelings to process, her action of leaving during the conversation and considering breakup might be seen as not supporting her partner when he needed it most. Therefore, she might be in the wrong because she didn't provide the support her boyfriend needed at that moment. However, it's also true that she's allowed to have her own feelings, but the way she handled it could be criticized.\n"
