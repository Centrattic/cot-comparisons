Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped as a child. The situation is complicated because there's a lot going on here.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend revealed a traumatic experience. He was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother, which is a really serious and painful thing. He's been having trouble performing sexually since a week and a half before the confession. The author, who's been in the relationship for 5 months, is now feeling weird and not as attracted to him. She left his apartment after he broke down and is considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From one perspective, he shared something deeply personal and vulnerable. It's a significant part of his life history that could affect their relationship. He might have needed support and understanding, and her reaction of distancing herself could be hurtful. Relationships require trust and support, especially when someone discloses trauma. Her pulling away might be seen as invalidating his experience or not being able to handle his vulnerability.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also dealing with her own feelings and reactions. She mentions that her image of him being \"macho\" shattered, and she's struggling with attraction. It's possible that she's not prepared for this aspect of his past, and her feelings are genuine. People have different capacities to handle their partner's trauma, and it's not always a matter of right or wrong. She might be in a position where she can't move forward knowing this, even though it's not her fault.\n\nBut in terms of ethical responsibility, when someone shares such a traumatic experience, the listener is expected to be supportive, not react with rejection. The author might not be malicious, but her reaction could be seen as insensitive. However, she's also human and has her own feelings. It's a tricky situation where both parties might be doing their best but facing challenges. The key here is whether she had a duty to stay in the relationship despite her feelings. Since she hasn't broken up yet, maybe she should try to work through it, but it's also okay to acknowledge that some people can't handle such information and may need to part ways. However, the initial reaction of distancing after such a confession might be seen as not supporting him, which could make her at fault.\n\nBut considering the short duration of the relationship (5 months), maybe she hasn't had enough time to process this. Also, trauma disclosures can be overwhelming. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. If she's not able to support him through this, maybe it's not fair to keep the relationship going. However, walking away so quickly after he's vulnerable could be seen as inconsiderate. So, there are arguments on both sides. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not malicious and is reacting honestly to her feelings, maybe not. However, the expectation in relationships is to be supportive, so her reaction might be seen as wrong.\n"
