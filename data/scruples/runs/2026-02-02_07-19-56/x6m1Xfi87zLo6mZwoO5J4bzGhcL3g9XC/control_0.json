Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend, who is 24 and her boyfriend of 5 months, starts having trouble performing sexually. He breaks down and reveals he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. The author felt shocked because she had an image of him as a \"macho\" or \"tough guy.\" After he confesses, she comforts him but leaves. Now, she's feeling weird seeing his texts, her attraction is gone, and she's considering breaking up. Her best friend thinks she should stay, but she's uncertain.\n\nThe key points here are about emotional response and relationship dynamics. Rape is a traumatic experience, and disclosure can be very vulnerable. The boyfriend is seeking counseling, which is a positive step. The author's reaction is to distance herself, which might be due to her own feelings of discomfort or changed perception of him. \n\nIs she wrong? Well, people have different reactions to trauma disclosures. Some might need time to process, others might struggle with attraction due to the new information. But the boyfriend's trauma is a significant part of his identity, and the author's immediate reaction could be seen as invalidating his experience. However, it's also important to consider her feelings. She might not have anticipated how this revelation would affect her, and it's her right to feel a certain way. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility, relationships require communication and effort. The author hasn't broken up yet, so maybe she needs to talk to him about her feelings. However, the question is whether she's at fault. If she's struggling with her reaction, it's part of her personal journey, but if she's rejecting him without effort to understand or support, that's problematic. The answer depends on whether her distancing is seen as a natural reaction or a failure to support him. Since the story is from her perspective, and she's seeking advice, it's possible she's not in the wrong because she's still processing, but she might need to work on her feelings. However, the fact that she's considering breaking up without addressing it could imply some fault. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the relationship outcome. The answer is B (not in the wrong) because her reaction is a personal struggle, not intentional harm.\n"
