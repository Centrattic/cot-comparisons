Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for distancing from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped as a child. The boyfriend is 24, she's 20, and they've been dating five months. He had issues performing in bed, which led to him breaking down and confessing the trauma. She left the apartment and now feels weird about texting him, considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He shared a deeply personal trauma, which is a big deal. It's natural for someone to need time to process such information. The author might be struggling with how to react, especially if her initial image of him as \"macho\" clashed with this revelation. Trauma can affect people in various ways, and his performance issues could be linked to that.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's disclosure is significant, and the author's reaction could be seen as a lack of support. However, it's also valid for her to feel conflicted. People have different thresholds for handling such disclosures, and she's not obligated to continue the relationship if the connection is lost. Her best friend's advice to give it time is common, but ultimately, it's her decision based on her feelings.\n\nThe key here is understanding that both parties have valid perspectives. The author isn't in the wrong for needing space or considering ending the relationship. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship if her feelings change. However, she might need to reflect on whether her reaction is based on his trauma or other factors. But from the information given, her feelings are real, and she's not in the wrong for acting on them. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
