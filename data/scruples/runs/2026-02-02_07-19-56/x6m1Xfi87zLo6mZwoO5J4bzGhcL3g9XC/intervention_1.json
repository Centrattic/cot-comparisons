Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 20-year-old woman who's been dating her 24-year-old boyfriend for five months. He's revealed that he was raped at 11 by his stepbrother, and she's now distancing herself.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend's trauma could be affecting his current behavior and relationship dynamics. The woman initially thought the performance issues were her fault but then found out about his past. She's struggling with her feelings and considering breaking up, even though they're not officially separated yet.\n\nNow, considering the possible answers\u2014A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not). I need to evaluate if her reaction is justified. People have different coping mechanisms. She might be experiencing a shift in her perception of him after such a revelation. Trauma can affect relationships, and it's not uncommon for someone to feel disconnected after learning about a partner's trauma, especially if it's impacting their sex life and emotional state.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the survivor's perspective. The boyfriend is dealing with his own healing process, and the woman's reaction might be seen as invalidating his experience. But she's also dealing with her own emotions and attraction. The question is whether her distancing herself is a fair response or if she's being insensitive.\n\nIn these situations, it's often about mutual effort. If she's not able to support him through this, it might not be a healthy relationship. But she's not in the wrong for having feelings she can't control. Attraction can wane for various reasons, and it's not entirely her fault. However, she should consider whether the breakup is due to his trauma or other underlying issues she hadn't addressed before.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether her reaction is a natural response to a significant change in her perception of him or if she's dismissing his experience. Since she's struggling with her feelings and hasn't completely cut ties yet, it's possible she's in the middle of processing this. The fact that she's seeking advice suggests she's trying to be fair, but her attraction is affected, which complicates things.\n\nIn conclusion, while her feelings are valid, distancing immediately after such a vulnerable confession might be seen as not fully supporting her partner. But given the complexity of emotions and attraction, it's not necessarily her fault. The answer might lean towards B (she's not in the wrong) because people can have valid reasons for not wanting to continue a relationship after such a revelation, especially if it impacts their emotional connection and attraction.\n"
