Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about whether the author is at fault for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend admitted to being raped when he was 11 by his stepbrother. The author mentions that she felt her image of him as a \"macho\" and \"tough guy\" shattered. Now she's not as attracted to him and is considering breaking up.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend is sharing a traumatic experience, which is very sensitive. It takes a lot of courage to open up about such a personal and traumatic event. The fact that he started seeing a therapist suggests he's working through it, and the author's immediate reaction was to leave and now she's having feelings of not being attracted anymore. That could be seen as dismissive or not supportive.\n\nOn the other hand, dealing with this revelation might have been unexpected for the author. She might be struggling with the new information and adjusting her perception of her partner. It's possible she's experiencing a natural emotional response, but it's important to consider how she's handling it. Distancing and considering a breakup without really trying to work through it might be a problem. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, people have different coping mechanisms and emotional reactions. The question is whether her response is justified. Trauma can affect a person's ability to be in a relationship, and if the author can't support her partner through this, maybe it's a valid reason to end the relationship. However, cutting off or distancing right after such a vulnerable moment might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nThe key points here are support, communication, and understanding. If the author is struggling with her feelings, it's important to communicate that and perhaps seek counseling together. But if she can't accept this part of him, then maybe it's not a healthy relationship. The author's reaction isn't malicious, but it's about personal conflict. So, is she at fault? Possibly not, but she needs to handle it more thoughtfully. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's grappling with her emotions and the situation is complex, it might not be a clear-cut case of her being wrong. But if she's distancing without giving it time or support, that could be an issue. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because people have different emotional responses, and it's valid to struggle with acceptance here. However, the way she's handling it (leaving and considering breaking up) might not be the best approach. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the answer might lean towards no because it's a complex situation and she's not being intentionally harmful. So I think the answer is B.\n"
