Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child. The question is whether she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had a traumatic experience, which can affect his mental health and relationship dynamics. The woman is now struggling with how to handle this. She's not necessarily rejecting him, but her feelings towards him have changed. She's confused and unsure about staying in the relationship. \n\nNow, the woman's reaction: she felt weird, her attraction decreased, and she left the situation. It's important to note that people react differently to trauma disclosures. Some might need time to process, which she's doing. But the key here is whether her response is unjustified. \n\nThe boyfriend's trauma is a significant part of his identity. The woman's initial view of him as \"macho\" contrasts with his vulnerability, which might have triggered a sense of discomfort. She's not denying his experience but is struggling with her own feelings. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she hasn't ended the relationship yet and is considering it. She's seeking advice, which shows she's trying to handle it thoughtfully. Her reaction is a personal struggle with attraction and emotional comfort. However, she's not attacking him or being dismissive of his trauma. She's trying to navigate her feelings, which is a normal process. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should try to support him through this. But it's also important to respect one's own feelings and boundaries. People can't force attraction or emotional compatibility. It's possible she's not the one for him, and that's not her fault. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether her reaction is a valid personal struggle versus being inconsiderate. Since she's not dismissing his trauma but dealing with her own emotions, B (not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
