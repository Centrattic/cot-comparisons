Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her about being raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is a 24-year-old man, and they've been dating for 5 months. He's been having trouble performing in bed, and when she asked, he broke down and told her he was raped by his stepbrother starting at 11. Up until that point, he seemed \"macho\" and dominant. The author felt her image of him shattered and now feels weird when he texts her, even though they're not officially broken up yet.\n\nThe question is whether she's at fault. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nI should consider a few things here. First, the boyfriend's trauma. Childhood sexual abuse is a serious issue, and it can affect someone's mental health and relationships later in life. The fact that he's seeking therapy is a positive step, but the author is struggling with her feelings. \n\nThe author's reaction: She left after he cried and confessed, which might have been a shock. But she's now distancing herself. Is it wrong to feel that way? Well, people have different reactions to trauma. Some might find it hard to adjust their perception of someone they thought was a \"tough guy.\" However, it's important to remember that the abuse was in the past and doesn't define his current identity. The author is in a new relationship, and this is a significant issue that can impact the relationship's future.\n\nOn the other hand, her best friend suggests she should give it time. It's possible she needs to process this information. The problem is that she's not in the wrong for feeling this way, but she might be in the wrong if she's not making an effort to support him or communicate her feelings instead of just distancing. The key here is how she handles it. \n\nBut the user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer depends on the context. The author's feelings are valid because this is a new and shocking revelation. However, the way she's reacting by distancing might be a problem if it's dismissive or not communicative. The post says she left but then the next day, she's considering breaking up. \n\nBut the bigger issue is that she's not seeing him the same way. That's natural, but it's important to address it. The question is whether she's wrong for not being able to handle this. Since the boyfriend is opening up about his trauma, the author's reaction is about her own ability to accept that part of him. It's not necessarily her fault, but it's also not right to dismiss him without trying to work through it. \n\nThe answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). Because it's a new relationship, and the shock of such a traumatic event can affect someone's perception and attraction. However, she should communicate her feelings and be honest. But the question is about being in the wrong, which is a moral judgment. Since the boyfriend's trauma is valid, the author's reaction isn't wrong, though it's a tough situation. The problem might be in her not addressing it properly, but the initial reaction isn't necessarily her fault.\n"
