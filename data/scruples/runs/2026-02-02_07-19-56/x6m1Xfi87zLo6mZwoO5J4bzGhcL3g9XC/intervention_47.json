Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend has been dealing with performance issues and, after breaking down, confesses his traumatic past. The author is left feeling conflicted, her initial image of him as a \"tough guy\" now shattered. She left his apartment and is considering ending the relationship.\n\nNow, how to approach this. On one hand, the boyfriend is sharing a deeply personal and traumatic experience. This is a vulnerable moment, and the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive or not supportive. On the other hand, people have different reactions to such revelations. The author might be struggling with her feelings, maybe not knowing how to handle the new information, leading to emotional distance.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and communication. The boyfriend needed support during a vulnerable time, and the author's immediate reaction was to leave. However, human reactions aren't always perfect. Trauma and its aftermath can complicate relationships. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but the way she handled it\u2014leaving without addressing it\u2014could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship is 5 months. It's possible she wasn't prepared for such a deep conversation so early on. But regardless of when it happened, the boyfriend's disclosure is valid and significant. The author's struggle with attraction and image isn't her fault, but reacting by distancing herself without giving the relationship a chance to adjust might be where she's at fault.\n\nThe best friend's advice to give it more time is a point to consider. The author might need to process her feelings, but cutting off the relationship immediately after his confession could be seen as not giving him the support he needed. However, it's also her right to feel uncomfortable and to reassess the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships are complex. Feeling conflicted isn't inherently wrong, but how one handles those feelings matters. The author's decision to leave might be inconsiderate, especially after he was so vulnerable. But she's also not obligated to stay in a relationship that makes her uncomfortable once she knows this information.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because people have different emotional reactions and she's processing a significant revelation. However, her handling of the situation could be seen as lacking support, which complicates the answer. But given the context of someone sharing trauma and the other person struggling with the aftermath, it's a nuanced situation where neither party is entirely wrong. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because her reaction is a personal struggle with the information, not a malicious act.\n"
