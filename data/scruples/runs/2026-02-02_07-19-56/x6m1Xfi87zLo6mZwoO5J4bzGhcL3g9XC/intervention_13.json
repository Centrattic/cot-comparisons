Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her about being raped. The situation is that the boyfriend, who is 24, revealed he was raped at age 11. The author, 20, is now struggling with how to feel about him, and her attraction has diminished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend confided in her about a traumatic experience, which is a significant and vulnerable moment. The author is now feeling conflicted, possibly because her previous image of him as a \"macho\" guy clashed with this revelation. She's distancing herself, which the boyfriend might find hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships can be complex. If the author is having trouble continuing the relationship because of this, it's not necessarily a moral failing. People have different reactions to such news. However, the key point is whether she's in the wrong for her response. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel that sharing such personal information was a trust issue, and if she's pulling away, that could hurt him. On the other hand, the author is dealing with her own emotions and attraction, which are valid. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she's not comfortable. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's choosing to distance herself without giving him a chance to process or if she's invalidating his trauma, that might be wrong. However, if she's struggling with her feelings and isn't ready to move forward, that's more about her own feelings rather than being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's dealing with her emotions and attraction, which are personal and not a moral failing. She might need to communicate her feelings to her boyfriend, but the act of distancing herself isn't inherently her fault.\n"
