Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after deciding to distance herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is a 24-year-old who's been in a 5-month relationship with a 20-year-old. He's described as dominant and macho, which might have influenced her initial perception. He recently started therapy and disclosed a traumatic experience from his childhood. The author felt her image of him shattered and now feels weird about interacting with him, leading her to consider ending the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are the disclosure of past trauma and the author's reaction. When someone shares such a sensitive and personal issue, it's a significant moment. The author's immediate reaction was to leave the situation and is now considering ending the relationship. \n\nEmotionally, it's possible that the author is struggling with the cognitive dissonance between her previous image of her boyfriend (as a strong, macho person) and the reality of his traumatic past. This can be jarring and might lead to a reassessment of the relationship. However, the question is whether her reaction makes her \"in the wrong.\"\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider empathy and understanding. The boyfriend is dealing with a serious issue that's affecting his current well-being (as seen in his performance anxiety). The author's response of distancing herself might be seen as self-centered if it's purely about her own discomfort rather than his needs. However, people have the right to their feelings and reactions, especially in a relationship where attraction and emotional compatibility are crucial.\n\nThe author's best friend suggests giving the relationship more time, which could be a valid perspective. But if the author is no longer attracted to him and can't see past the trauma to continue the relationship, it's her right to make that choice. However, the act of immediately considering a breakup after such a vulnerable disclosure might be seen as insensitive. The key factors here are support, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often emphasizes that while it's okay to have personal boundaries and feelings, reacting without giving the situation more thought or support might be seen as wrong. The author's immediate reaction of leaving and considering a breakup might not consider the boyfriend's need for support during a vulnerable time. However, it's also valid for her to feel that the relationship isn't working for her anymore.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having those feelings, but the way she handled the situation could be seen as lacking empathy. However, given the options A and B, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the focus is on her reaction and not giving support, it might be A. But if the focus is on her right to feel that way, it's B. Given that the boyfriend was in a vulnerable state and she left, it's more likely that the answer is A. However, considering that people can't be forced to stay in a relationship they're uncomfortable in, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B because it's her personal choice and feelings, though it's not the most empathetic approach.\n"
