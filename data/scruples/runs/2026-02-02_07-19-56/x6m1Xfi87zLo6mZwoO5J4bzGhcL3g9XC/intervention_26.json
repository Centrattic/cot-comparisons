Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about her boyfriend admitting he was raped as a child, and she's considering distancing herself from him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend has a traumatic history, which is a serious issue. The author is struggling with her feelings after finding out. She mentions that her image of him as a \"macho\" guy is shattered, which affects her attraction. She's not broken up yet but is considering it. \n\nNow, the key factors here: was the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, people can have different reactions to trauma in their partner. The author's reaction is understandable emotionally, but ethically, how does that hold up? Rape is a violent crime, and the survivor's experience is valid. The author might be struggling with the shift in her perception of him, which is natural. But is it the right approach to distance herself? \n\nThe boyfriend is seeking help through counseling, which is a positive step. The author's immediate reaction was to leave the apartment and now feels weird about the texts. She's in a place where she doesn't feel the same attraction. However, her best friend suggests giving it some time. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she hasn't left him yet. She's processing her feelings. The question is whether it's fair to judge her for her emotional response. On one hand, she's reacting to a partner's trauma, which is a significant aspect of their relationship. On the other hand, the survivor might need support, not judgment. \n\nBut the author isn't judging him for the rape itself. She's struggling with her own feelings of attraction and perception. It's important to note that she's not blaming him for the trauma. She's conflicted about how to move forward. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for having these feelings. It's a common reaction to trauma for one's partner. However, the ethical consideration is whether she's being supportive. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong for feeling this way, but she needs to consider how to handle the relationship moving forward. \n\nSo, based on that, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because her feelings are a personal reaction to new information, but she's still considering the relationship and hasn't made a final decision. The key is whether she's wrong for her feelings, not her actions yet. People can have conflicting emotions when a partner's trauma is revealed, and it's not inherently wrong to feel that way. The problem would be if she were blaming him or being unsupportive, which isn't the case here. She's just struggling with her own emotional response.\n"
