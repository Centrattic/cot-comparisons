Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person writing the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: Her boyfriend confessed to being raped as a child. She felt her image of him shattered and is now distancing herself. She's not sure if she can be attracted to him anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here. The boyfriend had a traumatic experience which is affecting his current behavior. The author's reaction is understandable, but is it wrong?\n\nWell, people react differently to trauma. The boyfriend's experience is valid and serious, but the author's feelings are also real. She's struggling with her attraction and perception of him now. That's a personal struggle. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a black and white issue. The author might not be in the wrong because her feelings are her own. But she might also feel guilty for not being able to accept his past. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's healthy or kind.\n\nThe boyfriend's trauma is a significant part of his identity now. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating his experience if she's dismissing it. But she's not being cruel; she's conflicted. She's still considering continuing the relationship but feels weird now.\n\nThe friend suggests staying for a bit, but the author is struggling. It's about mutual respect. The author isn't attacking him; she's just having trouble adjusting her perception. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe she should be more supportive. But again, it's her feelings. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), usually if someone is reacting to a serious issue, but their reaction is self-centered or harmful, they might be the asshole. Here, she's not acting maliciously. She's trying to process. So perhaps she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
