Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend, who's 24, was raped at 11 by his stepbrother. He's been having trouble with performance issues, which led to him opening up about this. The woman, 20, felt her perception of him changed because he was someone she thought of as \"macho\" but now has this traumatic past. She left after he broke down, and now she's not sure she can be attracted to him anymore. They're not broken up yet, but she's considering it.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFrom what I know about trauma and relationships, when someone shares something deeply personal like being a rape survivor, it's a significant moment. The woman here is struggling with her feelings. She might have feelings of shock, maybe some guilt, but she's not necessarily the asshole. She's reacting to a new and traumatic revelation that affects her perception. \n\nHowever, the key here is how she's handling it. She left the apartment during a vulnerable moment, and now she's pulling away. The boyfriend might need support, and her reaction could be seen as abandoning him during a time of need. On the other hand, she's also allowed to have emotions and boundaries. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she hasn't broken up with him yet, but she's not giving him much support. She's distancing herself, which could be hurtful. However, her feelings are valid. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she can't be attracted to him anymore after knowing this. \n\nThe boyfriend's trauma is real, but the woman's feelings are also valid. It's a tough spot. From an ethical standpoint, the woman might not be the asshole if she's being honest about her feelings. However, the way she's handling it\u2014leaving during a breakdown and not communicating clearly\u2014might be where the problem is. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The fact that she's not supporting him after such a vulnerable moment could be seen as her being the asshole. But if she's not able to handle it emotionally, maybe she's not at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she's not in the wrong. People have the right to their feelings, and if she can't be in a healthy relationship with him after this, it's not her fault. However, she should communicate her feelings better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about communication. So maybe B is correct.\n"
