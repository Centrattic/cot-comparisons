Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's dating a man she's been with for five months. He's been having trouble performing sexually, and when she asks, he breaks down and tells her he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. She left after that, feeling weird about seeing him the same way, and is considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The man disclosed a traumatic experience, which is rape. The woman is struggling with her feelings towards him after that revelation. She's confused because her image of him as a \"tough guy\" was shattered, leading to emotional distance. Her best friend suggests giving it a bit more time, but she's not feeling the same attraction anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break this down.\n\nRape survivors often go through a lot, and sharing such a traumatic experience can be incredibly vulnerable. It's important to consider how the disclosure affects the relationship dynamics. The woman is reacting by distancing herself, which might be a natural response to unexpected and shocking information. However, it's also crucial to recognize that her reaction might not be malicious. She's not in the wrong for having feelings change upon learning something significant about her partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the man's experience is a serious issue that shouldn't be taken lightly. The woman might be struggling with how to process this information, which is understandable. But is she at fault for not being able to continue the relationship as before? Not necessarily. People have different coping mechanisms. If she's found out the truth and realized it's affecting her ability to be in the relationship, that's a personal decision she's making based on her feelings.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the relationship is only five months old. Some people might adjust, while others might not. Her reaction is about her inability to see him the same way, not a rejection of his worth. So, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own feelings, even if that leads to breaking up.\n\nBut wait, could it be seen as wrong to pull away after he was vulnerable? Maybe, but the key here is that she's not being cruel or dismissive; she's struggling with her emotions. The answer should consider that she's entitled to her feelings, even if they change after such a disclosure. It's not about right or wrong but about personal compatibility and emotional readiness. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here. So the answer would be B.\n"
