Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend finding out her boyfriend was raped as a child and then distancing herself from him. The author is unsure if she's being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which is a significant and sensitive topic. The author felt her image of him changed, affecting her attraction and comfort. She's struggling with how to handle this new information and is considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's human and her reaction is a natural emotional response. Discovering such a deep secret can be shocking and might change perceptions. But on the other hand, the boyfriend was vulnerable sharing his trauma, and her reaction might be seen as dismissive or not supporting him during a tough time. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the author is not being judgmental about the rape itself; she acknowledges it's horrible. Her issue is more about the shift in her perception and attraction. She's conflicted and seeking advice. The key factors here are communication and mutual understanding. The author might need to process this information and decide if she can still be supportive. But acting on that by distancing herself could be seen as a natural response rather than wrongdoing. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault for having emotional reactions. People have different capacities to handle partners' traumas. The boyfriend's stepbrother raped him, which is a serious issue he's dealing with. The author's reaction isn't about blaming him but about her own feelings. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for feeling this way, especially since she's not invalidating his experience. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
