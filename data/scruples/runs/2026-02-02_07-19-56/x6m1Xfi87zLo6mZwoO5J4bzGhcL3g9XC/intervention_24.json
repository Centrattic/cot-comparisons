Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is 24, they've been dating for 5 months. He's been having trouble performing sexually, and he breaks down and tells her about being raped by his stepbrother when he was 11. The author felt her image of him as a \"macho\" guy shattered and now feels weird about texting him. She considered breaking up, and her friend thinks she should try to stay with him.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, she's going through a natural reaction to such a shocking revelation. It's understandable that it might change her perception of him, especially if she had an idealized image. Her feelings might be genuine; she might not be able to get past that now. On the other hand, he's sharing something deeply personal and traumatic, which takes courage. The author's response of leaving and distancing herself could be seen as invalidating his experience or not supporting him during a vulnerable moment. \n\nBut the key here is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate. Is it wrong to feel uncomfortable after learning about a trauma that changes how you see your partner? Or is it wrong to not support him after he's been vulnerable? \n\nAlso, the timing: they've only been dating for 5 months. Relationships at that stage can be more fragile. If the author's feelings are genuine and she's not able to move past it, maybe it's not her fault. But maybe she should give it more time, try to work through it, especially since he's seeking therapy. \n\nHowever, it's also important to respect one's own feelings. If she's not attracted to him anymore and feels weird, forcing the relationship might not be healthy for either. But she might feel guilty for leaving him after he opened up. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's being honest about her feelings and isn't able to support him emotionally, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's judging him for being a rape victim, then yes. But the post doesn't indicate she's judging his trauma; she's just struggling with the changed perception. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it's her emotional response to a new and shocking piece of information. She's not blaming him, just struggling with the shift in her feelings. It's not her fault for feeling that way, though she might need to communicate better with him.\n"
