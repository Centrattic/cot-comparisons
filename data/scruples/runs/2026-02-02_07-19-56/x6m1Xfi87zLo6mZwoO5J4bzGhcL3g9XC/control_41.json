Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who disclosed being raped as a child, and the author is struggling with their feelings after that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend has a traumatic past, which he shared with the author. The author is now feeling disconnected, not as attracted, and considering ending the relationship. The main question is whether the author is at fault for wanting to distance herself after learning this.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reaction. She felt her image of him shattered, feels weird when he texts her, and isn't as attracted. The friend thinks she should try to stay in the relationship, but she's not sure. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for considering this.\n\nI need to consider empathy here. Survivors of trauma often struggle with relationships, especially when they disclose such personal information. The author's reaction isn't uncommon, but it's important to consider how the boyfriend is handling it. If he's in therapy, that's a positive step. However, the author's feelings of discomfort and loss of attraction might indicate that the relationship isn't healthy for either of them. \n\nBut wait, is it her fault for feeling that way? People have different reactions to trauma disclosures. Some might stay, others might not. The key is whether she's being unfair by not supporting him. But if she's not emotionally equipped to handle this, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, walking away after someone is vulnerable could be seen as insensitive. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether she's being cruel vs. honest. If she's not able to be supportive and is distancing herself, that could be seen as wrong. But if she's being truthful about her feelings and not pressuring him, maybe it's okay. The post says she left after he was in tears, but maybe she should have stayed and discussed it. However, everyone has the right to their feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's her right to feel that way, but she should communicate clearly. Alternatively, A if she's being dismissive. I'm a bit torn, but I think in the context of AITA, the community often considers leaving after trauma disclosure as not the wrong, because it's about personal feelings and compatibility.\n"
