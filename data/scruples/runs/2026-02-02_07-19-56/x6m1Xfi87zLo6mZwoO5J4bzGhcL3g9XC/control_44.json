Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend admitted he was raped as a child, and she's feeling distant now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which is significant. The woman is now struggling with how she views him, especially since she had certain expectations or an image of him as \"macho\" or dominant. She's experiencing a loss of attraction and considering breaking up.\n\nThe question is about whether she's at fault. In relationships, when someone shares something deeply personal like trauma, it's important to provide support. However, people's reactions can vary. The woman is feeling conflicted, which is a natural human response. She's not rejecting him for not being okay, but for a change in her perception and attraction. \n\nBut is that her fault? Well, she's in a vulnerable situation herself. Her feelings are valid, even if she's struggling to adjust. However, the key point is whether she's in the wrong for her reaction. The boyfriend was honest, and she's trying to process this. Ending a relationship because someone has a traumatic past isn't necessarily \"wrong,\" but it's complicated. The answer would depend on the dynamics of their relationship and the support system.\n\nHowever, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If someone is honest about their past trauma and the other person can't handle it, it's not the person with the trauma who's at fault. The woman is allowed to feel conflicted, but if she can't move past it, it's more about compatibility. But in terms of right or wrong, maybe she's not in the wrong for her feelings, but perhaps she should consider if she's giving him enough support. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's not rejecting him for not being okay, but for her own feelings, the answer might lean towards B (No), but I need to be careful. The answer isn't about whether she's justified in her feelings, but if she's in the wrong for her actions. Since she's not doing anything malicious, like blaming him, but is struggling to adjust, the answer might be B. However, some might argue that she should work through it, but the question is about being in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
