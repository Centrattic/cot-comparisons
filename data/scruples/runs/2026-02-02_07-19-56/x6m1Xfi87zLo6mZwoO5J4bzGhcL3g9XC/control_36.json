Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a woman in a 5-month relationship) is in the wrong for distancing herself after her boyfriend revealed he was raped as a child. The boyfriend is 24, described as dominant, macho, and they have a good sex life, but recently he had performance issues. He broke down and told her about the rape, which shocked her because it didn't fit her image of him. She left after he cried and now feels weird seeing his texts, considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's disclosure is a significant trauma. Rape survivors often face stigma, especially when the perpetrator is male. The author's reaction might stem from the conflict between her previous perception of him as a \"tough guy\" and the reality of his trauma. Her friend thinks she should stay, but she's lost attraction. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not being judgmental about his experience; he's the victim here. The issue is her reaction to the trauma affecting their relationship. People react differently when a partner's trauma changes how they see them. She's not blaming him or dismissing his trauma. She's struggling with her feelings but hasn't ended the relationship yet. \n\nIn relationships, communication and support are key. However, if someone's trauma leads to a loss of attraction or emotional distance, that's a personal struggle. The author isn't shaming him; she's dealing with her own emotions. It's possible she needs time to adjust, but if she can't move past it, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. So, maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. But some might argue she should be more supportive. However, the key point is that she's not at fault for having a hard time adjusting, especially since the trauma is affecting her perception. So, B.\n"
