Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is dealing with a traumatic past, which he's only now starting to process with therapy. He confided in her about his rape, which is a significant and vulnerable act. The woman's reaction was to leave the apartment and now she's not as attracted to him, considering breaking up.\n\nI should think about how traumatic experiences affect people. Rape is a severe trauma, and the victim might experience various emotional and psychological effects, including issues with intimacy or performance. The man's performance issues could be related to his trauma. The woman's reaction might be a result of shock, discomfort, or a shift in her perception of him. It's important to note that she's in a relatively new relationship (5 months), so the bond might not be as deep as in longer relationships. \n\nHowever, distancing herself after such a vulnerable confession could be seen as not supportive. The man was in tears and needed emotional support. Her immediate reaction of leaving and then considering a breakup might be hurtful. On the other hand, it's also valid for her to process her feelings and reassess the relationship, especially if her attraction has diminished. People have different thresholds for coping with partners' traumas, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. \n\nBut the key point here is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not willing to support him through his healing process, that could be seen as the issue. However, if her reaction is genuine and she's trying to understand her feelings, it's more about personal compatibility rather than moral wrong. The question is whether she's at fault for her emotional response. \n\nThe answer might hinge on the idea that while her reaction is understandable, choosing to distance or end the relationship right after such a confession might lack the support he needs. But it's also her right to feel how she does. So, is she in the wrong? If the problem is that she's not supporting him after he was vulnerable, then yes. But if it's about her genuine feelings, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because people can't be forced to feel attraction or support if those feelings have genuinely changed. However, she might need to communicate better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. Since she's processing her feelings, it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
