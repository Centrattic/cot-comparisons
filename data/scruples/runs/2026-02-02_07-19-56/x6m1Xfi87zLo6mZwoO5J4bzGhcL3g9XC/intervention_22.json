Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend admitting he was raped as a child, leading the author to distance themselves and consider breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a 20-year-old woman in a five-month relationship with a 24-year-old boyfriend. He's been having performance issues in bed, which he attributes to being raped as an 11-year-old. The author feels uncomfortable, their attraction has waned, and they're considering ending the relationship. The best friend suggests staying, but the author is conflicted.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for distancing herself. Let's break it down. Rape is a traumatic experience, and the boyfriend is seeking therapy, which is a positive step. The author's reaction is to leave the apartment and feel weird about texting him. She mentions her image of him being shattered, which suggests she had certain expectations of him as a \"tough guy,\" which the truth contradicted. This could indicate a conflict between her preconceived notions and his reality.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, trauma can affect relationships. The boyfriend's disclosure is significant, and it's part of his healing process. However, the author's response is to distance herself, which might be a natural reaction if she's struggling with the new information. But is that her fault? Emotional reactions are often complex. People might feel shocked or unsure how to handle such a serious revelation, leading to withdrawal.\n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If we consider that the boyfriend's experience is valid and that the author is reacting to it by distancing, does that make her wrong? Or is it a matter of personal boundaries and emotional response? It's important to note that everyone processes trauma and disclosures differently. The author might not be at fault for feeling this way, but there's also a responsibility to communicate and work through these feelings, especially if the relationship is to continue.\n\nThe author's best friend suggests giving it a bit more time, which is a common advice in such situations. However, the author is no longer attracted, which complicates things. Attraction is a significant factor in relationships. If the emotional connection is broken, it's hard to sustain the relationship. But is it wrong to end it because of that? Not necessarily. People have different capacities to adjust to their partner's past.\n\nAnother angle is empathy. The author might feel conflicted between understanding his trauma and her own discomfort. It's possible she's struggling with internalized stigma around male victims of sexual abuse, which could contribute to her discomfort. Acknowledging that as a societal issue might shift the perspective\u2014perhaps the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's a need for more education and compassion.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, being in the wrong usually implies a deliberate or negligent action. If the author is acting based on genuine emotional responses and not malice, then it's more about personal challenges than being wrong. However, if she's dismissing his feelings or invalidating his experience, that's different. The scenario doesn't indicate that she's blaming him or being cruel; she's just struggling with the change in perception.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction is a natural human response to unexpected and traumatic information versus a failure to support her partner. Since the author is experiencing a change in attraction and comfort, which are valid feelings, and there's no indication of her being cruel or dismissive, it's more about personal difficulty in the relationship rather than being in the wrong. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but it's a complex situation where both parties need to communicate their needs.\n"
