Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend, who is 24, was raped when he was 11 by his stepbrother. He recently started therapy and had trouble performing sexually, which led him to break down and share this with his girlfriend. She felt shocked because she had an image of him as a \"macho\" person and now finds it hard to see him the same way. She left his apartment and isn't as attracted to him anymore. The question is whether she's at fault for distancing herself.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend's traumatic past, the girlfriend's reaction, and the dynamics of their relationship. \n\nOn one hand, being a rape victim is a serious traumatic experience, and it's important for the survivor to have support. The girlfriend initially offered comfort, but then distanced herself. She's considering breaking up because her attraction has diminished. \n\nOn the other hand, it's not uncommon for people to have a hard time adjusting after learning something deeply personal about a partner, especially something that challenges their perception. However, the boyfriend's trauma is valid, and the girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her own biases or misconceptions. For example, she might have internalized certain stereotypes about masculinity or male survivors of sexual violence, making it hard for her to reconcile that with her previous view of him.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? In relationships, both partners need to work through challenges. However, if one partner is unable to support the other through significant issues, that can be a problem. The girlfriend is struggling with her feelings post-revelation, which is understandable. But the key is whether her reaction is fair or if she's placing an unfair burden on her partner.\n\nI think it's a complex situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, as it's a personal struggle. However, the issue is whether she's handling it with consideration for her partner's needs. If she's distancing herself without trying to understand or support him, that could be problematic. But if she's honestly struggling and seeking advice, maybe she's not entirely wrong. The answer might hinge on whether she's being dismissive or genuinely conflicted.\n\nBut considering that the boyfriend is in therapy and the girlfriend is struggling with her image of him, it's more about her personal adjustment. The question is whether the blame lies with her for not accepting his history. In that case, maybe she's not in the wrong, because trauma responses vary. However, if she's using the disclosure as a reason to end the relationship without trying to support him, that's different. Since the situation is still ongoing and she's considering it, it's a bit of a gray area. But overall, I lean towards her not being in the wrong because it's her reaction to a traumatic revelation, and people have different capacities to handle such things.\n"
