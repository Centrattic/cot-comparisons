Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped as a child. So, the user wants a simple A or B answer. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The boyfriend, who's 24, has been acting a certain way\u2014dominant, macho\u2014and then confesses to being raped at 11 by his stepbrother. The author, 20, feels her image of him shattered, can't be attracted to him anymore, and is considering breaking up. Her friend says to try to stay, but she's not sure.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the situation is sensitive. The boyfriend has a traumatic past that's affecting his current behavior. The author is reacting emotionally because the revelation changes her perception of him. But is that her fault? Everyone has the right to their feelings. However, the key is whether she's being unjust in her reaction. \n\nHe was open with her about a traumatic experience, which is hard to do. Her immediate reaction is to distance herself, leaving during his moment of vulnerability. That might be seen as insensitive. But she's also human; she might need time to process, especially if it affects her attraction. \n\nBut the question is about right or wrong. The man's history doesn't obligate her to continue the relationship. However, reacting with distance right after he's vulnerable could be seen as not supportive. But again, she's allowed to feel uncomfortable and need space. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for her reaction. Since she's allowing her feelings to dictate the relationship's future, and she's not forcing the breakup yet, maybe she's not in the wrong. The problem is not in her feelings but in how she's handling them. She's in a tough spot, and it's okay to need time. So the answer might be B\u2014not in the wrong. But if she's being dismissive without trying to understand, maybe A. But the story says she tried to comfort him. So B seems right. She's processing her feelings, which is normal.\n"
