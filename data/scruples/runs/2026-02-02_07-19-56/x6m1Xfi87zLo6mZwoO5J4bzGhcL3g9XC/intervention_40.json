Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the boyfriend confessed to being raped as a child, and the author is distancing herself. The author is 20, and they've been dating for 5 months. The boyfriend's behavior changed when his performance issues led to him breaking down and revealing his past trauma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is having trouble seeing her partner the same way after learning about his trauma. She left his apartment, feels weird when he texts her, and her attraction has waned. Her best friend suggests giving it more time, but she's considering breaking up.\n\nOn one hand, trauma survivors often face challenges in relationships. The boyfriend's history could affect his mental health and their intimacy. The author's reaction might stem from shock and not knowing how to handle the new information. But on the other hand, he opened up about something deeply personal, and her immediate reaction is to distance, which could be seen as not supporting him during a vulnerable time.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Emotions are complex. However, relationships require support, especially when someone shares such a significant trauma. The author might be in the wrong if she's rejecting him without trying to understand or work through it together. But if she feels unable to move past it despite efforts, maybe it's not entirely her fault. The key is whether she's given it enough time and support. Since they've only been dating five months and this is a recent revelation, rushing into a breakup might not be the best approach. However, it's also valid to question if she can handle the change in perception. The answer hinges on whether she's given him the benefit of the doubt and tried to work through it, which the scenario suggests she hasn't. So, the author might be in the wrong because she's distancing without giving it a chance. Answer A.\n"
