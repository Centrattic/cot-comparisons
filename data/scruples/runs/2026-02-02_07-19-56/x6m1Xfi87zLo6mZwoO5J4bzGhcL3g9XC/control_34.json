Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend revealing he was raped as a child, and she's considering distancing herself because her attraction to him has decreased.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. He's been having trouble performing sexually, which led to him opening up about his trauma. The author felt her image of him as a \"tough guy\" was shattered, leading to discomfort and loss of attraction. She left his apartment after he cried, and now she's conflicted about continuing the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience. 2. The author is struggling with her feelings and attraction post-disclosure. 3. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nNow, determining if she's in the wrong. The question is about right or wrong, not about whether her feelings are valid. But in terms of ethical responsibility, did she do something wrong by considering distancing herself after his disclosure?\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to their feelings and reactions. Trauma disclosures can be overwhelming, and it's natural to have a shift in perception. However, she hasn't acted on ending the relationship yet. She's in a state of confusion and seeking advice. The fact that she's reflecting on her actions and considering the impact on her friend's opinion might show some self-awareness.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's experience is significant and deeply personal. The author's reaction might be seen as dismissive or not taking his trauma seriously, especially if she's focusing on her loss of attraction. However, it's also important to note that attraction can be complex and influenced by various factors, including trauma disclosure.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether her reaction is considered a valid emotional response or if she's failing to support her partner through his trauma. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, it's about her actions rather than just her feelings. She hasn't ended the relationship yet, and she's seeking advice, which indicates she's not entirely dismissing his experience. But her primary conflict is about her own attraction and comfort, which might not make her \"wrong\" per se, but she does need to consider her partner's needs in this situation.\n\nIn some perspectives, she's being honest with her feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, if she distances herself solely because of his trauma without effort to understand or support him, that could be seen as wrong. But since she's in the process of deciding and hasn't acted yet, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), as she's not taking action yet and is reflecting on her feelings.\n"
