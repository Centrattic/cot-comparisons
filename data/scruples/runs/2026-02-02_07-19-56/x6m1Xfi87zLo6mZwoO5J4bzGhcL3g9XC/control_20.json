Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend told her he was raped as a child, and she's distancing herself. She's feeling weird about seeing him the same way because her image of him changed. Her friend says she should keep dating him, but she's losing attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend opened up about a traumatic experience. That's a big deal. He was vulnerable, and she was there to hold him. But then she left after the conversation. The problem is, she's now distancing herself. Is that wrong? Well, it's her right to feel uncomfortable, right? But maybe she's not handling it the best way.\n\nWait, the boyfriend was raped by his stepbrother as a kid. That's a serious trauma. He's dealing with it, seeing a therapist. The author might be struggling with seeing him as a victim now instead of the \"tough guy\" image she had. But does that make her wrong? Maybe not. Everyone reacts differently to such information. But the key point is whether she's in the wrong for distancing herself. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend entrusted her with a personal secret. If she's pulling away because of that, it might be unfair to him. He might need support, not rejection. On the other hand, she's allowed to feel shocked and need time to process. It's not like she's maliciously cutting him off. She's confused and maybe not ready to move forward. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. The main issue here is her reaction. She's not saying she's abusive or that she's doing something harmful, just that she's struggling with the change in perception. So maybe it's not her fault, but maybe she should work on it. However, being in a relationship requires both parties to work through issues. If she's not attracted and feels weird, it's a problem. But is she wrong for feeling that way? Probably not. People have their limits. \n\nAlternatively, by distancing herself after he was vulnerable, is she being selfish? Maybe. But again, it's her emotional response. It's not necessarily wrong, but it's a problem for the relationship. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because she's reacting to a traumatic disclosure and is processing it. It's not her fault she feels that way, though she might need to communicate better.\n"
