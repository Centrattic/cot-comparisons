Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 20-year-old woman who's been dating her 24-year-old boyfriend for five months. He's been having trouble performing sexually, and when she asks, he confesses to being raped at 11 by his stepbrother. She left after he broke down and is now conflicted about continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The boyfriend revealed a traumatic experience from his past, which is a significant and vulnerable moment. The author admits that her perception of him as a \"tough guy\" has been shattered, leading to her not feeling attracted to him anymore. She's considering ending the relationship but isn't sure if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's disclosure, the author's reaction, and the question of moral responsibility. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. \n\nWhen someone shares a traumatic experience, especially something like being a rape victim, it's a sensitive moment. The author's response was to leave and now considering ending the relationship. While it's understandable that this revelation might affect her feelings, the boyfriend has done nothing wrong by sharing his past. The author is struggling with her attraction and perception, which isn't necessarily about right or wrong but more about compatibility and emotional readiness.\n\nHowever, the author is not in the wrong for feeling this way. People have varying emotional responses to such disclosures, and it's not fair to label her as \"in the wrong\" for feeling uncomfortable or having her attraction diminished. That said, it's important to consider the context of their relationship being only five months long. They might not have a strong enough foundation to navigate such a significant issue together. The author's decision to step back could be a sign of self-awareness, recognizing that the relationship might not work given her current feelings, rather than a malicious act.\n\nThe boyfriend's trauma should not be a barrier to the author's comfort, and she's not obligated to continue the relationship if she's not emotionally prepared. So, in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about whether her actions were insensitive or unfair. Since she was trying to process the information and left the situation without immediate judgment, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the question is whether she's at fault. The answer might be B (No), because it's a personal and complex emotional reaction, not a clear-cut moral failing. However, she might be questioned about her responsibility to support him or work through it. But given that the relationship is new and her feelings are genuine, she's not in the wrong.\n"
