Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the boyfriend disclosed being raped as a child, and the author is now distancing herself. She's feeling weird about it and considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend shared a very personal and traumatic experience. That's a significant moment in a relationship. The author's reaction is understandable because such a revelation can change one's perception. But the key here is whether her reaction is justified or if she's at fault.\n\nRape is a serious trauma, and survivors often face stigma. The boyfriend might have felt vulnerable after sharing this. The author left during the conversation, which could be seen as a withdrawal of support. On the other hand, people have different ways of processing such information. She might be struggling with her feelings, especially if her initial image of him was different.\n\nHer best friend suggests staying in the relationship, but the author is no longer attracted. Is that a valid reason? Attraction can be affected by new knowledge about a partner. But the question is about being in the wrong. Did she handle it poorly? Leaving him during his breakdown could be seen as insensitive. However, she might not have been ready to process it at that moment.\n\nThe answer isn't black and white. But the core issue is whether the author is wrong for distancing herself. Survivors of trauma deserve support, but the author's reaction is a personal struggle. Some might say she's not wrong because it's a natural reaction, while others might think she should give it more time. The key is that the author's feelings are valid, but she might need to communicate better with her boyfriend instead of distancing. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as her reaction is a personal struggle rather than a moral failing.\n"
