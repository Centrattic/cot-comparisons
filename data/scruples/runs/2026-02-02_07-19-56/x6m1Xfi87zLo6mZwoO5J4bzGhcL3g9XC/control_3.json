Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating her boyfriend for 5 months. He recently told her he was raped as an 11-year-old, and she's struggling with how to handle it. She's feeling weird and not as attracted to him anymore, and she left during the conversation. Her best friend thinks she should try to keep dating him, but she's considering breaking up. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend shared a traumatic experience. The woman's initial reaction was shock because he seemed \"macho\" and dominant, which contrasts with the revelation. She tried to support him but ended up leaving. Now she's feeling emotionally distant and less attracted. \n\nThe key points here are her emotional response and how she handled it. When someone shares such a sensitive issue, the immediate reaction of the partner is important. She did hold him and let him vent, but left the apartment. Leaving could be seen as not being fully supportive in that moment. However, her feelings of discomfort and changed perception might be a normal reaction to reevaluating the relationship after such a big revelation.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, it's a personal decision. She's not obligated to continue the relationship just because he shared his trauma. However, her reaction could be seen as lacking support, especially since he was vulnerable. But considering she's not the one who caused the trauma, and her feelings are valid, it's more about whether her actions were wrong. \n\nThe options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). In these types of situations, people often debate whether the partner's reaction is valid. Since the woman is processing a major change in her view of her partner, her decision to distance herself isn't inherently wrong. She's not at fault for feeling that way. The wrong would be if she had dismissed his experience or blamed him, but she didn't. She left the situation but later is considering breaking up, which is a personal choice. So the answer is B.\n"
