Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend confesses to being raped as a child, and the narrator distances herself. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which is a big moment in any relationship. The narrator felt their image of him changed, leading to discomfort and reduced attraction. The key points here are how the narrator responded and whether their reaction is justified.\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is at fault. On one hand, the boyfriend's trauma is serious, and the narrator left during a vulnerable moment. That might be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, the narrator is struggling with their feelings and attraction, which is a personal issue. They didn't confront the boyfriend but are considering breaking up. \n\nThe boyfriend's disclosure might have been a turning point. The narrator's immediate reaction was to leave, which could be hurtful. However, the narrator is also dealing with a shift in perception. The best friend advised to give it time, but the narrator isn't feeling the same attraction. \n\nIn relationships, how people handle trauma and disclosure is crucial. The narrator might need to process their feelings, but distancing immediately could be seen as not supporting their partner during a vulnerable time. However, it's also valid for someone to realize they're not compatible after such a revelation. \n\nThe challenge is balancing empathy for the boyfriend's trauma with the narrator's emotional response. The answer hinges on whether the narrator's reaction was selfish or a genuine reaction to a changed perspective. Since the narrator left during the confession and isn't supportive right away, it might be seen as wrong. But if they're struggling with their feelings, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points.\n\nThe options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the immediate distancing and the impact on the boyfriend's emotional state, it might lean towards A. However, the narrator's struggle with attraction is a personal matter. The answer isn't straightforward, but the act of leaving during a vulnerable moment could be seen as wrong. So, maybe A.\n"
