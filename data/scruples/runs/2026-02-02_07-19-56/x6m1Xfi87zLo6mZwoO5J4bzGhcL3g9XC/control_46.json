Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped as a child. The boyfriend is dominant, works in marketing, and the woman found out he was raped by his stepbrother when he was 11. She felt her image of him shattered and now feels weird when he texts her. Her friend thinks she should try to keep dating him, but she's not as attracted anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which is a significant moment in a relationship. He was crying and vulnerable, which shows he trusted her. The woman's reaction is to distance herself, which could be seen as a natural response to such a shocking revelation. However, she's still in the early stages of the relationship (5 months), so maybe she's processing the information and not sure how to handle it.\n\nOn one hand, it's normal for people to have different reactions when someone they see as \"macho\" reveals vulnerability. The woman might be struggling with the new information affecting her perception of him. On the other hand, he shared something deeply personal, and her immediate reaction was to leave, which could hurt him. But he hasn't been in a relationship for long, so maybe she's just conflicted.\n\nThe key points here: Is it fair to expect her to stay in a relationship if she's no longer attracted and feels weird? Trauma can affect someone's behavior and performance in relationships. The woman might not be at fault for realizing this isn't working for her. However, she did ask for advice, so maybe she should reflect on her feelings more before making a decision.\n\nBut the question is about AITA. The answer would depend on whether her reaction is justified. Since she's not repulsed but rather shocked and her attraction is waning, it's a personal choice. The boyfriend's trauma is valid, but that doesn't mean she's wrong for not being able to continue. People have different boundaries and capacities to handle such information. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she's processing the information and it's a new relationship. However, some might argue she should give it more time. But given the context, B seems more appropriate.\n"
