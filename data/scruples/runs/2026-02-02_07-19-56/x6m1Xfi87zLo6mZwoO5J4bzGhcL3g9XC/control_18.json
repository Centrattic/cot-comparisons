Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe user is a 20-year-old woman in a 5-month relationship with her 24-year-old boyfriend. He's described as physically attractive, dominant, and working in a startup. Their sex life was good until recently when he started having performance issues. She asked him about it, and he broke down, revealing he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. He's also seeing a therapist now. After this confession, she left his apartment, and now she's feeling conflicted because her image of him has changed. She's considering breaking up, even though they're not officially broken up yet. Her best friend thinks she should give it a chance, but she's no longer as attracted to him. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. He opened up about a traumatic experience, which is a significant moment. Rape is a serious and traumatic event, and survivors often struggle with its effects on their mental health and relationships. The boyfriend's performance issues could be related to his trauma, which is common. When someone shares something that vulnerable, it's a big step, and it's expected that the partner would offer support.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction is to distance herself. She left during the emotional moment, and now she's feeling weird about his messages. She's considering breaking up because her attraction has diminished. Is that her fault? Well, relationships are built on mutual understanding and support. If she can't handle this revelation and it's affecting her attraction and willingness to be in the relationship, maybe it's not entirely her fault. People have different coping mechanisms, and some might struggle to adjust to such a significant change in their perception of a partner.\n\nBut also, when a partner shares such a vulnerable part of their life, the expectation is that the other partner would be supportive. The fact that she left and is now considering breaking up might be seen as not being supportive, which could be where she's in the wrong. However, it's also valid for her to feel conflicted. She might not have the tools or understanding to support him through this, which isn't her fault. It's possible she's dealing with her own emotions here\u2014maybe she's not ready to handle the emotional burden, or there's a shift in her attraction because of the new information.\n\nThe key factors here are: 1) Did she wrong him by distancing? 2) Is it fair to expect her to stay in the relationship despite her feelings? 3) Is her reaction understandable, or is it a failure to support him?\n\nOn one hand, walking away after such a vulnerable confession could be seen as insensitive. On the other, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she's not emotionally compatible after learning this. People can have different reactions to trauma in their partners. Some might find it strengthens the bond, others might not. It's possible she's in the wrong for not being supportive, but it's also possible she's not in the wrong because she's honest about her feelings. The answer depends on societal expectations of support in relationships versus individual emotional responses.\n\nIn some perspectives, it's the author's responsibility to work through this with him, especially since he was the one who shared the trauma. But if she's genuinely not able to do that, maybe she's not in the wrong for ending things. It's a tough call. The question is whether her reaction is a failure to support, making her in the wrong, or if her feelings are valid, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
