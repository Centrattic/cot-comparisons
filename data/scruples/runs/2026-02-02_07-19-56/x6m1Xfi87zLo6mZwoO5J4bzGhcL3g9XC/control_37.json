Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend disclosed being raped as a child, and the author distances herself, feeling weird and less attracted now. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend has a traumatic past, which he shared with his partner. The author is struggling with her feelings after this revelation. The key points are the boyfriend's disclosure, the author's emotional response, and her decision to distance.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, traumatic experiences like childhood rape can have long-term effects. The boyfriend might be dealing with issues like PTSD, anxiety, or low self-esteem, which could affect their relationship dynamics. However, the author's reaction is also valid because her feelings have changed. She might be experiencing discomfort due to the shift in her perception of him.\n\nEthically, it's important to consider mutual respect and support. The boyfriend shared something deeply personal, which requires empathy and understanding. If the author can't provide that support, it might be a sign that the relationship isn't healthy for either party. However, the author isn't necessarily at fault for having a changed perspective. It's possible she needs time to process this, or that the relationship isn't compatible anymore.\n\nLegally and morally, the author isn't in the wrong for ending a relationship if she feels it's not working. However, the way she handled it\u2014leaving without communication\u2014might be seen as abrupt. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about communication style. Ending a relationship isn't inherently wrong unless there's abuse or manipulation.\n\nThe best friend's advice to keep dating him is common, but compatibility is crucial. If the author's attraction is gone and she can't see things the same way, it's realistic that the relationship might not last. The key is whether she's being unfair by not trying to work through it. However, given the change in her feelings, it's not necessarily her fault for reevaluating the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author's feelings are valid, and it's not wrong to reassess a relationship after such a significant disclosure. The boyfriend's trauma is real, but the author isn't obligated to continue the relationship if it no longer feels right to her. However, the way she left might need more communication, but that's a different aspect. The main question is about being in the wrong, which she isn't.\n"
