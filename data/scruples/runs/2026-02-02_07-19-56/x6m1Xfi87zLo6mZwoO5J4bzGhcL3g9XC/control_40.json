Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend told her he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. The author is a 20-year-old woman who's been dating him for 5 months. She mentions he's dominant, works in a startup, and she likes him. But after he confided in her about the rape, she's been distancing herself, and she's not sure if she can be attracted to him the same way. She's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The boyfriend opened up about a traumatic experience. The author's reaction is to pull away, feeling that her image of him as a \"tough guy\" is shattered. She's feeling weird when he texts her, and her best friend suggests she should try to keep dating him. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, when someone shares a traumatic secret, especially about being a victim of rape, it's a vulnerable moment. The partner's response is crucial. The author held him and let him vent, which is good, but then she left. Her feelings are valid because she's now struggling with attraction and how she sees him. But is she in the wrong for feeling that way?\n\nOn one hand, her reaction could be seen as insensitive because the boyfriend is dealing with trauma. However, people's emotional responses can be complex. She might be experiencing a shift in her perception of him, which is a personal reaction and not necessarily a moral failing. It's possible she's not handling it well, but it's not necessarily her fault. The key is whether she's being cruel or dismissive. She's not denying his experience but is struggling with her feelings. \n\nBut relationships require support during such times. If the author is distancing herself, that could be hurtful. But she hasn't broken up yet. Maybe she's just processing. The question is about being in the wrong, which usually implies a moral judgment. If she's being unkind or not supportive, maybe A. If her reaction is a personal struggle and she's not intentionally harming, maybe B. \n\nI think the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because her feelings are a personal response, and while she could be more supportive, it's not necessarily her fault to feel conflicted after such a revelation. People can have mixed emotions and it's a complex situation. The key is that she's not being malicious, just having difficulty adjusting her perception.\n"
