Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong after their boyfriend told them about being raped.\n\nSo the situation is that the boyfriend, after five months, reveals his history of being raped as a child. The author then distances herself, feels weird seeing him, and is considering breaking up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was vulnerable and shared a traumatic experience. The author's reaction is understandable, but is it wrong? People have different responses to such revelations. The author might be struggling with a change in their perception of their partner. The boyfriend's trauma could affect their relationship dynamics, especially if the author isn't ready to handle it emotionally.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if they feel they can't support their partner's needs. However, immediately distancing and considering breakup might be seen as not giving enough time to adjust. But also, it's their right to prioritize their own emotional state. The key here is whether the author acted out of self-interest or not considering the partner's vulnerability. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions (confiding in her) were brave, and the author's response might be seen as a natural but perhaps hasty reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being able to adjust. Since the author is also dealing with their own emotions and the trauma is recent, it's a complex situation. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should communicate and work through such issues. If the author isn't able to support their partner or adjust their feelings, maybe they're not the right match. But it's not necessarily their fault for feeling that way. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because everyone has different thresholds for handling trauma in a partner, and it's their right to decide if they can continue the relationship.\n"
