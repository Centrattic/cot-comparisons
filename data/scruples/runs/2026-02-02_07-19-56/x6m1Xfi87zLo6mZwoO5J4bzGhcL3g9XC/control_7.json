Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's in a five-month relationship with her boyfriend, who she describes as having a tough guy image. Then he opens up about being raped as a child, and she felt her image of him shattered, leading her to distance herself. She's now wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Her boyfriend shared a traumatic experience from his past. That's a big deal. People often go through a lot of emotions when a partner reveals such personal and painful information. The question is whether her reaction is justified or if she's overreacting.\n\nShe mentions that she felt weird seeing him text her and isn't as attracted to him anymore. That could be part of the trauma response. Sometimes when someone learns about a partner's past trauma, especially one that contradicts their previous perception (like a \"macho\" guy being a victim), it can create cognitive dissonance. She might be struggling with how to reconcile that image.\n\nBut is it her fault? Well, it's important to note that the boyfriend was the one who disclosed his trauma. That's a vulnerable act, and it's not his fault that she's now having feelings of discomfort. However, her distancing herself after that disclosure could be seen as invalidating his experience. On the other hand, she's also allowed to have her feelings change.\n\nThe key here is whether she acted with malice or if she's just having a difficult time adjusting. Since she's considering breaking up but hasn't done so yet, it's possible she's conflicted. The fact that she's seeking advice suggests she's trying to process her emotions rather than being intentionally cruel.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. The sexual performance issues started a week and a half before he broke down. Maybe the trauma is affecting his current behavior, and she's reacting to both the trauma and the sexual issues. She might be projecting her discomfort with the trauma onto the relationship dynamics.\n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since she's not the one who committed a wrongdoing, but her reaction could be seen as dismissive of his trauma. However, people have different thresholds for dealing with such disclosures. She's not obligated to stay in the relationship if she can't adjust, but maybe she should try to work through her feelings with him instead of completely distancing.\n\nThe best friend's advice to try to keep dating him is probably trying to encourage her to work through it. But if she's not attracted anymore, maybe it's not feasible. However, the act of distancing immediately after he's vulnerable might be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut again, it's not necessarily her fault. She's reacting to a situation that's affecting her. The answer might depend on whether her reaction is seen as a natural response to conflict or a failure to support her partner's vulnerability. The options are A for yes (she's wrong) or B for no. Given that she's not malicious, but perhaps not handling it well, but it's not her fault per se, maybe B is the answer. But I need to be careful. The question is if she's in the wrong. If she's in the wrong, answer A. If not, answer B.\n\nI think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because everyone has different reactions, and she's processing this. However, it's important that she communicates with him instead of just distancing. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what she should do next. So B.\n"
