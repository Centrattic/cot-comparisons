Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend revealed he was raped as a child, and she's distancing herself from him. She's confused because she thought he was this tough, macho guy, and now that image is shattered. She's not feeling the same attraction anymore and is considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The boyfriend shared a deeply traumatic experience. That's a significant moment in a relationship. The woman's reaction is to leave the apartment, distance herself, and feel weird when he texts her. Her best friend thinks she should try to stay together, but she's not into him the same way.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a general perspective, when someone shares such a vulnerable part of their life, it's expected that the listener will be supportive. But it's also a personal choice in terms of attraction and feelings. So, is it wrong to feel differently after knowing this about him?\n\nI think it's important to consider that his trauma might be affecting his current behavior, like the performance issues in their sex life. The woman might be struggling with how to process this new information and how it affects her feelings. However, reacting by distancing herself immediately after he's vulnerable could be seen as not supportive. But on the other hand, people have the right to their feelings and attraction.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and communication. If she's not able to handle his vulnerability and it's causing her to lose attraction, maybe that's a relationship issue. But she's not the only one at fault. He might need to be aware that sharing such trauma requires trust, and her reaction might be due to her own insecurities or misconceptions. But the fact that she's considering breaking up because of this could be seen as a problem, as it's a significant test of commitment.\n\nHowever, the fact that she's honest about her feelings and not pretending to be okay with it shows some level of integrity. But it's also possible that she's not giving him the support he needs during his healing process. So, the answer might be that she's partially in the wrong, but the options here are A for yes or B for no. The user initially thought she's in the wrong (A), but I need to decide.\n\nIn the \"AITA\" context, the community often considers if the person's actions were considerate. Her leaving after he was vulnerable might be seen as dismissive, hence AITA. But if she's being honest about her feelings, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that she's distancing herself right after he's in emotional pain might tip the scales towards her being in the wrong.\n"
