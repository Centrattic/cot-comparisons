Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend disclosed he was raped when he was 11 by his stepbrother. The author is confused because he seemed like a \"tough guy\" before, and now she's having trouble seeing him the same way. She's distancing herself, not because of anything he did, but because of his past trauma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was raped as a child, which is a severe and traumatic experience. Survivors of such trauma often face challenges in their relationships because of the stigma or the emotional impact. The author is struggling with her attraction and how she views him now that she knows this. \n\nThe key points here are that the boyfriend did not ask for this, and it's part of his past that he's dealing with. The author is feeling uncomfortable because her previous image of him as \"macho\" conflicts with this new information. But is that her fault? She's having a natural human reaction to new information about someone. \n\nHowever, she's also distancing herself. The question is whether that's wrong. She hasn't broken up with him yet but is considering it. She's not in the wrong for feeling conflicted, right? People have different reactions to trauma disclosures. Some might stay, others might not. But does that make her a bad person? \n\nAlso, the fact that he's in therapy is important. He's working on his issues, which shows he's trying to heal. The author might need to process this information and decide whether she can support him through that. But she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she can't accept that part of him. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she's not being supportive enough. But she's honest about her feelings. Maybe she's in a place where she can't move past this, which isn't her fault. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's dealing with her own emotions and it's not her fault for having difficulty adjusting to this new information. She's not rejecting him for his trauma, but for her own inability to reconcile it with her previous view of him. It's a personal choice, not a moral failing.\n"
