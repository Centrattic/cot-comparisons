Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend opens up about a traumatic experience, which is a significant and vulnerable moment. The author's reaction is one of shock and a loss of attraction, leading her to distance herself. She's confused because she liked his \"macho\" image before, which contrasts with his vulnerability. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, it's important to note that everyone reacts differently to sensitive information. The boyfriend shared a deeply personal trauma, which can be hard for some to process. The woman's feelings might be genuine; she might feel uncomfortable or unable to adjust her perception of him. However, the key here is whether her reaction is unjustified.\n\nOn one hand, supporting someone through trauma is a big part of a relationship. If she can't provide that support or feels repulsed, it might be fair for her to step back. But on the other hand, she might be letting preconceived notions about masculinity affect her ability to support him. The article is asking if she's in the wrong for distancing herself, so we need to assess if her reaction is fair.\n\nThe question is whether her reaction is valid. If she's unable to reconcile her previous image of him with his trauma, that might not be her fault. People can have biases or expectations they didn't realize they had. However, if she's dismissing his experience or not giving him the support he needs, that could be seen as wrong. But the article says she's confused and doesn't know if she can see him the same way. She's not necessarily rejecting him for the trauma itself but for her own inability to adjust her perception. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often looks at whether the person acted unkindly or without consideration. Here, she's not being malicious, just struggling with her feelings. However, walking away after someone shares such a vulnerable moment can be seen as insensitive. Yet, if her feelings are genuine and she's not pushing him away for something he can't control, it's a personal decision. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her reaction is seen as a natural human response or a failure to support her partner. Given that she's honest about her feelings and hasn't acted abusively, some might say she's not in the wrong. Others might argue that she should try to work through it. But the question is if she's in the wrong, which is a judgment call. Since the answer is A or B, and given that the community often sides with the person having a hard time adjusting, maybe B is the answer here.\n"
