Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a woman distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend admitted to being raped when he was 11. The author was initially attracted to his \"macho\" image but now feels conflicted after learning about his trauma. She's having trouble maintaining attraction and is considering breaking up. Her friend suggests giving it more time, but she's unsure.\n\nNow, the key points here are about empathy, understanding trauma, and how people react to such revelations. Rape is a serious crime, and survivors often face stigma or judgment. The author's reaction could be seen as a natural human response\u2014she's struggling with a changed perception of her partner. However, it's also important to recognize that the boyfriend's experience is his trauma, not the author's fault. \n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's distancing herself because of his past, does that make her wrong? People have different boundaries and comfort levels. The author might be experiencing a shift in her feelings, which isn't unusual when facing someone's deep trauma. However, the way she left the situation and is considering distancing might be seen as dismissive of his pain. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't being cruel; she's conflicted and trying to process her emotions. It's possible that she's not at fault because she's honest about her feelings. But maybe the issue is that she's not giving him enough support, which could be seen as her failing to be a good partner. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" The act of feeling conflicted isn't wrong per se. People can have different reactions. The real issue is whether her actions (distancing, considering breakup) are justified. Since the boyfriend's trauma is valid and the author is struggling with her own feelings, it's more about her personal boundaries rather than her being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Her reaction is a personal struggle with changing perceptions and emotional conflict. It's not her fault that she's having difficulty adjusting, and she's being honest about her feelings. However, it's important for her to communicate openly with her partner about her feelings to find a resolution. But in terms of right or wrong, she's not wrong for feeling this way.\n"
