Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is a 24-year-old with a dominant, \"macho\" image. He works in a startup and has a good-looking appearance. The relationship is five months old. He started having trouble performing sexually, and when asked, he confessed to being raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. The author felt her image of him shattered, leading to her distancing herself. She's unsure if she can be attracted to him anymore and is considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the author's reaction. She's feeling weird when she sees his texts, her attraction has diminished, and she's thinking of breaking up. Her best friend suggests giving it more time, but she's not sure.\n\nI need to consider if her reaction is justified. Rape is a traumatic experience, and the boyfriend's disclosure is significant. However, the author's response is to distance herself, which might be seen as invalidating his experience. But people react differently to trauma in relationships. Some might feel uncomfortable or unsure how to handle it, leading to emotional withdrawal.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend was honest about his past. The author's reaction might stem from preconceived notions of his \"macho\" image conflicting with his vulnerability. Rape survivors often face stigma, and the author's reaction could inadvertently contribute to that stigma by not supporting him during a vulnerable moment.\n\nHowever, it's also valid to experience a shift in attraction or comfort after such a revelation. Relationships can be complex, and personal boundaries and feelings are important. The key is whether her reaction is dismissive or a natural response to a significant change in understanding someone's past.\n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often looks for empathy and understanding. The author might not be in the wrong if she's processing this information and realizing it's affecting their relationship. But if she's being dismissive of his trauma, then she could be in the wrong. \n\nSince she's seeking advice, the answer likely hinges on whether her reaction is seen as a legitimate struggle with new information or an unjustified judgment. Her acknowledging his trauma but still feeling uncomfortable is a common human reaction, but it's important to handle it with care and communication. The fact that she didn't immediately break up but is considering it might show she's trying to process it rather than being in the wrong.\n"
