Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her about being raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is 24, they've been dating five months. He's been having trouble performing sexually, and he opens up about being raped by his stepbrother when he was 11. The woman felt her image of him was shattered because he seemed so \"macho\" before, and now she's not as attracted to him. She left during the conversation and is considering breaking up.\n\nSo the main question is: Is she wrong for reacting this way? The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the emotional impact of such a confession. Rape is a traumatic experience, and disclosing it to a partner is a big step. The man was vulnerable, crying, and the woman, while supportive, left and is struggling with attraction. \n\nBut trauma can affect intimacy and relationships in complex ways. The woman's reaction might be a personal struggle with her perception of her partner. However, dismissing someone after they've shared such a vulnerable part of their life could be seen as invalidating their experience. Yet, her feelings of attraction are real and might be causing her distress.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. The man's disclosure was a traumatic experience. 2. The woman's reaction is due to changed perception and loss of attraction. 3. They've only been dating 5 months, so the relationship's stage might influence how this is handled.\n\nIt's possible that her reaction isn't entirely her fault, as people have different coping mechanisms. However, walking away immediately after such a vulnerable moment could be hurtful. The answer might depend on the balance between respecting his vulnerability and her own feelings. \n\nThe answer might lean towards B (not wrong) because people have different responses to trauma and relationships, but some might argue A (wrong) because supporting a partner through such a confession is important. But the woman isn't rejecting his trauma, just her own feelings. It's a tough call, but I think B makes more sense here.\n"
