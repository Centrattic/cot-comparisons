Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend is a 24-year-old marketing guy, they've been dating five months. He was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. When he admitted this, the author left his apartment and now feels weird when he texts her. She's considering breaking up.\n\nThe user's question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider several factors. The author's reaction is a personal one. She's not at fault for having feelings or reactions, but maybe the way she handled it. She left immediately after he broke down, which might be seen as not supportive. However, her reaction is also valid because this is a traumatic revelation. People can have different responses to such news.\n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship is five months. It's possible she's not ready to handle this aspect of his past, which could indicate that the relationship isn't a good fit for her. But is that her fault? She's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she can't handle it. \n\nHer best friend suggests giving it more time, but she's not feeling the same attraction. Maybe the problem is more about compatibility rather than her being in the wrong. The question is whether her decision to distance herself is wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, she's not at fault for her feelings. However, if she left immediately without communication, that might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, she's allowed to feel uncomfortable. The key is that the author is honest about her feelings and considering the breakup, which is not necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). She's not obligated to stay, but she might be expected to handle the breakup more thoughtfully. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, and since her reaction is a personal choice, the answer leans towards B.\n"
