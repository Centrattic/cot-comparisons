Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a 20-year-old woman in a 5-month relationship with her 24-year-old boyfriend. He's described as tall, muscular, blonde, blue-eyed, dominant, and works at a startup. They have a good sex life, but recently he's been having performance issues. She asks him about it, he breaks down and tells her he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother, and he's been in therapy for his childhood. He was emotional and clung to her, but she left his apartment. Now she's feeling weird about receiving his texts and considering ending the relationship. Her best friend thinks she should keep dating him, but she's lost attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The boyfriend has a traumatic past, which is affecting his current behavior and relationship. The author is struggling with how to handle this. She left during a vulnerable moment, which might be seen as insensitive. But she's also having a hard time adjusting to this new information and her feelings of attraction have diminished. \n\nIt's important to recognize that being a survivor of childhood sexual abuse is a serious issue. The boyfriend's emotional breakdown and need to vent were significant. The author's immediate reaction was to leave, which might have been a self-protective move, but it could have been hurtful. However, her feelings post-confession are complex. She might be experiencing a conflict between her previous image of him as a \"tough guy\" and the reality of his trauma. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for distancing herself. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the boyfriend's trauma is real and needs respect and support. If she's not able to support him, maybe the relationship isn't sustainable. But if she's reacting out of shock or discomfort and hasn't given it time, that's a different angle. The key points are her reaction, the boyfriend's vulnerability, and her ongoing feelings. \n\nThe author's best friend suggests giving it more time, which might be valid. However, the author's personal feelings of attraction are a factor. If she's not attracted to him anymore, maybe it's not fair to stay just out of guilt. But she did leave during a critical moment of vulnerability, which could be seen as not being there for him when he needed support. \n\nI need to weigh the importance of supporting someone through trauma versus the right to personal feelings and attraction. The boyfriend's experience is valid, and the author's reaction might be a natural response to the shock. However, distancing immediately after such a confession could be harmful. It's possible she needs to reflect on whether her reaction is based on prejudice or a genuine need to step back for her own well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough spot. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if she's struggling with her emotions, but she could be at fault for not being there for her partner during a time of crisis. However, relationships are about mutual support and compatibility. If the trauma is affecting their dynamic and she's not able to move past it, maybe it's a matter of personal compatibility rather than right or wrong.\n"
