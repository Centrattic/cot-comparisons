Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is 24, muscular, dominant, and has been in a relationship with the author for 5 months. He started having trouble performing during sex, which led to him opening up about being raped as an 11-year-old. The author felt her image of him shattered and is now struggling with attraction. Her friend suggests giving it time, but she's considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key here is understanding the impact of trauma disclosure in a relationship. When someone shares such a deeply personal and traumatic experience, especially one that's stigmatized, it's a significant moment. The author's reaction is to distance herself, which might be a natural emotional response. However, relationships require support, especially when dealing with trauma.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of her not being able to see him the same way. Rape is a crime, and the fact that the victim is male adds another layer. The author might be dealing with internal conflicts about his masculinity or her own biases. It's possible she's not in the wrong because everyone has different emotional responses. However, relationships also require work. If she can't get past this, maybe it's a deal-breaker.\n\nOn the other hand, distancing immediately after such a vulnerable moment could be seen as not being supportive. But the author might not yet know if she can adjust to this new understanding. The therapist might help her process her feelings. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because people have different reactions, and it's okay to need time to process. However, if she's not making an effort to understand and support him, that could be a problem. The key is whether she's being dismissive or just taking time. The question is whether her reaction is unfair. Since she's honest about her feelings and hasn't broken up yet, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
