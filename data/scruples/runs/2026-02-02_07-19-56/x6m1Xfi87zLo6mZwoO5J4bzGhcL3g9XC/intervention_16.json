Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the woman (the author) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped. So first, I need to consider the context.\n\nThe boyfriend is 24, and they've been dating for five months. He was raped when he was 11 by his stepbrother. He started having trouble performing sexually, which led to him opening up about the trauma. The author felt her image of him as a \"macho\" and dominant guy was shattered. She left the apartment after he cried, and now she's feeling weird about communicating with him, considering breaking up.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. When someone shares such a vulnerable part of their past, especially related to trauma, it's a significant moment. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014people have different reactions to such revelations. She might feel conflicted because her initial perception of him as \"tough\" contradicts the trauma he endured. But is it wrong to feel that way?\n\nOn one hand, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she can't handle the emotional impact. It's her right to prioritize her own feelings. On the other hand, the boyfriend is sharing his pain, and her reaction might be dismissive or not supportive. However, the woman is also dealing with her own emotions here. She might need time to process this information and adjust her feelings. The fact that she's considering breaking up but hasn't yet suggests she's trying to be fair.\n\nBut is she wrong for feeling that way? The original poster is asking if they're at fault. In a way, it's not that simple. Everyone has different boundaries and coping mechanisms. The boyfriend's trauma is a part of him now, and if the woman can't accept that, maybe they aren't compatible. But is that her fault? Or is it just a difference in how they handle emotional issues?\n\nAlso, the fact that she's trying to process this and hasn't ended things yet is a point. She's not immediately cutting him off but is struggling. Her friend's advice to try to keep dating him suggests that maybe she's not entirely wrong, but she's also not in the right if she's not giving it a chance.\n\nSo, considering all that, is she in the wrong? The answer might be B (No), because she's dealing with her own emotions and it's a complex situation. People react differently to trauma disclosures. Her reaction isn't malicious; she's honestly trying to reconcile her feelings. It's not about being right or wrong but about compatibility and emotional readiness. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
