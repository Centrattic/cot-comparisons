Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend told her he was raped as a child. The user feels her image of him as a \"tough guy\" is shattered, leading her to distance herself and consider breaking up. She's asking if she's the asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend shared a deeply personal and traumatic experience. This is a significant moment in their relationship. The user's reaction is to leave and feel weird about texting him. Her best friend thinks she should try to stay, but she's not feeling the same attraction.\n\nNow, the question is whether her reaction makes her \"in the wrong.\" Rape is a serious trauma, and the survivor deserves support and understanding. The user's response isn't about judging the survivor but about her own feelings. She's struggling with a shift in her perception of him, which is a personal and emotional reaction.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful to the boyfriend. She's having difficulty adjusting to new information that affects her feelings. However, it's important to consider if her reaction is dismissive or hurtful. She did hold him and let him vent, which shows initial support. But then she left and is now distancing, which might come across as not fully processing the situation.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, people can have mixed reactions to traumatic disclosures. It's possible she's not being intentionally cruel but is struggling with her emotions. The key point is that the wrong here would be if she were blaming the victim or reacting in a harmful way. Since she's not doing that, but rather having a personal emotional response, it's more complicated.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the label \"asshole\" might be too harsh here. People have different coping mechanisms. The author isn't the one who was wronged in the rape; the boyfriend is. The author's feelings are valid, but she might need to work through them. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the act in question is distancing herself, that's a personal choice, not necessarily a moral wrong unless there's intent to harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong because her reaction, while difficult, is a personal emotional response and not a harmful or unjust action towards the victim.\n"
