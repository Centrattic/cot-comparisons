Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the woman in the scenario) is in the wrong for deciding to distance herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which the author wasn't aware of before. The author is now struggling with her feelings towards him, feeling that her previous image of him as a \"tough guy\" has been shattered. She's not in the relationship anymore, but it's not officially broken up yet. Her best friend is advising her to stay, but she's not feeling the same attraction. The author is questioning if she's at fault.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong: In relationships, especially when dealing with trauma disclosures, there are nuances. The boyfriend was vulnerable and honest, which is a significant step in any relationship. The author's reaction is to distance herself, which could be seen as a lack of support or empathy. But on the other hand, humans have the right to their feelings and attractions. It's possible she's experiencing a shift due to new information and emotional changes.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to judge someone's feelings? The author isn't rejecting his trauma but is struggling with how it affects her perception of him. However, distancing herself after such a vulnerable moment might be seen as hurtful. The boyfriend might feel that his trust was broken, or that she didn't support him when he needed it most. Relationships require mutual support, and walking away after someone opens up about such a sensitive issue could be seen as a failure to support a partner in need.\n\nOn the flip side, the author's feelings are valid. People can have unexpected reactions to new information. But the key here is how she handles the situation. If she's honest about her feelings and communicates them, that's different than abruptly distancing without explanation. The fact that she left during the moment he was crying suggests she might not have handled it gently. \n\nAlso, considering the timing and her initial reaction: she left the apartment when he was vulnerable. That could be seen as abandoning him during a crisis. Even if her feelings are genuine, the way she reacted might have caused more harm. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling a certain way. People can't control their emotions. But if she's in a relationship, she should consider how her actions affect the other person. However, the question is whether she's \"in the wrong,\" and \"AITA\" often implies a moral judgment. \n\nBut the author isn't denying his experience or blaming him. She's struggling with her own feelings. So, is that her fault? Or is it just a natural human reaction? In that case, maybe she isn't in the wrong. But if she's choosing to end the relationship without trying to work through it, that could be seen as dismissive. However, the scenario says she's considering it, not that she's already done so. \n\nHmm. The answer might hinge on whether the author is being inconsiderate versus having genuine feelings. The boyfriend's disclosure was a significant moment, and the author's immediate reaction was to leave. That could be hurtful, but the underlying issue is her attraction and perception. \n\nIn many cases, people aren't in the wrong for their feelings. The real question is about how they handle the situation. But the AITA question is asking if the author is in the wrong for choosing to distance herself, not about how she handled it. \n\nGiven the context, the author isn't being malicious. She's dealing with a shift in her perception, which is valid. So maybe she isn't in the wrong. But the way she handled it (leaving during his emotional breakdown) could be problematic. However, the question is about the act of distancing herself, not the method. \n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because people aren't at fault for their feelings, even if they lead to difficult decisions. But some might argue A (in the wrong) because of the lack of support during a vulnerable moment. \n\nI think the correct answer here is B. The author isn't in the wrong for her feelings, even though the situation is complex. However, it's important for her to communicate openly and compassionately if she decides to end the relationship. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong for distancing herself, and based on the information, the answer is B.\n"
