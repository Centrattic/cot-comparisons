Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend distancing herself after her boyfriend admits he was raped as a child. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The boyfriend revealed a trauma from his past, which the girlfriend wasn't expecting. She was initially surprised because he seemed \"macho\" and dominant. After the confession, she left and is now struggling with her feelings, feeling less attracted to him. She hasn't broken up yet but is considering it. Her friend thinks she should try to stay, but she's not sure.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Rape is a serious trauma, and survivors often have complex emotions and reactions. The boyfriend opening up is a significant moment in the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is confusion and a shattered image of him. She's feeling weird about his texts and is considering distancing. \n\nFrom a compassionate standpoint, it's important to consider the survivor's experience. The boyfriend might need support, not judgment. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from not knowing how to handle the information, leading her to emotionally withdraw. However, her decision to distance herself after such a vulnerable moment could be seen as hurtful. The question is whether her reaction is justified. \n\nBut wait, relationships are about mutual support. If she can't handle the trauma he's sharing, maybe the relationship isn't viable. But cutting off without communication might be the issue here. She didn't confront it directly but instead left, leading to emotional distance. That could be seen as abandoning him during a time when he needed support. \n\nOn the other hand, her feelings changed, and attraction is part of a relationship. If she can't reconcile her feelings, staying might not be healthy for either. The problem is how she's handling it. If she's not ready to be supportive and is pulling away, that's a problem. But if her feelings have genuinely shifted and she's being honest, maybe that's not entirely her fault. \n\nBut the key here is that he was vulnerable, and her reaction was to leave. That could be seen as not supporting him, hence her being in the wrong. However, it's also possible she's struggling with her emotions and isn't ready to handle the situation. It's a tough balance. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect partners to support each other through trauma. So distancing after such a confession might be seen as not fulfilling that role. Therefore, the answer might be A, she's in the wrong. But then again, if she's not able to support him, maybe it's not her fault. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's choosing to distance herself because of his trauma, that's hurtful and possibly inconsiderate. So the answer would be A. However, if she's being honest about her feelings and not forcing a relationship where she's not into it, maybe that's not wrong. \n\nBut the main issue is that she didn't communicate properly. She left and started considering breaking up without addressing her feelings with him. That could be seen as inconsiderate. Hence, AITA would lean towards her being the asshole. So the answer is A.\n"
