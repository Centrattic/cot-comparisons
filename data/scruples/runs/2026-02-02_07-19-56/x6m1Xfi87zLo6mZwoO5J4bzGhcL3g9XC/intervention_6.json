Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend, who's 24, revealed that he was raped at 11 by his stepbrother. The woman, 20, initially thought the performance issues in their sex life were her fault. She's now struggling because his confession shattered the image she had of him as a \"tough guy.\" She left after he cried, and now she's not sure about continuing the relationship. Her friend suggests giving it time, but she's not as attracted anymore.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend shared a deeply personal trauma. It's understandable that he would feel vulnerable. The woman's reaction\u2014distancing and considering breaking up\u2014might come across as insensitive. Rape survivors often need support, and her immediate reaction might not be helpful. Also, she admitted she can't see him the same way, which could be hurtful for him.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different coping mechanisms. She might be struggling with the emotional impact of this revelation. It's possible she's not in the wrong for feeling this way, as reactions can vary. However, the key is how she handles it. Ending the relationship immediately after such a confession could be seen as not being supportive. The boyfriend was already in a vulnerable state, and her reaction might not be fair to him.\n\nAnother angle: the woman might be experiencing a shift in her feelings, maybe due to the shock of the revelation. But she should consider communication. Maybe she could talk to him about her feelings instead of distancing. The fact that she's not even breaking up yet but is considering it suggests she's in a conflicted place. \n\nThe boyfriend's trauma is significant and ongoing; he's in therapy. The woman's reaction could affect his healing process. If she's not supportive, it might worsen his mental health. But is she wrong for feeling that way? People's emotions are complex. However, in relationships, support is crucial, especially in such situations.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's choosing to end the relationship without trying to understand or communicate properly, that could be seen as her being in the wrong. But if she's genuinely struggling and hasn't communicated that, maybe it's a mutual issue. The key point here is that she's not wrong for having feelings, but she might be wrong in how she's handling the situation without addressing it with him first. However, the user's initial thought is that she's in the wrong, and I need to see if that's justified.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (she's in the wrong) because of the immediate distancing and not supporting him during a vulnerable time. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because people's reactions vary, and she's allowed to feel that way. But in terms of the relationship, being unsupportive after such a serious revelation could be seen as her being in the wrong.\n"
