Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend confided in her about being a sexual assault survivor, and she's distancing herself, considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend opened up about being raped as a child, which is a very sensitive and traumatic experience. The author is struggling with this new information and is feeling a loss of attraction, which is affecting their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's vulnerability and the author's reaction. When someone shares such personal trauma, it's a big moment of trust. The author's immediate reaction was to leave and not communicate well. She's now considering distancing, which might be seen as a betrayal of trust or not giving enough support.\n\nBut wait, people react differently to such news. The author might not have any malicious intent; she's just struggling to process this. However, she's the one who ended up leaving the situation, and now she's not responding to texts, which could be hurtful to the boyfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, it's also valid for her to feel a shift in how she sees him. The trauma disclosure has changed her perception, and she's not sure if she can be attracted to him anymore. That's a personal struggle, but how she handles it is important. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. If she distances without communication, that's not ideal. But if she's honest about her feelings and willing to work through them, maybe it's a different story. The problem is she's considering breaking up without addressing it openly. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend might be in a vulnerable state. If she's not supporting him now, that could be seen as the wrong choice. But if she's not emotionally able to handle it, is that her fault? It's a tough line between self-respect and supporting a partner.\n\nI think the key is whether she's being cruel or not. If she's honest and gives him a chance to process, maybe it's not her fault. But if she's ghosting or being dismissive, that's worse. The AITA usually looks at intent and harm. Here, the harm is on both sides, but she's the one who's not communicating. \n\nSo, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because people have different reactions, but she should probably communicate better. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, so if she's not being malicious, maybe the answer is B. But some might say she should have given more support, hence A. Hmm.\n"
