Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the woman in the situation is in the wrong after distancing herself from her boyfriend who revealed he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend came forward with a traumatic experience, which is a big deal. Rape is a serious crime, and the fact that he's sharing this after a week of performance issues shows he's vulnerable. The woman's reaction is mixed. She was supportive at the moment but then felt weird, leading her to consider breaking up. \n\nThe key points here are her emotional response and the reasons behind her actions. She mentions her image of him being shattered, which suggests she had a certain perception of him as a \"tough guy\" before. This could imply internalized biases or stereotypes about masculinity and sexual assault survivors, which is a problem. However, it's also normal to have a shift in feelings when someone's personal history changes your perception.\n\nAre her feelings valid? People can struggle with how to process a partner's trauma, and it's okay to feel confused or less attracted if the relationship dynamics change. But is she in the wrong? If she's distancing herself because of his trauma, that could be harmful and invalidating. On the other hand, if she's being honest about her inability to move forward despite support, maybe it's more about mutual compatibility.\n\nThe question is whether her reaction is justified. The boyfriend is dealing with trauma, which can affect relationships. But the woman's response is to consider ending things. It's a tough call. She might not be in the wrong if she's being truthful about her feelings, but she might be wrong if she's prioritizing her discomfort over his well-being and the relationship's potential. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's considering it but hasn't broken up yet might show she's trying to work through it. The best friend's advice to give it more time is there. So maybe she's not in the wrong, but she needs to communicate her feelings and see if both can work through it. \n\nIn the end, the answer depends on whether her decision is based on valid reasons (like inability to support him) or on stereotypes (like expecting a \"tough guy\" not to have trauma). The latter would make her wrong, while the former might be a personal choice but still a difficult one.\n"
