Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend is a 24-year-old who's been in a five-month relationship with a 20-year-old. He's described as dominant and macho, which might have contributed to the author's initial perception of him. The rape was committed by his stepbrother when he was 11, something he only recently confided in her. The author felt her image of him shattered and now feels weird about the relationship, considering ending it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate if that's the case. The key points here are understanding the emotional impact of the revelation and the appropriate response. Rape is a traumatic experience, and the boyfriend's vulnerability in sharing it is significant. The author's reaction is to distance herself and feel less attraction, which could be seen as invalidating his experience.\n\nBut wait, people react differently. Maybe she's struggling with the new information, especially if she had a certain image of him. However, ending a relationship over this could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, it's also valid for her to feel uncomfortable and reassess the relationship. The question is whether her reaction is justified or if she's wrong for not being supportive enough.\n\nThe boyfriend was crying and vulnerable, and she left. Leaving right after he broke down might not be the best response. Support is crucial in such situations. However, the author might be processing the information and needs time. The therapist's involvement suggests he's working through it, and the author might not know how to handle it. But if her reaction is to distance and not engage, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, considering the duration of the relationship (5 months), it's possible she's not fully committed yet. But the timing of the revelation (after a week of performance issues) might be relevant. He waited until a stressful time to share this, which could have been a trigger for her. However, his choice to share it is valid, and her reaction could be seen as dismissive.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, supporting a partner through trauma is important. But it's also okay for someone to feel overwhelmed and need space. The question is whether her distancing is a natural reaction or a failure to support. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal values. However, in most cases, invalidating a partner's trauma is frowned upon. So, the author might be in the wrong if she's not making an effort to understand and support him.\n\nBut the user's friend suggests she should try to keep dating him, which implies that the friend sees potential for reconciliation and support. The author's lack of attraction now could be due to the trauma's impact on her perception. However, attraction can be affected by various factors, including emotional distress. Still, walking away without trying to work through the issues might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, her response might be seen as invalidating his trauma. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because she didn't provide the necessary support and chose to distance herself instead.\n"
