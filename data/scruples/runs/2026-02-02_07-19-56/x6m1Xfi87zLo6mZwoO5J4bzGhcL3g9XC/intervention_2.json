Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that her boyfriend told her he was raped as a child, and she's distancing herself from him. She's wondering if she's the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He was raped when he was 11 by his stepbrother, which is a traumatic experience. He was crying and breaking down when he told her, and she left. Now she's feeling weird every time he texts her. \n\nHer friend thinks she should try to keep dating him, but she's not as attracted to him anymore. They're not officially broken up yet, but she's considering it. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, when someone shares such a personal and traumatic experience, especially in a vulnerable state, the natural reaction would be support and understanding. The fact that she left the situation when he was upset might be seen as insensitive. She might be struggling with her feelings about her previous image of him versus the reality of his past. \n\nBut it's also important to consider her feelings. She's not the one who caused the trauma, and it's her right to feel conflicted. However, the key point is her reaction. Leaving him when he was emotionally vulnerable could be seen as not being there for him when he needed her most, which might hurt him. \n\nOn the other hand, she's honest about her feelings now. She's not pretending to be okay with it. Maybe she's going through a process of adjustment. But the question is whether she's at fault for distancing herself. \n\nI think the main issue here is that she didn't support him during a time when he needed her. People have the right to feel uncomfortable or even less attracted after such a revelation, but how she handled it matters. Leaving immediately and not being there for him could be seen as inconsiderate. However, she's also being honest about her feelings. \n\nBut given that he was in a vulnerable state and she left, that's probably not the right action. So the answer might be that she is in the wrong (A) because she didn't support him at that moment. But maybe she's not entirely in the wrong because people can have mixed emotions. Hmm.\n\nI think the consensus in many AITA situations like this is that supporting someone when they're vulnerable is crucial. So even if the feelings change later, not being present during that moment is a problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
