Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend told her he was raped when he was 11 by his stepbrother. The author is a 20-year-old woman, and they've been dating for five months. She mentions that he was acting dominant before, like a \"tough guy,\" and now this revelation has shattered her image of him. She's distancing herself, not sure if she can see him the same way, and considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is dealing with trauma from a past rape. That's a serious and sensitive issue. Survivors of sexual assault often have complex emotional responses and might need support. The fact that he confided in her shows he trusts her, and it's a big step for him. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with her own feelings. She mentions that the revelation has changed her perception of him, affecting her attraction and making her feel weird when she sees his texts. She's not sure if she can continue the relationship. Now, is it wrong for her to feel this way? Well, people have different reactions to trauma disclosures. Some might feel overwhelmed, others might want to support more. \n\nBut the key here is whether her reaction is justified. She's been dating him for five months, which is a relatively short time. She didn't know about this part of his history. The problem is that she's using this as a reason to distance herself, which could be seen as invalidating his experience. However, she's also human and might not be equipped to handle this trauma in a partner, especially so suddenly. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. If she's being judgmental or dismissive, then maybe she is. But if she's struggling with her feelings and needs time to process, perhaps she's not entirely at fault. The issue is that she's using this as a reason to end the relationship without really engaging with him about it. Her best friend thinks she should try to keep dating him, but she's not feeling attracted anymore. \n\nIt's important to note that being a rape survivor doesn't make someone less of a person. The author might be struggling with internalized stigma or stereotypes about masculinity, given that the boyfriend was seen as \"macho\" before. Maybe she's conflicted because his trauma doesn't fit the image she had of him. \n\nHowever, the fact that she's considering ending the relationship because of this, without even discussing it openly with him, could be problematic. It might be more responsible to approach the situation with empathy, seek couples counseling, or give him the support he needs. By distancing herself, she's not showing support, which could be hurtful. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a nuanced situation. If she's being dismissive of his trauma and using it as a reason to end the relationship without effort, then yes. But if she's genuinely struggling and needs time to process, maybe not. However, the way she's presenting it\u2014distance immediately after the disclosure and considering breaking up\u2014without trying to work through it might indicate that she's not fully considering his needs. \n\nThe answer might be that she's not entirely in the wrong because people do have different reactions to trauma, but she could have handled it better. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since she's using this as a reason to end the relationship without engaging further, it's possible that she is. But there's no clear right or wrong here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she's not comfortable. But the problem is that she's making the decision based on her changed perception rather than supporting him through his trauma. \n\nI think the answer here is that she is not in the wrong because people can have different reactions, and it's her right to decide if the relationship is right for her. But she might not have handled it with the support he needed. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is B (No).\n"
