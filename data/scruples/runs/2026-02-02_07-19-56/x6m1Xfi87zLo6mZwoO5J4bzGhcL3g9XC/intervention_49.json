Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend told her he was raped as a child, and she's now distancing herself, considering breaking up. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which is a big deal. Rape is a serious crime and dealing with its aftermath can be really difficult. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014she's confused because her image of him as a \"tough guy\" clashed with the reality of his trauma. She might feel uncomfortable or even have some internalized stigma or misconceptions about male victims of rape, which could affect her attraction or perception of him.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she's not obligated to continue the relationship just because he shared this. People have different reactions to trauma disclosures. Some might feel closer, others might need time to process. The key here is whether she's being cruel or dismissive. She said she left after he broke down, which might be a normal reaction to a shocking revelation. She's not ignoring him but is considering ending the relationship. Her best friend thinks she should give it time, but she's not feeling the same connection.\n\nHowever, the way she's distancing herself might be hurtful. He was vulnerable, and her reaction could be seen as rejecting him. But she's also allowed to have feelings and attractions that change. It's not necessarily wrong to end a relationship if you can't reconcile the changes in how you see the person. The problem is whether her reaction is unfounded or if she's blaming him somehow. The story doesn't suggest she's blaming him, just that she's struggling with the shift in her perception.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The answer is probably not. People have different responses to trauma. Some might handle it better, but it's not wrong to step back if you can't get past the emotional impact. However, she could be doing more to communicate her feelings to him, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it better. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
