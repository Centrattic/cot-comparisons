Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who's dating a man who told her he was raped as a child. After finding out, she's distancing herself, feeling weird, and considering breaking up. Her friend thinks she should try to stay together, but she's not as attracted anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the boyfriend's trauma disclosure and the woman's reaction. When someone shares such a personal and traumatic experience, it's a vulnerable moment. The woman initially supported him by holding him and listening, but then left and started pulling away. \n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong depends on how we view reactions to trauma and relationships. People have different coping mechanisms. Some might feel shocked or find it hard to adjust their perception of their partner. But is that her fault? I think it's natural to have a shift in perception, but the responsibility here isn't just on her. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication is key. If she's struggling with her feelings, it's important to talk about it. However, her distancing might be hurtful to him, especially since he opened up. But is that her being in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. She's processing her emotions, which is a personal struggle. \n\nThe question is whether her reaction is wrong. Being in a relationship with someone who has a history of trauma can be challenging, and it's okay to feel conflicted. However, the wrong here might be more on her not addressing her feelings openly rather than the distancing itself. But I don't think she's necessarily in the wrong because people react differently. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. It's a complex emotional situation, and her feelings are valid even if they're difficult to navigate. The important thing is how they both approach their relationship moving forward with honesty and support.\n"
