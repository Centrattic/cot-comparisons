Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend, who is 24, has been having trouble performing sexually. He confesses that he was raped by his stepbrother when he was 11. The author (20 years old) felt her image of him as a \"macho\" and dominant guy was shattered, leading her to feel uncomfortable and less attracted. She left after the conversation and is considering breaking up, even though they're not officially split yet.\n\nThe author's best friend suggests she give it some time, but she's struggling with attraction. The question is whether she's in the wrong here. \n\nI should consider several angles. First, the boyfriend's experience: being raped as a child is a severe trauma that can have long-term psychological effects. The fact that he shared this with her indicates trust. His performance issues might be linked to this trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is experiencing emotional conflict. She had an image of him as a strong, tough guy, which contrasts with the trauma he's disclosing. Her reaction might be a natural response to such a revelation. However, distancing herself immediately after he opens up about such a sensitive topic could be seen as invalidating his experience. \n\nIt's important to note that the author didn't act out of malice; she's struggling with her feelings. But she hasn't communicated her feelings clearly to him, which could be a problem. Ending the relationship or distancing might be his way of coping, but it's not his fault to expect her to handle the emotions perfectly. However, the responsibility here might be on the author to work through her feelings rather than immediately distancing, especially since he was vulnerable.\n\nAnother point: the author is in a new relationship (5 months), and such revelations can be challenging. It's possible that her reaction is a result of not being fully prepared for such a deep emotional issue. But she's also honest about her feelings. \n\nIn terms of \"wrongdoing,\" the author isn't doing something malicious. However, in terms of responsibility, relationships require work. If she can't reconcile her feelings, it might be a mutual decision. But immediately distancing might not give the relationship a fair chance. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She's not evil or at fault for having a difficult reaction. But if the issue is her inability to accept his past, maybe there's a responsibility to communicate and work through it. However, given the complexity of human emotions, it's not entirely her fault. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If \"wrong\" means she's being unjustified in her reaction, then maybe not. People have different boundaries. However, if \"wrong\" is about not giving enough support, then perhaps. The answer might hinge on whether it's her responsibility to stay despite her feelings or if she's allowed to follow her heart.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often emphasizes communication and effort. If she hasn't talked to him about her feelings, maybe she should. But since she's already considering breaking up, maybe she's not at fault for being honest about her feelings. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's dealing with a difficult situation and her reaction is genuine.\n"
