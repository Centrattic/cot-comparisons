Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong after distancing from their boyfriend who revealed he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The BF is 24, they've been dating 5 months. He's been having performance issues in bed. He breaks down and tells her he was raped by his stepbrother at 11. She feels her image of him as a \"tough guy\" is shattered. She left his apartment after he cried, and now she's not as attracted to him. Her friend thinks she should stay, but she's considering breaking up.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong for distancing herself. The options are A or B. \n\nI should consider the context. He shared a traumatic experience. Survivors of trauma often have complex reactions. The fact that he was raped as a child is a significant part of his history. The user is struggling with her attraction and image of him. But is she wrong for feeling that way?\n\nIt's important to note that everyone has different boundaries and reactions. However, dismissing someone because they've shared a trauma might be seen as invalidating. But she's not the one who committed a wrongdoing here. She's reacting to new information that's affecting her feelings. \n\nAlso, she hasn't ended the relationship yet. She's considering it, but hasn't acted. So, is she in the wrong? Maybe not. People have the right to their feelings. However, the way she reacted (leaving immediately and not trying to process it together) could be seen as inconsiderate. But the problem is her emotional response, not an action done wrongfully. \n\nThe key here is whether her reaction is unjustified. Since she's struggling to accept this part of him, it's a personal issue. The boyfriend's trauma is his own experience; she's allowed to feel differently, but maybe she should work on accepting him. But the question is if she's in the wrong. If she's not doing anything harmful, just having feelings, then maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if she's cutting him off without support, that could be seen as wrong. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because she's dealing with her own emotions and hasn't acted unkindly beyond distancing, which is a personal choice.\n"
