Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend revealing he was raped as a child, and the author distancing herself afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend has a traumatic past, which is incredibly serious. Rape is a violent crime, and the fact that he was a child when it happened adds another layer of trauma. Sharing such a vulnerable secret is a big step and shows trust. However, the author is struggling with a shift in how she perceives him. She mentions she had an image of him as a \"macho\" or \"tough guy,\" which was shattered after the confession. Now she's not as attracted to him and feels weird seeing his texts. She hasn't broken up yet but is considering it.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, it's natural to have mixed emotions when someone close reveals a traumatic experience. The author's reaction might be a result of not knowing how to process this new information. Her attraction issues might stem from a mental block or discomfort, which isn't uncommon in such situations. On the other hand, the boyfriend was vulnerable, and her distancing could be seen as a breach of trust or emotional support.\n\nBut let's think about consent and personal boundaries. The author has the right to feel how she does. Trauma can affect relationships, but it's important to differentiate between a reaction to trauma and being at fault. The boyfriend's history doesn't make him less of a person, but the author's feelings are valid. However, walking away immediately without effort to understand or support might be seen as harsh. Yet, the story doesn't say she's cruel or dismissive; she was there for him initially, then left. It's a complex situation where both people are dealing with their emotions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual understanding. If the author can't support her partner through his healing, that's a problem. But if she's struggling, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The key is whether she's being fair and compassionate. The answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction is a temporary adjustment or a permanent decision. If she's giving him space to get help and she's working on her feelings, maybe it's okay. If she's walking away without effort, that's different. The story says she's considering breaking up but hasn't yet. Her best friend suggests staying for a bit, so maybe she's still in a processing phase.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong). People react differently to trauma disclosures. It's not her fault she's struggling, but she should consider the implications of her actions on their relationship. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's trauma is real and the author's feelings are valid, she's not necessarily wrong. It's a complicated situation where both could have valid perspectives. The \"wrong\" might not be clear-cut, but the answer seems to lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
