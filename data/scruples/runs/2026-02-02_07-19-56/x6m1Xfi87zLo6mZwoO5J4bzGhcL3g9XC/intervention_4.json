Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend told her he was raped as a child, and she distanced herself. She's now questioning if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend is a 24-year-old with a tough childhood, which he's just starting to address with a therapist. He was a \"tough guy\" image before, so this revelation might have been a shock. He breaks down emotionally when he shares this, and she leaves the apartment. Now she feels weird seeing him, her attraction has diminished, and she's considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here: he shared a traumatic experience, she felt her image of him shattered, and she's distancing herself. The question is whether she's in the wrong for that.\n\nI know that in relationships, when someone shares a deeply personal and traumatic experience, the partner's reaction is crucial. If he's vulnerable, the expected response might be empathy and support. However, it's also important to consider that people have different coping mechanisms and emotional reactions. \n\nShe might be struggling with her feelings because his disclosure changed her perception of him. That's a common reaction, but it's not necessarily her fault. However, is it wrong to distance herself after he was vulnerable? If she's not able to support him or if her reaction is causing harm, maybe she is in the wrong. But if her feelings are genuine and she's not intentionally being cruel, perhaps not.\n\nBut wait, he was the one who shared something traumatic, expecting support. Her immediate reaction was to leave, which could be seen as dismissive. However, she did hold him and let him vent initially. The problem is her subsequent distancing and lack of attraction. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. She's not at fault for having feelings, but maybe she's not handling it the best way. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether she's handling it well. \n\nIf the boyfriend's trauma is affecting their relationship, it's a tough spot. She might need time to process, but walking away could hurt him. However, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if her feelings change. So maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because people have different reactions to trauma and it's okay for her feelings to change. But I need to be careful here. Some might argue that she should stay and support him, but that's not fair if she can't be there for him. So B.\n"
