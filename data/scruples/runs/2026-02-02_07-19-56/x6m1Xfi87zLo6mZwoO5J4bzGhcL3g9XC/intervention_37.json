Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her he was raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend, who's 24, revealed to his 20-year-old girlfriend that he was raped by his stepbrother when he was 11. This is a significant trauma. The author mentions that he's usually seen as a \"tough guy\" with a muscular build and dominant personality, which makes the revelation even more unexpected for her. After he breaks down and tells her, she leaves and now feels weird about texting him, considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Her best friend suggests she should try to keep dating him, but she's lost attraction. So, the key points here are: the boyfriend shared a very personal and traumatic experience, the author's reaction is to distance herself, and she's considering breaking up.\n\nRape survivors often face stigma and judgment, even though it's not their fault. The boyfriend's vulnerability in sharing this might have been a big step for him. The author's reaction could be influenced by her own biases or expectations about masculinity. If she can't support him through this, that might be a problem. But she's also allowed to have feelings about how this changes her perception of him.\n\nHowever, relationships require mutual support. If she's not able to handle this and continues to distance herself, it might be unfair to him. But she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she feels it's not working. The key is whether her decision is based on valid reasons or harmful stereotypes. If she's distancing because of his trauma, that's problematic. If it's because she can't cope with the change in her perception, that's more about her own limitations.\n\nThe answer might depend on cultural context and personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong if she realizes the relationship isn't working for her, but if her reaction is due to stigma against male survivors, that would make her at fault. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks for malicious intent. Here, the author is conflicted and unsure, not malicious. So maybe she's not in the wrong, but she should reflect on her reasons. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's honest about her feelings and not intentionally hurting him, but she should consider his needs too.\n"
