Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend revealing he was raped as a child, and she's distancing herself from him, considering breaking up. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience, which he's dealing with through therapy. The woman was initially attracted to his \"macho\" image, which is now shattered. She left during a vulnerable moment and feels weird about texting him. Her friend suggests staying, but she's lost attraction. The key here is whether her reaction is justified.\n\nRape is a serious trauma, and disclosure can be very difficult. The boyfriend was crying and in distress when he told her. The woman's immediate reaction was to leave, which might come off as insensitive. However, it's also important to consider her emotional response. She might be struggling with the new information affecting her perception of him. But in such situations, the survivor's emotional needs are paramount. The woman's reaction could be seen as dismissive, especially since she hasn't made efforts to support him post-disclosure. She's choosing to distance herself, which might not be supportive. However, it's also possible she's dealing with her own feelings and isn't ready to process this. But in relationships, when a partner opens up about trauma, the other's response is crucial. Walking out during a breakdown could be seen as not being there for him when he needs support. So, even if she's having internal conflict, her actions could be considered inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards her being in the wrong because she didn't support him during a vulnerable time. But sometimes people have different reactions, so it's not black and white. Still, in the context of the question, the dominant view would likely be that she's in the wrong for not being supportive.\n"
