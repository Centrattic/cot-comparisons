Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was a rape victim. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend opened up about being raped as a child, which was unexpected to the author. She felt the image she had of him as a \"tough guy\" shattered, leading to her distancing herself. She's not sure if she can be attracted to him anymore and is considering breaking up.\n\nNow, evaluating if she's in the wrong. The key points here are emotional support and empathy. When someone discloses a traumatic experience like childhood rape, it's a vulnerable moment. The author's immediate reaction was to leave the apartment and then feel weird about texts. Her friend thinks she should keep dating him, but she's struggling with attraction and how she sees him now.\n\nIs the author's reaction justified? Well, people react differently under stress. However, the boyfriend was in a fragile state, and her response might not have been supportive. Distancing right after such a confession could be seen as insensitive, even if she's struggling with her feelings. She did hold him and let him vent, but leaving and not being able to continue the relationship might be seen as not providing the support he needed during a tough time.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also valid for her to feel a shift in her perception and attraction. Everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels. If she can't reconcile her feelings, maybe it's not fair to her to stay in the relationship. However, the key here is the timing and how she handled it. The question is whether she's in the wrong for distancing herself. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. Emotionally, she's dealing with new information that changes her perception. But from the boyfriend's perspective, he needed support, and her reaction might have been hurtful. So, while she's not necessarily \"wrong\" in feeling the way she does, her actions might be seen as not supportive. However, the answer choice is between A and B. If the question is whether she's in the wrong for her reaction, the answer is A (yes) because she didn't provide support during his vulnerable moment. Alternatively, if it's about whether she's wrong to be considering breaking up, that's more complex. But the question is about distancing after he admitted being raped, so the immediate reaction of leaving and feeling weird might be seen as inconsiderate. Hence, A.\n"
