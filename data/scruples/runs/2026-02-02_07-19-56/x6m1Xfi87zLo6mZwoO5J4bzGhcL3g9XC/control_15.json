Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the boyfriend revealed he was raped as a child, and the author is now distancing herself, feeling weird about the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional and psychological aspects here. The boyfriend has a traumatic past, which can affect his mental health and relationships. The author is struggling with how to handle this revelation. She used to see him as a \"tough guy\" but now that image is shattered. She's not sure if she can be attracted to him the same way anymore.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and understanding. The boyfriend is seeking support from his therapist and confiding in his partner. Reactions can vary, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIt's important to note that everyone has the right to feel comfortable in their relationship. If this revelation affects the author's feelings and attraction, it's a personal reaction. However, it's also a matter of how she handles the situation. She hasn't broken up with him yet, but is considering it. The friend suggests staying, but the author is conflicted.\n\nThe main issue is whether her reaction is justified. It's not right or wrong per se, but more about personal feelings and boundaries. The author isn't being cruel; she's just struggling with the change in perception. So, the answer is likely B (No), she isn't in the wrong, because people's reactions to such revelations can be complex and personal. However, it's also important to approach the situation with compassion and communication. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. So the answer is B.\n"
