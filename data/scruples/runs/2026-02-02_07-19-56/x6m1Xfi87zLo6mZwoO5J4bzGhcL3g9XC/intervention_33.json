Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend (24 years old, 5 months dating) starts having performance issues in the bedroom. The author initially thought it was her fault but then he breaks down and tells her he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother. He's also seeing a therapist now. The author feels her image of him is shattered because he seemed so \"macho\" before, and now she's not as attracted to him. She left after he cried, and now she's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is a 20-year-old in a 5-month relationship. The boyfriend's trauma is significant\u2014rape at a young age. Trauma can affect someone's mental health and sexuality, so his performance issues might be related to that. She's not blaming him for the trauma itself, but she's struggling with her feelings after learning about it. She's considering ending the relationship because her attraction has diminished, which is a personal reaction.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, is it fair to judge someone for their emotional response? The author isn't denying his trauma or shaming him for it. She's honest about her feelings. The problem is that she's distancing herself after he's vulnerable. But people have different coping mechanisms. She might be reacting to the cognitive dissonance between her previous perception of him as a \"tough guy\" and his trauma. However, that's her issue to work through. The question is whether she is in the wrong for deciding not to continue the relationship after this disclosure.\n\nRelationships require mutual support and understanding. If she can't overcome her changed feelings, maybe it's not fair for either of them to stay together. But is it wrong to change your feelings? People can't be held responsible for their emotions. So she's not necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. However, maybe she's not being supportive enough given his vulnerability. The key is whether she's being cruel or just honestly acknowledging her feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that she left immediately after he confessed might be a factor. He was in a fragile state, and leaving could have been hurtful. But she might have done that to process her own emotions. It's a tough balance between supporting a partner in crisis and taking time for oneself. \n\nIn terms of the question: Is the author in the wrong? The answer would depend on whether her reaction is considered valid. Since she's not denying his trauma and is being honest about her feelings, it's more about her personal boundaries. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because people can't be forced to maintain relationships they no longer feel comfortable in, even if the reason is their own emotional response. But some might argue she should stay and support him, but that's more about what she should do, not whether she's wrong in the sense of moral failure.\n"
