Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who's dating a man for 5 months. He reveals he was raped as a child, and she's distancing herself, feeling weird about him. She's considering breaking up but isn't sure if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The man disclosed a traumatic experience. The woman is struggling with her feelings, maybe because her initial image of him as \"macho\" is shattered. She's not in the relationship anymore but hasn't broken up yet. Her friend suggests she try to stay together, but she's not attractive to him anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are about empathy, understanding, and the dynamics of the relationship. When someone shares such a personal trauma, it's a vulnerable moment. The woman's reaction is to distance herself, which could be seen as a lack of support. However, her feelings are genuine\u2014she's struggling with her attraction and comfort level after the disclosure.\n\nBut wait, is it the woman's fault if she can't reconcile her feelings? People have different reactions to trauma. However, the issue here is that she left during his emotional breakdown and is now considering ending the relationship. She might need to reflect on whether her reaction is due to his trauma or other factors. But if she's honest about her feelings and respects his trauma while making her decision, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if she's dismissing his pain and not trying to understand, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the context: the man's behavior (being dominant, macho image) might have clashed with his trauma, leading to her confusion. But she's dealing with her own emotions here. The question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after this revelation. It's a complex situation where both parties have to communicate. If she's honest about her feelings without blaming him, she's not in the wrong. But if she's being insensitive, she would be. The text says she let him vent but left, then feels weird about texts. Maybe she needs to talk it out more with him, but her feelings are valid. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's about mutual compatibility and personal feelings.\n"
