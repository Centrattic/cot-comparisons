Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend disclosed he was raped as a child, and the author is distancing herself. The main question is whether she's at fault for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend told her about being raped when he was 11 by his stepbrother. He had been having performance issues in the bedroom, which he linked to this trauma. The author felt her image of him as a \"tough guy\" shattered, leading to her feeling weird around him. She left after he cried, and now she's considering breaking up despite her friend's advice to stay.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the impact of trauma disclosure on a relationship. The boyfriend is dealing with a significant trauma from his past, which is affecting their current relationship. The author is struggling with how to process this information and is experiencing a shift in her feelings towards him. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From what I know, being a victim of rape is a serious and traumatic experience, and it can affect someone in various ways, especially in intimate relationships. The boyfriend's trauma might be causing his current issues, like performance anxiety. The author is reacting to this by distancing herself, which is a natural emotional response. However, relationships require communication and mutual support.\n\nBut here, the author isn't completely cutting off; she hasn't broken up yet but is considering it. She's also trying to process her feelings. It's important to consider that her reaction isn't about blaming the victim but about her own emotional response. The boyfriend's disclosure is a vulnerable act, and her reaction could be seen as a lack of support. However, it's also valid for her to feel confused or unsettled by this new information, as it changes her perception of him.\n\nIn such cases, it's not necessarily about who is right or wrong, but about how both parties handle the situation. The author might not be in the wrong because her feelings are genuine, but she should also consider the emotional impact on her partner. However, the question is framing it as a yes/no for AITA (Am I the Asshole), so the answer might be based on whether her reaction is justified.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is distancing herself not because of any fault of the boyfriend's but because of her own inability to adjust to this new information. Since the boyfriend was the one who disclosed his trauma, it's a sensitive issue. The author's reaction could be seen as a lack of empathy or support, but it's also a personal struggle.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B) because her feelings are valid, but she should communicate openly. However, if the answer expects that she should be more understanding, maybe A. But since the question is from the author's perspective and she's not dismissing his trauma but dealing with her own feelings, it's more likely B.\n"
