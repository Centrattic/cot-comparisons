Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after distancing herself from her boyfriend who revealed he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend disclosed a traumatic experience from his past. The author felt her image of him changed, and she's now struggling with attraction. She left during the conversation, hasn't broken up yet, but is considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, people react differently to trauma disclosures. The author's feelings are valid; her attraction is affected, which is a personal reaction. But is that a good reason to distance? Maybe not. She might need to process her feelings without immediately ending the relationship. However, she hasn't confirmed the truth of his story or considered the emotional toll it took on him. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend was vulnerable when sharing, and her reaction might be hurtful. But she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if her feelings change. The key here is whether she's dismissive of his trauma. The friend suggests giving it time, but the author is struggling. \n\nUltimately, while her feelings are her own, how she handles them might be where she could be in the wrong. She should communicate openly instead of distancing. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but could handle it better. But since the question is whether she is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
