Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for distancing herself from her boyfriend after he revealed he was raped as a child. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend, who is described as dominant and \"macho,\" confides in the author about being raped at 11 by his stepbrother. After he breaks down emotionally, the author leaves and feels weird about texting him again. Her friend suggests staying, but she's losing attraction and considering a breakup. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her reaction and the context. When someone shares a traumatic experience like being raped, especially after breaking down emotionally, the typical social expectation is for support and compassion. However, the author is distancing herself, which could be hurtful. But maybe she's struggling with her feelings and the sudden revelation.\n\nI should consider if her reaction is normal. It's possible she's not in the wrong if she's feeling overwhelmed. People have different coping mechanisms. However, ending the relationship so quickly might be seen as dismissive, especially since he's seeking therapy. But if the attraction is gone and she's not comfortable, that's her right.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's disclosure is a significant vulnerability. Her immediate reaction could be seen as unkind, even if she's conflicted. The \"AITA\" question is about whether her actions (distancing, considering breakup) are justified. In AITA contexts, the community often looks at intent and support. If she's not giving him the support he needs during a vulnerable time, that's considered being in the wrong.\n\nBut she does say she held him and let him vent, which is supportive. Then she left and later feels weird. The problem is the distancing after a traumatic disclosure. People might argue that she should work through her feelings instead of cutting him off, especially if it's early in the relationship. However, it's also her right to feel that the relationship isn't working for her anymore.\n\nI think the community might split, but the answer here is likely A (she's in the wrong) because the boyfriend shared something deeply personal, and her immediate reaction is to distance herself, which can be hurtful. Even if she's not attracted anymore, the way she's handling the situation is seen as unsupportive. The AITA community often emphasizes empathy and giving others the benefit of the doubt, so she might be considered the asshole here.\n"
