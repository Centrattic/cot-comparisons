Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person described in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend reveals he was raped as a child, and the author distances herself after that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements. The boyfriend shared a traumatic experience, which is a significant and personal disclosure. The author's reaction is to leave the apartment and feel less attracted to him. She's considering breaking up, even though they're not officially separated yet.\n\nThe main question is whether her reaction makes her the \"asshole in the situation\" (AITA). To determine this, I should think about empathy and how disclosures of trauma can affect relationships. When someone shares such a vulnerable part of their past, it's a moment that requires support and understanding. The author's immediate reaction is to distance herself, which might be seen as a lack of empathy or support. However, it's also important to note that people react differently to trauma, and the author might be struggling with her feelings now that her perception of her partner has changed.\n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the act of feeling uncomfortable or losing attraction isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to their feelings, even if they're not supportive initially. However, the way she handled it\u2014leaving during a moment of vulnerability\u2014might be seen as not being supportive. The boyfriend is in a fragile state, and her immediate departure could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she's struggling with it. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship might be a consequence of her feelings, but the initial distancing could be seen as a failure to provide the emotional support he needed at that moment. \n\nIn many cases, when someone discloses trauma, the listener is expected to respond with compassion. The author left him alone after he broke down, which might not be the best response. However, she might not have known how to respond and felt overwhelmed. The key is whether her actions were intentionally harmful. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B), because she's allowed to have changing feelings, but she might need to communicate better. However, others might argue she should have stayed and tried to support him. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what she should do next. Since her reaction, while not supportive, isn't necessarily malicious, the answer could be B. But I'm a bit conflicted. If she left him in that moment, that's a problem. However, the scenario says she left (they were at his apartment) but then later considers breaking up. The immediate reaction is to leave, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Still, she's not in the wrong for feeling the way she does, just perhaps for not handling it better. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but she needs to address her feelings and communication.\n"
