Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a woman in a 5-month relationship) is in the wrong after deciding to distance herself from her boyfriend upon learning he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is dominant, muscular, and seemed \"macho,\" so when he reveals he was raped by his stepbrother as an 11-year-old, the author feels her image of him is shattered. She's having trouble being attracted to him now, and she's considering ending the relationship. Her best friend says she should try to stay, but she's conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are about how people react to trauma and whether the author's reaction is justified. The boyfriend's trauma is significant, and it's affecting his current behavior (performance issues, crying). The author's response is emotional\u2014she's not attracted to him anymore and feels weird when he texts her. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend trusted her enough to share such a personal trauma. The author's reaction is based on her own feelings of attraction and discomfort, but she hasn't given up on the relationship entirely. She's considering it but hasn't broken up yet. \n\nOn one hand, it's her right to feel how she does. Trauma can change perceptions, and attraction can be affected. On the other hand, she's distancing herself without fully understanding or supporting him through this. The boyfriend might need more support rather than judgment. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer depends on perspective. If the author is being judgmental or not giving him a chance to heal, maybe she's at fault. However, if she's struggling with her feelings due to the trauma revelation, it's a personal issue. \n\nI think the key here is that her reaction is emotional and not malicious. She's trying to process the information and her feelings. She hasn't acted on ending the relationship yet. So she's not necessarily in the wrong, but maybe she should reflect more on her feelings and try to support him, if possible. \n\nThe answer is B (No), because it's not her fault for feeling this way. People have different reactions to trauma, and she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if her feelings change. However, it's important to approach this with empathy, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since she's not being cruel or judgmental beyond her own feelings, B makes sense.\n"
