Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by going through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old woman in a 5-month relationship with her boyfriend, who is 24. He works in a startup, is muscular, dominant, and they have a good sex life. But recently, he's been having trouble performing sexually. She asks him about it, and he breaks down, crying. He reveals he was raped as an 11-year-old by his stepbrother multiple times. After this confession, she holds him for a while but then leaves. She's now feeling weird about texting him and considering breaking up, even though they're not officially over yet. Her best friend suggests she should try to keep dating him, but she's not as attracted to him anymore. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend opened up about a traumatic experience. The author's reaction is mixed: she understands it's horrible, but her image of him as a \"macho\" or \"tough guy\" is shattered. She feels weird now and isn't as attracted to him. She left the apartment after he cried, and now she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to think about empathy and the impact of trauma. Rape survivors often experience a range of emotions and reactions, including intimacy issues. The boyfriend might be struggling with his trauma, which is affecting their relationship. The author is struggling with her feelings after learning about this trauma. It's a complex situation where both people have valid emotions.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she's no longer emotionally or physically comfortable. However, ending the relationship immediately after such a confession might be seen as insensitive if she didn't give him time to heal or if she didn't consider his feelings. On the other hand, she's honest about her feelings and is considering breaking up because she can't see him the same way. She's also not forcing the relationship if it's not working for her.\n\nThe key points here are consent, understanding, and mutual respect. The author is not at fault for feeling differently after learning about his past. However, she might be in the wrong if she's not giving him the chance to work through this together or if she's making a hasty decision without communication. The fact that she left the situation and is now contemplating breaking up is her prerogative, but it's important to consider how her actions affect him.\n\nIn many cases, people deal with trauma by opening up to someone they trust. If the author is no longer able to support him through this healing process, it's not necessarily her fault, but it's a choice that might have emotional consequences for both. The answer hinges on whether ending the relationship is justified based on her feelings or if she should have tried to work it out.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if it's not working for her. However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid perspectives. But according to the question's structure, which asks if she's in the wrong, and given that she's honest about her feelings and not forcing anything, the correct choice is B.\n"
