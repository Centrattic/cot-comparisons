Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after distancing themselves from their boyfriend after he admitted he was raped as a child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend revealed a traumatic experience from his past. That's a big deal. Rape is a serious issue, and sharing that kind of personal information is a significant moment in any relationship. The boyfriend might have felt safe enough to open up because he trusted the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with how to process this. They mention having a certain image of their boyfriend as \"macho\" and \"tough guy,\" which is now shattered. They're feeling weird when he texts them and are considering breaking up. Their best friend thinks they should give it a bit more time, but they're not feeling the same attraction anymore.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, people have different reactions to trauma in their partners. Some might feel more connected and supportive, while others might struggle with it. The author isn't rejecting the boyfriend for something he did wrong; it's about a traumatic event he experienced. However, it's also important to consider that the author might be reacting based on their own biases or preconceived notions about masculinity, which is problematic. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If they're being honest about their feelings and aren't malicious, maybe they're not entirely wrong. However, they should also consider if they can work through these feelings or if they're making a hasty decision. The boyfriend might need support, and the author's reaction could impact his healing. \n\nI think it's a complex situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but they might need to reflect on why they're reacting this way. The answer might depend on whether they're being fair and compassionate. If they're dismissing him without trying to understand, that's problematic. But if they're honestly struggling with the change in perception, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, in relationships, it's important to communicate and support each other through difficult times. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to support their partner. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is truthful about their loss of attraction and can't reconcile that, it's their right to end the relationship. So it's not a clear-cut yes or no. But since the question is a choice between A and B, I need to pick. The person isn't doing anything unethical, but maybe they're not in the wrong. Or perhaps they are because they're not being supportive enough. Hmm.\n"
