Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong after distancing herself from her boyfriend after he told her about being raped as a child. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend came forward with a traumatic experience. That takes courage, and it's a significant disclosure. The author mentions that her initial reaction was shock because he seemed \"macho\" and dominant. This suggests she might have had certain expectations about him, which were shattered by his vulnerability. \n\nShe left the situation and is now considering ending the relationship. Her friend suggests staying for a bit, but she's struggling with attraction and the new reality. Now, the user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction is understandable. Trauma can affect people differently, and it's possible she's processing this in her own way. She might not be ready to accept this part of him. But on the other hand, distancing herself after such a vulnerable moment could be hurtful. He shared something deeply personal, and her immediate reaction might make him feel rejected. \n\nIt's important to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They've only been dating five months, so the relationship might still be in an exploratory phase. Her reaction could be a result of not being prepared to handle such a significant part of his past. However, walking away without more effort to understand or communicate might be seen as self-centered. \n\nThe key here is whether she acknowledged his vulnerability and supported him, which she did initially, but then left. Her friend's advice is to stay for a while, but she's struggling. The question is about whether she's at fault. The answer might hinge on whether she's given him enough time and space to process her reaction or if she's made a hasty decision based on her own discomfort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. She's allowed to feel what she's feeling, but how she handles it matters. Walking away without addressing it properly could hurt him. However, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she's no longer comfortable. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong, but she might need to communicate better rather than just distancing.\n"
