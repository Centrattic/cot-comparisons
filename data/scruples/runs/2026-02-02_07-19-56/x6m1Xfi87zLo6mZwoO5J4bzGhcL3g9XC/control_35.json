Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend revealed he was raped as a child by his stepbrother, and now she's distancing herself, considering breaking up. She's confused because she used to find him attractive but now feels weird.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend's trauma is significant. Childhood sexual abuse can have long-lasting effects on a person's mental health and relationships. It's possible that his recent difficulties with performance could be related to this trauma resurfacing, especially if he's starting therapy. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable on some level. People often have preconceived images of their partners, and learning something traumatic can challenge those perceptions. However, her immediate response was to distance herself and consider breaking up. That's where the ethical dilemma comes in. \n\nIs it wrong to feel that way? Maybe not entirely. People have different thresholds for handling their partner's trauma. However, the key point is how she's handling it. She left during a vulnerable moment when he was breaking down. That might be seen as not supporting him when he needed her most. Her best friend suggests giving it more time, which is a common advice in such situations. \n\nBut attraction is a big factor here. If her feelings have genuinely changed because of his past, maybe that's a valid reason. However, it's important to consider if her reaction is based on genuine incompatibility or if it's a result of stigma or misunderstanding about trauma. Rape survivors often face judgment, and the author's reaction could be contributing to that. \n\nAlso, she hasn't ended it yet. She's in the process of considering it. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's being honest and not staying just for the sake of it, maybe she's not the asshole. But if she's being judgmental and not making an effort to support him, then she might be. The response should take into account the complexity of trauma and the importance of support in relationships. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because people have different reactions to trauma, and it's valid to reassess a relationship after such a revelation. However, it's also important to approach the situation with empathy. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and given that her feelings are genuine and she's not being malicious, the answer leans towards B.\n"
