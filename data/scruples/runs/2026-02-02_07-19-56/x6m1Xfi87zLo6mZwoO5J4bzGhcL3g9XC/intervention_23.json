Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that her boyfriend, who she had been dating for five months, told her he was raped when he was 11. She's now distancing herself from him and considering breaking up. Her best friend thinks she should stay with him, but she's not feeling the same attraction anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend opened up about a traumatic experience. That's a significant moment in a relationship where trust is built. The author's reaction is to leave the apartment and feel weird about texting him. She's struggling with her feelings after learning this information. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, people have different reactions to trauma disclosures. Some might feel overwhelmed or unsure how to handle it. It's possible that the shock of learning about his past is affecting her perception of him, which is natural. But is that justification for cutting him off? Or is it her right to reassess the relationship?\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend shared something deeply personal. The author's immediate reaction was to leave, which might have hurt him. If she had stayed and tried to support him, maybe things would be different. On the other hand, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she feels it's not right for her anymore. Trauma can affect someone's view of their partner, and if she can't see a way forward, maybe ending it is necessary for her well-being.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior: he's seeking therapy, which is a positive step. But the author might feel that his trauma is impacting their relationship in ways she's not prepared to handle. The key is whether her reaction is a natural response to the situation or if she's being dismissive of his pain.\n\nBut is distancing herself the wrong move? If she's not supporting him after he's vulnerable, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if she's genuinely not able to move past this and it's causing her distress, she's not obligated to stay. The question is whether her reaction is justified. The answer isn't black and white here. But since she's considering breaking up, perhaps she's being honest with her feelings, even if it's painful for him. \n\nSo, maybe she's not in the wrong because everyone has the right to their feelings, even if they change after learning something about their partner. The boyfriend might have a different perspective, but the author's actions are based on her own emotional response. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, since the user initially thought she's in the wrong, maybe the actual answer is A. Wait, no. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the author is experiencing a change in attraction and comfort, which is her right. So B.\n"
