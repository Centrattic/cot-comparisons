Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman distancing herself from her boyfriend after he reveals he was raped as a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend's trauma is significant and likely affects his current behavior and performance. The woman's reaction is to leave his apartment and feel less attracted to him. She's unsure if she can see him the same way. Her friend suggests staying, but she's contemplating a breakup.\n\nThe question is whether she's at fault. In relationships, when someone discloses a traumatic experience, especially one that challenges the other's perceptions (like a \"macho\" image), it's natural to feel shocked. However, the woman's immediate reaction is to leave and feel repulsed. That's a personal choice, but does it make her wrong?\n\nI think it's important to differentiate between being in the wrong and having conflicting feelings. The woman isn't necessarily at fault for feeling this way, but her response might be harmful. However, the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing. Since she hasn't done anything malicious\u2014like blaming him or being abusive\u2014her feelings, while hurtful, might not make her \"wrong.\" But in terms of empathy and support, her reaction could be seen as lacking. The correct answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
