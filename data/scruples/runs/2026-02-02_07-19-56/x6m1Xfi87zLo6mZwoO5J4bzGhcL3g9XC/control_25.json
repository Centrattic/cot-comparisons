Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the question is in the wrong. So the situation is about a woman who's been dating her boyfriend for 5 months. He's revealed that he was raped as a child, and now she's distancing herself from him. She's feeling weird seeing him the same way, not attracted anymore, and considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend disclosed a serious trauma from his past. That's a big deal. Being a rape victim is traumatic and can have lasting effects on a person's mental health and relationships. The woman is struggling with her feelings after this revelation. She thought he was this \"macho\" guy, and now that image is shattered. She's feeling weird seeing him text her and isn't as attracted as before.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if she can't accept her partner's past. People have different boundaries and comfort levels. Being honest about her feelings is important for both their well-being. If she can't move past this, it might not be a healthy relationship moving forward.\n\nOn the other hand, he's opening up about a traumatic experience, which requires trust. Her reaction could be seen as invalidating his experience. But she's also dealing with her own emotions and the sudden shift in her perception of him. It's possible she's not being inconsiderate, just struggling with her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If she can't support him through his trauma, it's fair for her to step back. However, she might need to communicate this clearly and compassionately. The fact that she's considering breaking up but hasn't done so yet shows she's trying to weigh things out. Her best friend's advice to try continuing the relationship might be well-intentioned, but ultimately, the decision lies with her.\n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. But the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's being honest about her feelings and not forcing the relationship, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The trauma of the rape is on him, and her reaction is a personal struggle she has to navigate. Her decision to distance herself isn't malicious but a reflection of her inability to cope with the new information. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
