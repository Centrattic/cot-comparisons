Hes also really dominant and works at a start up doing marketing. In general hes very smart, funny, yadda yadda you get it. I like him.\n\nHowever even though our sex life is good hes been having trouble performing starting a week and a half ago. I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before. We're not broken up yet but im considering it kinda. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about her boyfriend opening up about being raped as a child, and she's distancing herself. \n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She mentions that her boyfriend, who she describes as \"macho\" and dominant, suddenly reveals a traumatic past. She's shocked because his image doesn't match the victim of rape. She felt weird after, wasn't as attracted, and considered breaking up. She's conflicted because she understands the trauma but can't see him the same way.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is struggling with his performance issues, which might be linked to his trauma. He opened up to her in a vulnerable moment. The author left after the conversation, which might have hurt him. Her friend suggests giving it more time, but she's not feeling the same attraction.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, it's a sensitive situation. She wasn't abusive or mean, just not able to handle the change in perception. However, she didn't support him when he was most vulnerable. Distancing herself immediately after such a confession could be hurtful. But it's also valid that she's struggling with her feelings. \n\nThe key points are: she's not in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but maybe she should have handled it differently. The question is whether she's at fault. If the answer is about being wrong for not supporting him, then A. But if it's about it being a personal struggle and not entirely her fault, then B. Given that she's trying to process and hasn't broken up yet, maybe she's not in the wrong. So, B.\n"
