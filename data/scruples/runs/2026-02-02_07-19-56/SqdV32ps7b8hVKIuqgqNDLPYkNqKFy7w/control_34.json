I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family. The author is 21, back home for Spring Break, and the sister has been annoying them with questions, karate moves, and Nerf gun shots. The key points here are the age difference, the context of the situation, and the appropriateness of the reaction.\n\nFirst, the sister is 7 years old. At that age, children are still learning social boundaries and self-regulation. Even if she was being annoying, it's important to consider that her actions might be a normal part of childhood behavior. However, the author was dealing with multiple incidents over a few days, which might have built up their frustration. But does that justify a swear word directed at a younger sibling?\n\nThe phrase \"fuck off\" is a strong expletive. Even if it was a reactive outburst, using such language towards a child, especially in front of family, can be hurtful. The author mentions apologizing and the sister accepting it, but the mother is upset. The emotional impact on the sister, who is young, might be significant. Kids can internalize harsh words more than adults expect, leading to feelings of rejection or confusion.\n\nThe author is aware of their own tendency to curse, so they should be more mindful of their language around family, especially children. The fact that they felt the need to retreat to their room earlier shows they were already stressed, but the final trigger was the Nerf gun incident. However, even with provocation, the response should be proportionate. Screaming a curse word in front of others, especially in a family setting, is not an appropriate way to handle frustration.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a result of built-up frustration, but the method of handling it was inappropriate. They should have communicated their feelings without resorting to such language. The sister's age and the potential long-term effects of such a reaction make the author at fault here.\n"
