I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is 21, came back home for Spring Break, and had a sister who was being annoying. The sister was asking a lot of questions, doing karate moves on him, and then shooting him with a Nerf gun. The final straw was when she shot him in the ear, leading him to yell \"fuck off\" in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author admits they curse a lot in college but usually control it. The sister is 7, so she might not understand the severity of her actions. Kids this age can be hyperactive and might not realize they're being too much. The author was clearly frustrated, especially after being annoyed over multiple days. But the key point is the reaction. Shouting a strong curse word at a young sibling in front of family is probably not the best way to handle it, even if they were being a nuisance.\n\nThe author tried to apologize, but the sister ran off crying, and the mom is upset. Even if the sister was in a phase, the author's response was harsh. Using such a strong expletive, even if it's a common one in their family, might have been crossing a line. The fact that the sister is usually a great kid and the author felt bad afterward suggests they know it was wrong. The adults just acted like it didn't happen, which might mean they don't think it's a big deal, but the author's family dynamics are important. The sister could be affected by the language, and the author's frustration doesn't excuse the outburst. So, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't manage their frustration appropriately, especially given the sister's age and the situation.\n"
