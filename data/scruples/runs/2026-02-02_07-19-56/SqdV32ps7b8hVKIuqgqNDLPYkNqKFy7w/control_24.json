I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. So the scenario is that the author is 21, back from college, dealing with a younger sister who's been annoying them with questions and playing around with Nerf guns. The sister hits them with a Nerf bullet, and the author loses it, shouting an expletive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference and the context. The sister is 7, so she might not understand the severity of the situation. Kids that age are naturally playful and maybe don't realize when they're being annoying. The author mentions that the sister was doing Karate and playing with Nerf guns, which are typical kid activities. But the author is dealing with being away at college, so maybe they're more stressed or have less patience.\n\nThe key points here are the use of a strong expletive directed at a child. Even if the sister was being annoying, using \"fuck off\" is pretty harsh. The author did apologize and the sister accepted it, but the mom is upset. The author feels bad about it. \n\nI should think about whether the reaction was proportionate. The sister sneaked up and shot with a Nerf gun, which might have been the last straw. But the author had already been annoyed for a few days. However, using a swear word like that in front of family, especially towards a child, is generally considered inappropriate. The author also mentions that they usually control their language but this time lost their cool. \n\nThe answer probably leans towards the author being in the wrong because they used a strong expletive against a younger sibling in front of family. Even if the sister was being a nuisance, there are better ways to handle it. The author took responsibility and apologized, which is good, but the initial reaction was still wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
