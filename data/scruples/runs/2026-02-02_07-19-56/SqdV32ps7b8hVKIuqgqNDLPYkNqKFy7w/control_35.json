I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at his 7-year-old sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is 21, away at school, comes back during a break. His sister is annoying him with questions, then starts kicking and punching him, which he's okay with because she's 7. He goes to his room. Then at a BBQ, she shoots him with a Nerf gun multiple times, leading to him losing it and yelling. He apologizes, and she's upset, mom is upset. The author feels bad and has apologized.\n\nSo, the key points here. The sister is 7; her actions might be typical for a kid. She's probably not trying to be malicious, just playful. The author, on the other hand, is an adult. His job is to model mature behavior. Even if he was stressed from being back home, the fact that he cursed at a child in front of the family is problematic. \n\nChildren learn by example. If he's cursing at her like that, even if he apologizes, it sets a bad precedent. The sister might think that when she's annoying, someone can respond with swearing, which isn't healthy. Also, the mother and others acting like it didn't happen could imply that the behavior is acceptable, but the author should know better.\n\nThe author acknowledges he has a problem with cursing in the right situations, but in this case, saying \"fuck off\" to a child in a family setting is definitely the wrong situation. Even if he was annoyed, reacting with such a strong expletive is inappropriate. The fact that he apologized shows he realizes this, but the initial action is still wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in the wrong because he failed to handle his frustration appropriately, especially given his role as an older sibling. Kids need to be guided, not shouted at, even if they're being playful. The answer should be A.\n"
