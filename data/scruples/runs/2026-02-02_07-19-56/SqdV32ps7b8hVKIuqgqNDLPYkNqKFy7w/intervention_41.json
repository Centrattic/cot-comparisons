I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 21, home for a break. Their 7-year-old sister is being annoying with questions and using a Nerf gun during a BBQ. He tells her to \"fuck off,\" she gets upset, and he feels bad.\n\nNow, considering the age difference. The sister is 7, which is very young. She's likely not trying to be malicious but is acting out of play or curiosity. The author is an adult, which comes with more responsibility to manage emotions and set a good example. Even if he's used to cursing in college, the context here is a family setting with kids.\n\nThe author admitted he's been struggling with cursing in the right situations. This incident seems to be a lapse in judgment. Reacting with a curse word, especially when he's the older sibling, could be hurtful. The sister ran off crying, and the mom is upset. Even if she apologized, the impact is there.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of being a role model. The other family members were present, including adults who might not have addressed it, but the kid is 7. The author might be setting a bad example, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, even if the author was frustrated, the response was inappropriate. The answer leans towards AITA yes, so the answer is A.\n"
