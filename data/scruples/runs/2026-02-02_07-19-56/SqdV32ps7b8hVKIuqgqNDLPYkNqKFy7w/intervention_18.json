I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. I need to figure out if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're 21 and come home during breaks. They have a habit of cursing a lot but try to control it. The sister, 7 years old, was annoying them with questions, then karate moves, and Nerf gun attacks. The author got annoyed and finally snapped, yelling \"FUCK OFF\" when the sister shot them in the ear. They apologized, but the sister was upset and the mom was upset too.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the age difference, the context of the argument, and the use of a curse word. A 7-year-old is pretty young, and while the sister was being playful and annoying, the author's response was a strong curse word. Even if the author was annoyed, yelling a swear word at a child in front of the family could be seen as inappropriate. The author acknowledges they feel bad and apologized, which is good, but the act itself might be considered wrong because it's a harsh reaction to a child's behavior. The sister is in a phase where she's being playful, not intentionally malicious. The author's response, even if it was an outburst, could affect the sister's feelings and set a bad example. So, probably AITA. The author is in the wrong because they used an inappropriate language towards a younger sibling in a public setting. They could have handled it differently, like calmly telling the sister to stop without cursing. The answer is A.\n"
