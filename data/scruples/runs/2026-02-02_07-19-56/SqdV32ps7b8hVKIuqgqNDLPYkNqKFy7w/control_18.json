I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 21, back home during break, and their sister is being annoying. The sister is 7, so very young. The author mentions they curse a lot but usually control it. The situation builds up over a few days with the sister doing things like karate moves and Nerf gun attacks. The final trigger is the Nerf bullet to the ear, leading the author to yell \"FUCK OFF.\" They apologized, and the sister cried, and the mom is upset.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider the age difference, the context of the argument, and the appropriateness of the language. A 7-year-old might not understand the severity of that curse word, especially in front of family. The author did apologize, which shows some remorse. But the word used is extremely strong and could be traumatic for a young child. Even if the sister was annoying, the author's reaction might be considered over the top. The fact that the sister ran off crying and the mom is upset suggests that the outburst was not appropriate. Parents often model behavior, so using such language in front of a young sibling could set a bad example. The author might have handled it differently, maybe by removing themselves or talking calmly instead of yelling a curse word. So, I think the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
