I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. \n\nFirst, the author explains they're 21, back home for Spring Break, and their sister has been annoying them with questions and physical play. They mention they cursed a lot in college but usually control it. The situation builds over a few days with the sister's actions\u2014Karate moves, Nerf gun incidents\u2014and the author's reaction peaks when the sister shoots them in the ear, leading to the outburst.\n\nI need to consider the context. The sister is 7, so her behavior might be typical playful behavior, not malicious. The author was dealing with accumulated frustration over several days. However, using a strong swear word towards a child, even in a moment of anger, could be harmful. The sister then runs off crying, and the mother is upset. The author apologized, but the sister is still affected.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, how a parent handles such situations matters. Reacting with such a strong expletive could set a bad example and hurt the child, even if it was a reaction to provocation. The author might be in the wrong for not managing their temper and resorting to a harsh response instead of addressing the sister's behavior calmly. Even if the sister was annoying, the method of response is questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have had a build-up of stress, being home from college, and the sister's actions were persistent. But regardless, using such language in front of the family (and towards a child) is likely seen as inappropriate. The fact that the sister ran crying and the mother is upset suggests that the author's actions were impactful and hurtful.\n\nSo, considering the options, the author probably is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
