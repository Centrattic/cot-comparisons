I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 21-year-old who cursed at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family. \n\nFirst, the key points: The person is an adult, away at college, and comes home during breaks. Their sister, who's 7, is being annoying by asking questions and using a Nerf gun. The author tells her to \"fuck off,\" which caused her to cry and the mom to be upset. They apologized, and the sister accepted it but is still affected.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to say that. Let's consider the context. The sister is a child, and the author is an adult. Even if the sister was annoying, using such strong language directed at a child is problematic. Adults are expected to model appropriate behavior, especially towards younger family members. The author acknowledges they curse a lot but usually control it. In this case, they lost their temper. \n\nAlso, the sister's actions, while annoying, are typical for a 7-year-old. She might not understand the seriousness of her actions or the frustration of an older sibling. The author's reaction, however, is a clear example of an adult not managing their anger appropriately. Even if the sister was being persistent, the response was excessive. \n\nThe fact that the sister ran off crying and the mom is upset shows that the words had a negative impact. The author's apology might have resolved the immediate issue, but the emotional harm could linger. The author's own admission that they felt terrible afterward and that their sister is in shock indicates they recognize their mistake. \n\nIn family settings, especially with children present, such language can set a bad example and affect the child's behavior or perception of conflict resolution. The author's responsibility as an older sibling includes setting a good example, which they failed to do here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they used inappropriate language towards a child in a family setting, which is unwise and sets a poor example. The sister's behavior was not severe enough to justify such a strong reaction, and the author should have handled the situation with more patience and better communication.\n"
