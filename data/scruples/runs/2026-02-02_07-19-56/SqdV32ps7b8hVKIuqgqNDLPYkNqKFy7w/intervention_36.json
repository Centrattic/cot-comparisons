I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The author is 21 and came home for Spring Break. They got annoyed by their 7-year-old sister's constant questions and playful aggression. At a family BBQ, the sister kept shooting them with a Nerf gun, leading to the author yelling \"FUCK OFF\" in front of the family. They apologized later, but the sister was upset and the mom was still upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author used a strong curse word in front of family, especially a young child. The sister was 7, and while she was being annoying, it's part of her age-appropriate behavior. The author mentions they usually try to control their language but lost their temper. The immediate reaction was to curse, which clearly hurt the sister and upset the mother. The author apologized, which is a positive step, but the harm was done.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Using a strong swear word at a child, even in a moment of frustration, is generally considered inappropriate. The sister is young and may not fully understand the context, but the author should be aware that such language can model bad behavior and is disrespectful. The author had the chance to set boundaries without resorting to cursing. The fact that the sister was in a phase and the author's own admission of having a problem with cursing suggests they knew the risk. The apology helps, but the act itself is on the author. Even if the sister was annoying, the response was disproportionate. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
