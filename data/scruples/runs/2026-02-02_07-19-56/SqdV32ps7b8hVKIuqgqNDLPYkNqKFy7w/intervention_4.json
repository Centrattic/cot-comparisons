I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 21, back home during Spring Break. Their 7-year-old sister has been annoying them with questions, physical play (karate moves), and later, shooting them with a Nerf gun. After she shoots them in the ear despite previous warnings, the author reacts by yelling \"FUCK OFF\" in front of the whole family. They apologize but the sister is upset, and the mom is still upset.\n\nFirst, the author admits to using a lot of curse words in college but tries to control it. However, in this case, they lost their temper. The sister is young and might not realize the impact of the words. The author's reaction, while understandable in the heat of the moment, could be harmful. The phrase \"fuck off\" is a strong, derogatory term, especially towards a sibling who's only 7. Even if the sister was being annoying, the author's response is disproportionate. Kids that age often act out, but the way the author responded could affect the sister's self-esteem or how she perceives her older sibling. The fact that the sister ran off crying and the mom is upset suggests that the reaction was too harsh. The author did apologize, which is a good step, but the initial choice of words was inappropriate given the context and the sister's age. The author's responsibility as an older sibling is to model better behavior, even when frustrated. So, I think the author is in the wrong here.\n"
