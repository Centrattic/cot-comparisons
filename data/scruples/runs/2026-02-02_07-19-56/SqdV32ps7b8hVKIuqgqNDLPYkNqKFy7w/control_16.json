I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 21-year-old who told their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they curse a lot in college but try to control it. They came home for a break and were annoyed by their sister's behavior. The sister was being annoying with questions, karate moves, and a Nerf gun. The final trigger was being shot in the ear, leading to the outburst.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are the use of a swear word directed at a child in front of family. Even if the sister was being a bother, using such a strong expletive could be seen as inappropriate. The author did apologize, and the sister accepted it, but the mother is upset. \n\nChildren, especially younger ones, don't understand the weight of such words, and using them can be a bad influence. Also, the situation seems to be a culmination of annoyances, but reacting with a swear word in a public family setting is likely to cause more harm. The author admits they overreacted. \n\nThe answer would lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) being yes. The author made a poor choice in language, regardless of the provocation. Even if they were annoyed, there are better ways to handle it without using such a harsh word. The fact that they feel bad afterward and apologized is a plus, but the action itself is questionable.\n"
