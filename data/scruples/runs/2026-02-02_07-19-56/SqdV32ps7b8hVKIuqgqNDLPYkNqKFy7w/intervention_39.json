I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking whether the person who told their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family is in the wrong. The author is 21, back home for Spring Break, and has been annoyed by their sister's behavior over several days. The sister was doing Karate moves and later shooting a Nerf gun at them, leading to the outburst.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the use of a strong curse word towards a young child in front of family. Even if the author felt provoked, the choice of language is extreme. A 7-year-old likely doesn't understand the full gravity of that word, but the impact on her is clear\u2014she ran off crying and is in shock. The mother is upset, which adds to the concern. \n\nThe author did apologize, and the sister accepted it, but the emotional damage might linger. The situation could have been handled better without the curse word. The author admits to cursing like a sailor but claims to usually control it. This time, they didn't, and the context was a family setting with kids present. \n\nWhile the sister was being annoying, the reaction seems disproportionate. The author had previous chances to address the behavior calmly but escalated to a harsh verbal response. Even if they were frustrated, using such language is not appropriate, especially with a younger sibling and in front of family. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the response was excessive and could have been avoided with better conflict resolution.\n"
