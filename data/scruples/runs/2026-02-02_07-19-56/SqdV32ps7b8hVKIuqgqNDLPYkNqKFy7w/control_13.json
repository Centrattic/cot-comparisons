I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at their 7-year-old sister in front of family. The story says the sister was being annoying, doing karate moves, and shooting Nerf guns. The author got annoyed, tried to go to their room, then at a BBQ, the sister snuck up and shot them, leading to the outburst.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age difference and the context. The sister is 7, so a young child. The author is 21, an adult. The sister's actions, while maybe annoying, are typical playful behavior. Kids that age don't understand the concept of being annoying in the same way adults do; they're just being kids. The author mentions they usually control their cursing but lost their temper here. \n\nSaying \"fuck off\" to a child, even in a moment of frustration, is pretty harsh. The author acknowledges feeling terrible and apologizing, which shows they recognize it was wrong. The sister was upset and crying, which indicates the impact was hurtful. The mom being upset also points to the family's disapproval.\n\nEven though the author had built-up frustration, the response was disproportionate. A 7-year-old isn't trying to provoke an adult intentionally; they're just playing. The author could have handled it by setting boundaries without using such strong language. The fact that the family just acted like it didn't happen might be them trying to protect the child's feelings, but the damage was done.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was just to stop the behavior, the method was inappropriate. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because using that kind of language towards a child, especially in front of others, is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation.\n"
