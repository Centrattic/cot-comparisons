I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. The author is 21, back home for Spring Break, and has been dealing with their sister's constant annoying behavior. The sister started kicking and punching them after taking up karate, then used a Nerf gun during a BBQ, leading to the outburst.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the language. Cursing at a child, even in a moment of frustration, is generally seen as inappropriate, especially in front of family. The sister is young, so using such a strong expletive could be hurtful and set a bad example. The author realizes this and apologizes, which is a positive step, but the initial reaction still matters.\n\nNext, the context: the author mentions they curse a lot in college but try to control it. However, being around a younger sibling might require more restraint. The sister's actions were annoying but not malicious\u2014harmless kid stuff. The author tried to avoid her, but the final trigger was the Nerf gun incident. Still, reacting with a curse word led to the sister crying and the mother being upset.\n\nThe key points are the age difference, the use of strong language, and the impact on the sister. While the author did apologize, the act of cursing at a child in that situation is typically viewed as wrong because it can be traumatic and model poor communication. The author's frustration is understandable, but the response wasn't appropriate. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
