I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 21-year-old who said \"fuck off\" to their 7-year-old sister in front of the family. The author is seeking advice on whether they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they curse a lot in college but try to control it. The sister was being annoying with questions and physical play, leading to frustration. The final trigger was a Nerf gun shot, prompting the outburst. The author apologized, and the sister accepted it but is still upset, and the mom is upset too.\n\nSo, the key points here are the use of a swear word directed at a young child in a family setting. Even if the author was frustrated, using such strong language in front of family, especially towards a sibling, is likely to be seen as inappropriate. The sister is only 7, so she might not understand the impact, but the family's reaction suggests it was a big deal. The fact that the author felt terrible afterward and apologized shows they recognize the issue, but the act itself is problematic.\n\nThe author might argue they were stressed and had a bad day, but that doesn't justify the language. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. From a general perspective, using such a term in that context is usually considered wrong, especially because it's a family setting and the sister is young. The answer is probably A (yes, in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe cultural differences? But the user didn't mention that. The author's own guilt and the family's reaction support that it was wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
