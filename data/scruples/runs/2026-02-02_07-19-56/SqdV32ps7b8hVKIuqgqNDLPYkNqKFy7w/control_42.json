I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 21, back from college for Spring Break. The sister, age 7, is being annoying with questions, karate moves, and a Nerf gun. The author ends up yelling \"FUCK OFF\" after she shoots him in the ear, leading to the sister crying and the author apologizing.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author used a strong curse word directed at a young sibling in front of family. Even if they were annoyed, the response seems disproportionate. The sister is a child, and using such language can be harmful. The author acknowledges that they have a problem with cursing and usually control it, but here they lost it. The sister ran off crying, and the mom is upset. The author apologized, but the sister is still in shock. \n\nFrom a typical societal perspective, even if there's provocation, yelling a curse at a child is considered inappropriate. It's important to model better behavior, especially around children. The author's actions could affect their sister's emotional well-being and set a bad example. Even if the sister was being a bit too much, the response was harsh. The author admits they lost their temper, which suggests they recognize the wrongdoing. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister was playing and maybe not intentionally being malicious. The author tried to apologize, which shows remorse. But the act itself is still problematic. So, even though there's context, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
