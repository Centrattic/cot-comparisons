I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is 21, away at college, and only home during breaks. The sister is 7, which is a young age where kids can be persistent and not realize how their actions affect others. The author mentions that the sister was annoying them with questions, then started physically messing around with Karate moves and a Nerf gun. The final trigger was the Nerf shot to the ear, leading to the outburst.\n\nNow, considering the age gap: 21 vs. 7. The author is an adult, which means they're expected to handle situations with more maturity and self-control. Kids, especially at 7, don't have the same emotional regulation. The author might have been stressed from being back home and dealing with the sister's behavior, but the response was to use a strong curse word directed at a child. \n\nThe key points here are the use of a vulgar term and the context. Even if the sister was being annoying, the appropriate response, especially in front of the family, would be to calmly address the behavior. The author acknowledges that they curse a lot but try to control it. However, in this case, the curse word was both loud and directed at a child they care about, causing her to cry. \n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the author feels bad, apologized, and the sister accepted it but was in shock. The mom is upset. This indicates that the action had a negative impact, even if it was a momentary reaction. \n\nFrom a societal or moral standpoint, using such language towards a younger sibling, even in frustration, is often seen as inappropriate. Adults are expected to model better behavior and handle conflicts without resorting to harsh language. The fact that the author's sister is in a phase might explain some of her behavior, but it doesn't justify the adult's outburst. \n\nSo, while the author might have been frustrated, the response was disproportionate and hurtful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
