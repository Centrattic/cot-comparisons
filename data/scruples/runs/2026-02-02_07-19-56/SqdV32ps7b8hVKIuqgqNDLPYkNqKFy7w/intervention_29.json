I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by looking at the situation they described. The author is 21, came back home for Spring Break, and their 7-year-old sister has been annoying them with questions, karate moves, and a Nerf gun. The final straw was when the sister shot them in the ear with a Nerf bullet, leading the author to yell \"FUCK OFF\" in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the sister's actions: she's a kid, 7 years old. Kids often don't know their own strength and can be persistent, but they're not doing it with malice. The author mentions she was doing karate and practicing on them, which is playful but maybe overwhelming after a long time away. The Nerf gun incident happened when she snuck up from behind, which startled the author. However, the author had already been annoyed throughout the visit, leading up to that moment.\n\nNow, the author's response: telling a 7-year-old to \"fuck off\" in front of family. That's a strong swear word, and even though they apologize afterward, the impact is there. The sister was upset and ran crying, and the mom is upset too. The author feels bad and realizes they overreacted. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they had prior annoyance, but the final trigger was the Nerf bullet. However, the author chose a harsh response. Kids can be annoying, but using such a strong swear word is probably excessive. The sister is young and might not understand the full meaning yet, but the adults present would, and it sets a bad example. The author also acknowledges they curse a lot in college but try to control it, which suggests they know it's not appropriate in all situations. \n\nThe key points here are the escalation of annoyance over days, the final trigger, and the response. The author could have handled the situation differently, maybe by calmly setting boundaries or removing themselves. Yelling a swear word, even in frustration, is an adult's way of handling a child's behavior, which isn't the best approach. The sister was in a phase, as the author noted, so patience might be needed. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was stressed from being home, dealing with multiple annoyances. It's a moment of losing control. However, the responsibility is on the adult to manage their reactions. The sister didn't mean harm, just playfully annoying, and the author's response was disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because they used an inappropriate and harsh response to a child's behavior, even if they were annoyed. They should have found a better way to handle it.\n"
