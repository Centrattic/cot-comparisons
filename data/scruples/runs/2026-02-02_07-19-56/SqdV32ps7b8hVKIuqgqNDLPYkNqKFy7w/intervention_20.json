I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old who said \"fuck off\" to their 7-year-old sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they curse a lot in college but try to control it. The sister was annoying them with questions and physical play, which built up over time. The final trigger was a Nerf gun shot, leading to the outburst.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference, the escalation of annoyance, and the use of a strong curse word. The sister is very young, and while she was being a bit of a pest, her actions are typical for a child. The author, being an adult, is expected to handle frustration better. Saying \"fuck off\" is not appropriate, especially around children. Even though the family was present, the impact on the sister running off crying and the mother being upset suggests it was a significant misstep.\n\nThe author did apologize, which is a good step, but the initial reaction is problematic. Adults should model better behavior and find non-harmful ways to deal with irritation, especially around kids. The sister's age and the fact that she's in a phase might mean she doesn't fully understand the severity, but the author's responsibility is higher.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). They should have managed their frustration without using such a strong curse word, especially towards a younger sibling.\n"
