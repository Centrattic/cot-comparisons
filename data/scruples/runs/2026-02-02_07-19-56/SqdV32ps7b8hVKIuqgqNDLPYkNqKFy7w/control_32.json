I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. The story says the sister was annoying the author with questions and then started playing with a Nerf gun, shooting them, leading to the author losing their temper.\n\nFirst, the age difference is significant. The author is 21 and the sister is 7. Kids that young are naturally going to be curious and maybe a bit annoying, but it's also part of their development. The author mentions they go to college far away, so maybe they're used to an environment where they can handle their own space, but being home with family changes the dynamic. \n\nThe sister's actions were playful, like karate moves and Nerf gun shooting. The author tried to tell her to stop, but when she kept doing it, they snapped. The key issue here is using a very harsh swear word in front of family, especially directed at a child. Even if the author was annoyed, reacting with such strong language could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nChildren don't understand the nuances of cursing and the author's outburst might have scared or confused the sister. The fact that the sister ran in crying and the mom is upset shows that the reaction was impactful. Also, the author did apologize, which is a good step, but the initial response was problematic. \n\nThe family environment is important here. Since it's a family gathering, maintaining a respectful atmosphere is necessary, especially around children. The author might be used to cursing casually among peers, but in a family setting with a young child, that's different. The author's responsibility as an older sibling is to set a good example, not to react with aggression when frustrated.\n\nSo, even if the sister was being annoying, the author's choice of words was excessive. It's the author's responsibility to manage their temper and find a better way to handle the situation without using harsh language. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
