I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. The author explains they were annoyed with their sister's behavior upon returning from college. They mention the sister was annoying with questions and playing too rough with Nerf guns. The incident happened at a family BBQ when the sister shot them with a Nerf bullet, leading the author to snap and use a curse word.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 21, coming home from college, and used to cursing in certain situations. The sister is 7, so she's probably not intentionally trying to provoke them. The author tried to avoid her after being annoyed but then the situation escalated. The key here is the use of a strong expletive towards a young sibling in front of family and adults. \n\nEven if the author was frustrated, using such a harsh word towards a child, especially a sibling they usually get along with, is problematic. The sister was in a phase of being hyperactive, but that doesn't justify the response. The author did apologize, which is good, but the act itself might still be considered wrong because of the impact on the sister and family. The sister was hurt and ran off crying, and the mom is upset. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were in a situation where they were expected to act as a role model, especially in front of family. Using profanity in that context, even if in a moment of frustration, isn't appropriate. So, even though the author had built-up frustration, the response was excessive and harmful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
