I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who's 21, telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the whole family. The sister was acting annoying with questions and then using a Nerf gun to shoot them repeatedly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is aware that they curse at college and have to be careful. They came back from school, and their sister was pestering them with questions. Then she started kicking and punching them from her Karate class. The author tried to avoid her by going to their room. The next day at a BBQ, the sister found a Nerf gun and kept shooting them, leading to the outburst. The author apologized, but the sister was upset, and the mom is still mad.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. Let me think. The main issue is the use of a curse word towards a young child in front of family. Even if the sister was annoying, the response is extreme. 7-year-olds often act out, and it's part of their development. The author should have handled it without resorting to profanity, especially since they were aware of their own tendency. The fact that the sister was in a phase and the author lost their temper under accumulated stress might be a factor, but the key is the choice of words and the public setting. The mom's reaction suggests it was a big deal. So, even if the sister was being a bit much, the author's use of \"fuck off\" seems inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, in the wrong). They could have redirected the situation without using a curse word.\n"
