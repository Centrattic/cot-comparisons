I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a 21-year-old in college who's home for Spring Break. They came back and their 7-year-old sister started annoying them with a bunch of questions and then started using a Nerf gun to shoot them. The author ends up yelling \"fuck off\" in front of the family, which makes the sister cry and the mom upset. They apologize and the sister accepted it, but the family is acting like it didn't happen except the mom is still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference. The sister is 7, so she's probably not understanding the severity of the situation. She's doing things that are typical for her age, like trying to play and maybe not respecting boundaries. The author is 21, so they're an adult, and they're used to cursing at college but try to hold back. However, in this moment, they lost their temper. \n\nThe key points are: the sister was annoying the author with harmless but maybe excessive questions and play. The author tried to stop her by telling her to stop, but then the sister kept going, leading the author to yell a curse word. The sister got upset, and the mom is upset. \n\nI have to think about whether the author's reaction was appropriate. Even though the sister was acting out, the author is an adult. Reacting with a strong curse word in front of the entire family, especially with a young child, is probably not the best approach. The sister might not understand the meaning, but the mom and others would. The author's frustration is understandable, but using such a strong word could have been hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author tried to apologize, which shows they recognized the mistake. However, the question is whether they were in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on the appropriateness of the language used. Even if the sister was annoying, the author should have controlled their temper better. The phrase \"fuck off\" is pretty harsh and not suitable for a family setting with young kids. \n\nSo the answer would be A. The author is in the wrong because they used inappropriate language in response to their sister's behavior, even if they were frustrated. As an adult, they should have handled it differently, maybe by calmly explaining that the language was wrong or setting boundaries without cursing.\n"
