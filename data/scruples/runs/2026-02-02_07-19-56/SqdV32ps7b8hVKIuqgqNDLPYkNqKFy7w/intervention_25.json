I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old sibling telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family after being annoyed by her actions during a family BBQ. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an adult and the sister is a child. The author was around and helping with the BBQ, which is a family event where kids are present. The sister was being playful but persistent, using a Nerf gun after being told to stop. The author then reacts with a strong expletive, causing the sister to cry and the mom to be upset.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, using a swear word like \"fuck off\" in front of a young child is typically considered inappropriate, especially by an older sibling. Even if the author was annoyed, the response was harsh and could be seen as disrespectful. The sister is 7, so the exposure to such language might be harmful, and the author's role as an older sibling adds responsibility to set a good example.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize after the fact, and the sister accepted it. The context includes the author being in a break and returning home, which might mean they're adjusting after time away. But even so, the reaction was immediate and unprofessional. The author also mentioned they usually try to control their language but might have a problem with it. That self-awareness is there, but the slip-up happened in a sensitive setting.\n\nThe family's reaction was to act like nothing happened, which might not help the sister understand the gravity. The author should have found a better way to handle the frustration, maybe setting boundaries without using such language. The fact that the sister was in a phase of being more persistent doesn't justify the reactive expletive. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because using that kind of language towards a child in a family setting is inappropriate and disrespectful, regardless of their usual behavior or the sister's actions. The adult should model better behavior and handle the situation without resorting to swearing.\n"
