I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is 21, back home for Spring Break, and has a 7-year-old sister who's been annoying them with questions, karate moves, and Nerf gun attacks. The final straw was the Nerf bullet to the ear, prompting the outburst. \n\nThe key points here are the age gap and the appropriateness of the reaction. The sister is a child, and even if she's being annoying, using a strong swear word like \"fuck off\" is likely inappropriate. The author mentions they usually watch their language, which makes this outburst more concerning. \n\nChildren at 7 don't have the same understanding of consequences as adults. The sister might not grasp why the swear word is hurtful, but the emotional impact is still significant. The fact that she ran in crying shows she was upset. The mom being upset adds another layer, as the parent's reaction matters too.\n\nEven if the author felt provoked, the response was disproportionate. The sister's actions, while annoying, aren't malicious. The author could have handled it with more patience or set boundaries without using such strong language. The aftermath, where the sister is in shock and the mom is upset, indicates that the outburst was harmful despite the apology.\n\nAlso, the author's age and the context of being home from college might contribute to stress, but that doesn't justify the reaction. The responsibility is on the adult to manage their emotions and respond appropriately. The fact that they apologized and felt bad later shows they recognize the mistake, but the action itself was wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
