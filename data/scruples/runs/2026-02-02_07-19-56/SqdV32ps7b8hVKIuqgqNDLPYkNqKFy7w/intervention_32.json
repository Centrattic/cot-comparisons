I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation as described. The author is 21, back home for Spring Break, and dealing with their 7-year-old sister who's been annoying them with questions, physical play, and using a Nerf gun. The final incident is when the sister sneaks up and shoots them with the Nerf bullet, leading the author to yell \"FUCK OFF\" and then apologize.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The sister is 7, so her actions are probably age-appropriate in terms of wanting attention or playing. The author mentions they curse in college but try to control it. However, yelling a curse word at a young sibling in front of family, even in frustration, could be hurtful. \n\nThe author did apologize, and the sister accepted it but seems shocked. The mother is upset. From a parenting perspective, using such language toward a child, even if the child is being annoying, might set a bad example and could affect the child's emotional well-being. \n\nBut the author also mentions they were frustrated after a build-up of incidents. However, even if they were annoyed, shouting a curse word at a 7-year-old isn't appropriate. There might be better ways to handle frustration, like walking away or setting boundaries without verbal aggression.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's action, while understandable in the context of frustration, is still inappropriate. The use of a strong curse word directed at a sibling in that way is likely hurtful and not the right approach. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
