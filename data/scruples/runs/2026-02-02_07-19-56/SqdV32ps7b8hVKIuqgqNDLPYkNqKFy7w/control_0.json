I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is 21, comes home from college where they curse a lot but usually manage it. The sister, 7, is being annoying with questions and physically bothering them with karate moves and a Nerf gun. The author tells her to \"fuck off,\" which upsets the sister and the mom. The author apologized and the sister accepted, but there's lingering feelings.\n\nSo, key points here: The sister is very young. Even if she was being a pest, using a strong swear word in front of family isn't appropriate. The author admits to having a problem with cursing but says they usually control it. This situation escalated because of repeated annoyances. However, a 7-year-old doesn't understand the severity of a swear word in the same way adults do. The author's reaction might be over the top, especially given the child's age. The fact that the author felt the need to curse in front of the family suggests poor impulse control, even if they were upset. \n\nAlso, the family's reaction\u2014acting like it didn't happen but the mom being upset\u2014shows that maybe the family doesn't condone such language, even in the heat of the moment. The author's responsibility as an older sibling to model good behavior is important here. Even if the sister was annoying, there are better ways to handle it without using profanity directed at a child.\n\nSo, while the author might have had a bad day and was stressed, the use of that specific language is problematic. The answer is likely A (they're in the wrong) because using such strong language towards a young child in a family setting is inappropriate, regardless of the provocation. The author could have set a better example and found another way to address the situation.\n"
