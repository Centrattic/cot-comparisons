I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 21, back home for Spring Break. Their 7-year-old sister has been annoying them with questions, karate moves, and a Nerf gun. The final straw is when she shoots him in the ear, leading to the outburst.\n\nThe author did apologize and the sister accepted, but the mom is upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\nChildren, especially young ones, don't understand the full impact of such language. The author was annoyed, but reacting with a curse word could be hurtful. Even if the sister was being a bit too much, the author is an adult who should model better behavior. The sister might be in a phase, but that doesn't justify the outburst. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they usually control their cursing. This incident happened in a moment of frustration, but the consequence is that a young child heard a strong swear word from a sibling. That could affect her perception of acceptable behavior. The author's responsibility as an older sibling includes setting a good example. \n\nEven though the sister was being annoying, the author's reaction could be seen as over the top. The fact that they immediately apologized shows they realized their mistake, but the action itself still impacts the sister and family. The mother's upset reaction indicates that the family values different behavior. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author had a build-up of frustration, the use of a swear word towards a child isn't appropriate. It's important to manage frustration in a way that doesn't harm younger siblings. The author's actions, though regretted and apologized for, were still a misstep. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. They should have found a different way to handle their annoyance without using such language, especially around a child.\n"
