I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who's 21, coming home for Spring Break and getting annoyed by their 7-year-old sister's constant attention and playfulness. The sister does things like asking questions, practicing karate moves, and shooting a Nerf gun. The author ends up yelling \"fuck off\" in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is very young, so her behavior is typical for a child. The author mentions they curse a lot in college but try to control it. The sister's actions are harmless but repetitive, leading to the author losing their temper. The main issue here is the use of a swear word directed at a child in front of the family.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, using a strong swear word like \"fuck off\" towards a sibling, especially a young one, is generally considered inappropriate. Even if there's frustration, the language used can be hurtful and sets a bad example. The sister is still a child, and such language can affect her emotionally. The fact that the sister ran away crying and the mom is upset shows the impact of the outburst. The author did apologize and the sister accepted it, but the emotional damage might linger.\n\nThe author might argue that the sister was annoying and that they were stressed from being away at school. However, the responsibility lies on the older sibling to manage their reactions. There are better ways to handle frustration without resorting to harsh language, especially around children and in front of family. The author's actions might be seen as overreacting, given the sister's age and the nature of her behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the use of inappropriate language, the context of it being directed at a young sibling, and the emotional fallout. The author's frustration is understandable, but the response was not appropriate. So the answer should be A.\n"
