I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of family. The situation involves the sister annoying the author with questions and playing around, leading to the outburst.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 21, away at college, and only home during breaks. The sister is 7, so young, and maybe not understanding boundaries. The author mentions they curse a lot but try to control it. The sister was shooting them with a Nerf gun, which they found annoying, and the final trigger was a shot to the ear. The author then yelled \"FUCK OFF,\" which is a strong expletive.\n\nThe key points here are the use of a harsh swear word directed at a child, especially in front of family. Even if the author felt annoyed, using such language could be seen as inappropriate. Children learn from what they hear, and using strong language towards them, even in frustration, sets a bad example. Also, the sister was upset afterward, and the mother was upset. The author did apologize, but the action itself is problematic.\n\nHowever, the author might have had a build-up of frustration. The sister was persistent in her behavior, and the author was already stressed from being back home. The author's intent was to stop the sister, but the choice of words was excessive. It's possible the author lost control momentarily.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, even if the situation was frustrating, the response was not proportionate. Telling a child to \"fuck off\" is a strong reaction that could harm the relationship and the child's emotional well-being. The author should have found a better way to communicate their frustration without using such language. The fact that the sister was young and the outburst happened in front of family adds to the severity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the use of that language is inappropriate towards a child, even if the situation was frustrating. The author could have handled it differently, and the impact on the sister and family is a concern.\n"
