I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old who told their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. The key points here are the age difference, the context of the sibling interaction, and the use of a strong expletive.\n\nFirst, the sister is just seven years old. Kids at that age often have short attention spans and might not understand the boundaries of appropriate behavior. They can be annoying without intending to be, and their actions are usually not malicious. The author mentions that the sister was doing harmless things like asking questions and playing with Nerf guns. While it's understandable to get annoyed, especially after being around for a while, the response of yelling a curse word seems harsh for the situation.\n\nThe author also mentions they're used to cursing in college but are trying to use it appropriately. However, in front of a child and family members, using such language is inappropriate. The sister was in a phase where she was more active, but the author's reaction escalated the situation. Even though they apologized and the sister accepted it, the emotional impact on a young child of hearing their older sibling curse at them can be significant. The mother's upset reaction also indicates that the family values different behavior in such situations.\n\nThe author tried to apologize, which is a good step, but the act itself is still problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the age difference, and the impact on the sister and family, it seems like the author did make a mistake. The answer should be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
