I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. The situation is that the 21-year-old is home for Spring Break, and the sister has been annoying them with questions and physical play like kicking and punching. Then, at a BBQ, the sister uses a Nerf gun, and after being told to stop, she shoots the author, leading them to yell \"FUCK OFF.\" The sister runs in crying, and the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author's actions were appropriate. The key factors here are the age of the sister, the context of the situation, and the severity of the response. The sister is only 7, so using a strong swear word like that could be very hurtful and confusing for her. Even if the author was annoyed, the choice of language is extreme for a child's behavior. \n\nThe author mentions they usually avoid cursing in the right situations but might have a problem. However, being in front of the entire family, including adults and possibly younger kids, makes this a public setting where such language might be considered inappropriate. The sister was trying to interact, even if it was annoying, and the author's reaction was a loud curse. \n\nWhile the sister's actions (shooting with a Nerf gun) might be playful, the author's reaction could have lasting effects on the child. The sister is described as usually great, so maybe the author overreacted. Apologizing is a step, but the fact that the sister was shocked suggests that the language was not acceptable. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong here. The use of a strong swear word towards a young sibling in a family setting is just not appropriate. Kids can be annoying, but the response should be proportionate. The author could have handled it without cursing, especially since they were home where they know the family is. The mom being upset also indicates that the author's actions were against family expectations. So, the answer should be A.\n"
