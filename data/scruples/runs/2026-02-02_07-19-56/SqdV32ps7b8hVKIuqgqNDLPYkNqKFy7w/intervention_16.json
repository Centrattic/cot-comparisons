I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family is in the wrong. The author is 21, and they're asking for an opinion on whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister is annoying the author with questions and physical play (karate moves, Nerf gun). The author is stressed from being back with the family and the sister's behavior builds up over days. The final trigger is the Nerf gun shot to the ear, leading to the outburst. The author apologizes but the sister is upset, and the mom is still upset.\n\nNow, considering the age difference. The sister is 7, so she's a child. She might not understand the severity of the language or the situation. The author is an adult, which comes with responsibility. Using a strong curse word like \"fuck off\" in front of a child is problematic because it's inappropriate and could affect her emotionally. Even if the author was annoyed, the response was harsh and could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they usually try to control their cursing. This incident suggests a lapse in judgment, especially in a family setting. The sister might feel hurt or scared, and the mom's reaction indicates that the language was out of line. \n\nHowever, the sister's behavior was persistent. She kept annoying the author despite being told to stop. The author tried to avoid conflict by going to their room. But the final action was reactive, and the word used is extremely strong for a situation that, while frustrating, isn't a severe issue. \n\nConsidering all this, the author should have found a better way to handle the situation. The outburst was a moment of losing control and using inappropriate language in front of a child. So, I think the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
