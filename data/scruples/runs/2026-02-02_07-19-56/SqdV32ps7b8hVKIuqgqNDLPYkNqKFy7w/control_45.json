I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 21, went back home for Spring Break and got annoyed with their 7-year-old sister. The sister was annoying them with questions and then started playing roughly, like kicking and punching. Then at a family BBQ, she shot them with a Nerf gun, which made them lose their temper and say \"fuck off\" in front of everyone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference and the context. The sister is only 7, so her behavior might be typical for a kid being playful or testing boundaries. The author is an adult who's used to a different environment, maybe more independent, so coming home and dealing with a younger sibling's antics might be more frustrating. But even so, an adult's reaction should be measured, right?\n\nThe key point here is the use of a strong swear word towards a young child in front of the family. Even if the author was annoyed, shouting \"fuck off\" might be too harsh. Kids can't control their behavior as much as adults, and the author had the responsibility to manage their temper. The sister ended up crying and was in shock, which shows the impact of the outburst. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they've apologized and the sister accepted it, but the mother is upset. That suggests that the family might value respect and communication, and the author's reaction didn't align with that. Even if the sister was being annoying, there are better ways to handle it without using such language. Maybe setting boundaries without swearing could have been better. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's reaction was inappropriate. They could have found another way to address the situation without hurting their sister. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
