I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. The person is 21, home for Spring Break, and has been dealing with their sister's annoying behavior over several days. They mention that they usually curse a lot but try to control it. The situation builds up with the sister's actions, leading to the outburst.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is 7, so her actions are probably just playful but persistent. The author was annoyed over multiple instances, leading to losing their temper. However, using a strong curse word like \"fuck off\" in front of the family, especially with a child present, is a big issue. Even if they apologized and the sister accepted it, the impact on the child and family dynamics matters. \n\nChildren can be sensitive, and hearing a parent or sibling use that language can be hurtful and confusing. The author might have overreacted, even if they were stressed. The fact that the sister ran off crying shows the emotional impact. The mom being upset also indicates that the family values appropriateness in communication, especially with kids.\n\nThe author did apologize, which is a good step, but the act itself is problematic. It's about whether the reaction was proportionate. While the sister was annoying, the response was harsh and unprofessional, especially in front of others. The author's history of cursing might explain it, but not excuse it in this context. So, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
