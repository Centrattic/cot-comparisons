I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 21, back home for Spring Break. The sister is being annoying with questions and physical play (karate, Nerf gun). The author, who curses in college, uses a strong expletive when the sister shoots him with a Nerf bullet, causing her to cry. The author apologizes, and the sister accepts it but is still upset, and the mom is upset.\n\nSo, the main points here are the age difference, the context of the argument, and the use of a swear word directed at a young child in front of family. \n\nThe key factors to consider are: \n1. The appropriateness of the language used towards a 7-year-old. Even if the sister was being annoying, reacting with a strong swear word is probably excessive and could be hurtful, especially for a child.\n2. The author's responsibility as an older sibling to model appropriate behavior. Using such language might set a bad example and affect the child's emotional well-being.\n3. The fact that the sister was just playing and not intentionally trying to provoke, even if she was annoying. The author's reaction might be seen as over-the-top, given the context.\n4. The impact on the family environment. The mom being upset and the sister being in shock shows that the comment had negative consequences.\n\nEven though the author was annoyed and had been dealing with the sister's actions all break, the choice of words was likely not appropriate. The sister is young, so she might take the words more personally and seriously. The author might have a right to feel frustrated, but the way they expressed it was harmful. \n\nAlso, considering that the author is an adult and the sister is a child, the expectation is that the adult should handle the situation with more maturity. Apologizing helps, but the initial action is still questionable. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because using such strong language towards a young sibling in front of family is inappropriate and hurtful, regardless of the provocation.\n"
