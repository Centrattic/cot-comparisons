I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and went back home for Spring Break. They have a 7-year-old sister who's been annoying them since they arrived. The sister is doing karate and playfully attacking them, which is normal for a kid, but the user is getting annoyed. Then at a family BBQ, the sister uses a Nerf gun, and after multiple instances of the sister provoking them, the user snaps and yells \"fuck off\" in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the user's behavior: swearing in front of a 7-year-old and the entire family. Even if the sister is being a bit much, the user is an adult. Kids can be annoying, but the response was a strong curse word. The user acknowledges they have a problem with cursing and usually control it. This time, they lost their temper.\n\nThe sister's perspective: She's a child, maybe in a phase of seeking attention. Her actions (play fighting, Nerf gun) are typical kid behavior. The user's reaction might have been too harsh, especially in front of the family, which could embarrass the sister and upset the parents.\n\nThe user apologized, which is good, but the sister is still affected. The mom is upset, which shows the impact of the outburst. Even if the user felt provoked, reacting with a curse word is unwise, especially in front of a child. Adults are expected to model better behavior.\n\nIs there any justification? The user was stressed from being away, dealing with the sister's attention-seeking, and maybe feeling overwhelmed. But that doesn't excuse the language. The sister's actions, while annoying, don't warrant a strong curse word. The user could have handled it differently, like walking away or using a timeout without the outburst.\n\nAlternative actions: Telling the sister to stop calmly, removing herself from the situation without yelling. The user might have been in a phase where they needed space, but the reaction crossed a line.\n\nSo, the user is in the wrong because they used inappropriate language in front of a child and the family, even if provoked. The responsibility is on the adult to manage their response better.\n"
