I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 21, back home for Spring Break. They mention cursing a lot in college but usually control it. The sister is being annoying with questions and then uses a Nerf gun to shoot them, which is typical kid behavior. The author gets annoyed over time, builds up frustration, and finally snaps, yelling the expletive. They apologized and the sister accepted it, but the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference and the context. A 7-year-old is young and might not understand the severity of the situation. The author was stressed from being back home, dealing with the sister's behavior over multiple days. The sister's actions (Nerf gun, karate moves) are playful but persistent. The author reacted in the heat of the moment, which is a common trigger for such outbursts.\n\nHowever, using a strong expletive, especially \"fuck off,\" is harsh. Even if it's a moment of frustration, the language used can have a lasting impact on a child. The sister cried and was in shock, indicating the word was hurtful. The mom's upset reaction also suggests that the family environment values not using such language in front of children.\n\nThe author did apologize, which is a positive step. But the question is about whether they were wrong. In most cases, using explicit language towards a sibling, especially a younger one, is seen as inappropriate. Parents and older siblings are role models, and such language can affect a child's development and perception of acceptable behavior.\n\nEven if the author was building up frustration, the response was disproportionate. The sister's actions were playful, not malicious. The author could have handled it with more patience or redirected the sister's energy instead of reacting with a curse word.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. They used a harsh expletive that hurt their sister and upset the mother. While the situation was stressful, the reaction was not appropriate for the context. The answer should be A.\n"
