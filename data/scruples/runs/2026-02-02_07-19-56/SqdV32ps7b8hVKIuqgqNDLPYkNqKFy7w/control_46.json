I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author, who's 21, used a curse word (\"fuck off\") at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family. The situation involves the sister annoying them with questions, physical play, and a Nerf gun incident. The author apologized, and the sister accepted it but is still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult, and the sister is a child. Using such a strong curse word, even in frustration, is likely to be hurtful to a young child. The sister was just playing and might not have intended to provoke a strong reaction. The author admits to cursing a lot in college but says they usually control it. This time, they lost their temper. \n\nThe key factors here are the age gap, the use of a curse word towards a child, and the immediate regret and apology. Even though the author apologized, the act itself is problematic because it's a harsh response to a child's behavior. The sister is in a phase where she's exploring her independence, which is typical for her age. The author's frustration built up over several incidents, but reacting with such a strong expletive isn't appropriate, especially in front of family and adults.\n\nAlso, the mother is upset, indicating that the author's words had a significant impact on the family dynamics. The sister being shocked and crying further shows the emotional impact. While the author tried to make amends, the initial reaction was unkind and could affect the sister's self-esteem or how the family perceives the author's behavior. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were wrong. They had the capacity to manage their frustration but chose a harmful response. Even if the sister was annoying, the use of a curse word is not an appropriate way to address it. The author should model better behavior for the younger sibling, especially since they are an adult.\n\nSo, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
