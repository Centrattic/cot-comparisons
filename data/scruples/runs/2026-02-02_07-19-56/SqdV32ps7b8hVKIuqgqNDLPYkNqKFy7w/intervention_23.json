I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of family.\n\nFirst, the context: The person is 21, used to cursing a lot, but usually controls it. They were annoyed by their sister's constant questions and physical play, which escalated when she shot them with a Nerf gun. The final trigger was a Nerf bullet to the ear, leading to the outburst.\n\nNow, considering the age difference. The sister is only 7, so her behavior might be typical for a child that age. Kids often test boundaries and don't realize how their actions affect others. The author mentions they've been trying to manage their cursing, so using such a strong swear word in front of a child is a problem. It's not just about the word itself but setting a bad example. Also, the sister was clearly upset afterward, running in crying and being in shock. The mother's upset adds to the issue.\n\nThe author did apologize, which is good, but words like \"fuck off\" can have a lasting impact, especially on a child. Even if the author felt frustrated, reacting with such a strong expletive in front of the family is inappropriate. The sister is still young and might not understand the context, but the author's actions could affect her self-esteem or behavior in the future.\n\nThe situation could have been handled better. Maybe taking a break, setting boundaries without cursing, or explaining why the behavior was annoying. Instead, the outburst could be seen as a failure to manage their emotions in a mature way, especially given their age and supposed maturity as a college student.\n\nSo, even though there was provocation, the way they responded was unkind and could harm the sister. The answer is likely A, they're in the wrong.\n"
