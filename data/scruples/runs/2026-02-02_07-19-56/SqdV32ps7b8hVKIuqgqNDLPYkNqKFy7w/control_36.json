I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves them telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" after she's been annoying them during a visit. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the sister. She's 7, so her actions might be typical for a child in terms of seeking attention or not understanding boundaries. The author is 21 and curses a lot at college, but they mention trying to use it appropriately. However, the situation here is with family, especially around kids.\n\nThe key points are that the sister was annoying the author with questions and then using a Nerf gun. The author tried to tell her to stop, but after she keeps doing it, they snap and yell a curse word. The sister then cries, and the mom is upset. The author apologized, and the sister accepted it, but there's lingering effects.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, using such strong language towards a young child is problematic. Even if the author was annoyed, reacting with a curse word could be hurtful and set a bad example. Kids might not understand the full impact, but they can sense the intent. The fact that the sister ran off crying shows it affected her. Also, the mother's reaction indicates that the family values different behavior.\n\nThe author's excuse is that they were stressed and had a history of cursing, but being in front of family and a child is a different context. The immediate apology is a good step, but the action itself is questionable. The author should have found a better way to handle the frustration without using such strong language.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). They could have handled the situation without cursing, especially given the age of the sister and the family setting. Even if the sister was annoying, the response was excessive and potentially harmful.\n"
