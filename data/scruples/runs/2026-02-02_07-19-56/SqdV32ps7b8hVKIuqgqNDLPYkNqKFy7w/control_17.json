I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 21, back home for Spring Break. Their 7-year-old sister is being annoying with questions and physical play, like kickboxing and Nerf gun attacks. The author ends up yelling \"fuck off\" in front of the family, leading the sister to cry. They apologized, and the sister accepted it, but the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author admits they curse a lot in college but try to control it. This time, they lost their temper. The sister is young and likely not understanding the severity of the language. The incident happened in front of family, which adds to the social and emotional impact, especially with the mother being upset.\n\nThe main issue is the use of a strong curse word directed at a young sibling in a family setting. Even if the sister was annoying, the reaction seems disproportionate. The author's responsibility as an older sibling to model appropriate behavior is important here. The sister is 7, so her actions might be playful rather than malicious. The author's frustration built up over several days, but the actual trigger was a Nerf gun incident. However, the choice of language was harsh, especially considering the audience and the sister's age. While the author did apologize, the harm might already be done, affecting the sister's perception and the mother's disapproval.\n\nI think the consensus would be that the author is in the wrong because the reaction was inappropriate given the sister's age and the context. The author should have managed their frustration better and chosen a different response.\n"
