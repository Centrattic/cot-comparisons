I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 21, home from college for Spring Break. Their 7-year-old sister is being annoying, asking questions, and playing with Nerf guns. The author gets increasingly frustrated over a few days, leading to an outburst at the BBQ. They scream \"FUCK OFF\" after she hits them with a Nerf bullet. Then they apologize, but the sister is upset and the mom is still upset.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author did use a strong curse word at a young sibling in front of family. Even if they're feeling frustrated, the method of response seems harsh. The sister is 7, so she might not fully understand the weight of that curse word. The author acknowledges they have a problem with cursing but tried to use it in the right situations. However, this situation\u2014directed at a child in front of family\u2014probably doesn't fit the \"right situations.\" \n\nAlso, the author did apologize, which is a positive step. But the fact that the sister was in shock and the mom is upset suggests that the outburst had negative consequences. The key here is whether the response was appropriate. Even if the sister was annoying, using such a strong expletive is likely not an acceptable response, especially towards a younger sibling. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they could have handled the frustration differently. Maybe setting boundaries without cursing, or taking a break instead of lashing out. The fact that they cooled off and then lost control again shows a breakdown in managing their emotions. Also, considering the sister's age and the family context, the curse word could have been more hurtful than intended. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong. They used an inappropriate response that hurt their sister and upset their mom, despite apologizing. The key is the appropriateness of the language used in that situation.\n"
