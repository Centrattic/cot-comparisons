I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. The situation is a bit detailed. \n\nFirst, the author is 21, back from college, and dealing with a 7-year-old sister who's been annoying them with questions and physical play. The sister started doing karate and was kicking/punching them, but the author just went to their room. Then at a family BBQ, the sister used a Nerf gun, leading the author to yell \"FUCK OFF\" after she shot them again. They apologized later, and the sister is upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The key points are the use of a strong curse word directed at a young sibling in front of family. The author acknowledges they curse a lot in college but are usually careful. However, in this situation, the target is a child and the context is inappropriate. Even if the sister was annoying, reacting with such a strong expletive and causing her to cry suggests poor handling. The author did apologize, which is a good step, but the initial reaction is problematic. Parents often set standards for language, especially around children. The sister is 7, so using \"fuck off\" is not just a slip\u2014it's a harsh term that can affect the child's well-being and set a bad example. The fact that the mom is upset adds to the weight. While the author might be stressed from being back home and dealing with the sister's behavior, the response was inappropriate. So, the author is in the wrong because they escalated the situation with a strong curse word towards a young sibling in a public family setting. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
