I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old who, after multiple instances of their 7-year-old sister annoying them, ends up telling her to \"fuck off\" in front of the family. They feel bad afterward and apologized, but the sister was upset and the mom is still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author acknowledges cursing and getting annoyed over time. The sister's actions were harmless but persistent\u2014questions, karate moves, Nerf gun. The final trigger was being shot in the ear, leading to the outburst. The author apologized, and the sister accepted but was shocked.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The sister is young, and while she was being annoying, she's a kid. The author, being an adult, has more control over their reactions. Using a strong swear word like \"fuck off\" in front of family, especially with a child present, is probably inappropriate. Even if the author was stressed, the response might be excessive. The fact that they felt bad and apologized shows remorse, but the action itself could be seen as wrong because it's unkind and sets a bad example. The sister could have been hurt by the language, and the mom's upset indicates that it crossed a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister was being persistent, and the author was dealing with accumulated stress. However, adults are expected to manage their temper better. The situation might be a teachable moment about handling frustration without swearing, especially around children. The author's outburst could have long-term effects on the sister's feelings, even if she accepted the apology.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because using such language towards a younger sibling in front of the family is inappropriate, regardless of provocation. The author should have found a better way to handle the frustration without resorting to a harsh expletive.\n"
