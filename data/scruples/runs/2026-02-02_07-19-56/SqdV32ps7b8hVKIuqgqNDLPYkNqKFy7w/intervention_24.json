I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 21 and went back home for Spring Break. Their 7-year-old sister started annoying them with questions and then used a Nerf gun during a family BBQ. The person told her to \"fuck off,\" which is pretty harsh for a kid her age. \n\nFirst, the sister is young and probably just being playful, not trying to be malicious. Kids that age act out and don't understand boundaries well. The person mentions that the sister was shooting them with Nerf guns and kicking them, which could be seen as innocent play but might be over the top. However, the key here is the response. Using a strong curse word like that, especially in front of the entire family, is a big deal. \n\nThe person admits they curse a lot in college but try to control it. But in this situation, it's their family, and their sister is much younger. The reaction seems disproportionate to the actions. The sister might not even understand the severity of the words. Also, the fact that the sister ran inside crying and the mom is upset shows that the comment had a negative impact.\n\nEven though the person apologized, the initial reaction was still wrong. They had the opportunity to handle it differently, like walking away or setting boundaries without using such language. The fact that they felt bad afterward suggests they knew it wasn't the right thing to do. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person is in the wrong because their response was inappropriate and harmful, regardless of the sister's actions.\n"
