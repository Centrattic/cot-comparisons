I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old who said \"fuck off\" to his 7-year-old sister in front of the whole family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they curse a lot in college but try to control it. They got annoyed by their sister's actions over a few days\u2014Karate moves, Nerf gun incidents. The final straw was the Nerf bullet in the ear, leading to the outburst.\n\nThe sister is 7, so she's a kid. Kids often act out or be annoying, especially when they're excited or in a phase. The author tried to handle it by going to their room, but eventually lost their temper. Even though they apologized and the sister accepted it, the impact of using such a strong curse word on a child could be lasting. The mom is upset, which adds to the concern.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, using derogatory language towards a child, especially in front of others, can affect their self-esteem and how they view conflict resolution. Kids might not understand the severity but pick up on the emotion. The author's frustration is understandable, but there are better ways to handle it without resorting to swearing. \n\nAlso, considering the age gap, the sister isn't intentionally trying to provoke; she's just a kid playing. The author, being an adult, should model patience and find alternative ways to de-escalate. The fact that they felt the need to go outside and help with the BBQ shows they were trying to calm down, but the final incident pushed them over. \n\nEven though the author apologized, the initial action still stands. The question is whether the action was wrong. Since the sister is young and the language used is harsh, it's more likely the author is in the wrong. They could have addressed the situation differently without using such strong language. So, the answer would be A.\n"
