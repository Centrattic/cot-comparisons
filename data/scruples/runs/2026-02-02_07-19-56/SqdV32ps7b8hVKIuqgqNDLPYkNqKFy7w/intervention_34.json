I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 21-year-old who said \"fuck off\" to their 7-year-old sister in front of the family. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person is an adult, which gives them more responsibility in how they handle their emotions and actions. The sister is 7, so her actions, while annoying, are typical for a child. The author mentions that the sister was being annoying with questions, physical play, and Nerf gun attacks. However, the key point here is the use of a strong expletive towards a young child in front of the family.\n\nEven if the author was annoyed, reacting with a curse word that's so harsh might not be appropriate, especially towards a younger sibling. The author acknowledges that they can have a problem with cursing and usually try to control it. The sister running away crying and the mother being upset suggests that the reaction was indeed hurtful.\n\nWhile the author did apologize and the sister accepted it, the initial reaction might still be considered inconsiderate. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. The fact that they used such a strong word in a moment of frustration towards a child could be seen as inappropriate. The context includes repeated annoyances, but the response was a direct and harsh verbal reprimand that could have lasting effects on a child. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author likely is in the wrong for using that language. The answer is A.\n"
