I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling \"fuck off\" at their 7-year-old sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is 21, away at college, comes home for a break. The sister is 7, so quite young. The author mentions that they curse a lot in college but usually control it. The situation builds up over a few days with the sister annoying them with questions, karate moves, and then Nerf gun attacks. The final trigger is a Nerf shot to the ear, leading to the outburst.\n\nNow, I need to consider the age difference and the appropriateness of the response. A 7-year-old's behavior, while annoying, is typical for that age. The author's reaction with a strong swear word is significant because it's directed at a child and in front of family. Even if the author was frustrated, using such language towards a sibling, especially a younger one, can be harmful. It's important to model respectful communication, especially for kids learning how to interact.\n\nAlso, the author did apologize, which shows they recognize the mistake. However, the fact that the sister was upset and the mother is upset indicates that the outburst had negative consequences. The author might have lost their temper, but the response was disproportionate given the sister's age and the nature of her actions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have handled the situation differently, like calmly setting boundaries without using offensive language. The sister being in a phase might explain her behavior, but that doesn't justify the author's response. The key point is the use of a swear word in a context where it could hurt the child and set a bad example.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
