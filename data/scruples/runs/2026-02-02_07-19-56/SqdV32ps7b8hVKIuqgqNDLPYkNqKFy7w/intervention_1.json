I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the 21-year-old brother telling his 7-year-old sister to \"fuck off\" in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference and the context. The sister is 7 and is doing things like asking questions, playing with Karate moves, and using a Nerf gun. The brother is annoyed and eventually snaps. The key here is whether the reaction is proportionate to the behavior. \n\nThe brother mentions he curses a lot in college but tries to control it. However, in front of family, especially with a young child, using such a strong expletive seems harsh. The sister is still a child, and even though she's being annoying, responding with a swear word to her face might be considered inappropriate. \n\nThe brother did apologize and the sister accepted it, but the mom is upset. The mother's reaction suggests that the family might have higher expectations for respectful communication, especially between siblings. Also, the brother's own admission that he feels bad about it implies he recognizes something was wrong.\n\nEven if the sister was being persistent, there are more appropriate ways to handle frustration without resorting to profanity in front of a young child. The brother could have set boundaries, removed himself from the situation earlier, or communicated his need for space without using an expletive. \n\nConsidering the impact on the sister, who is still developing her emotional understanding, being told to \"fuck off\" by an older sibling in front of the family could be hurtful and confusing. The mother's upset reaction also highlights the family's norms around language and respect. \n\nSo, the brother's actions, while perhaps a momentary loss of temper, crossed a line in terms of appropriate communication, especially given the age difference and the audience. He is in the wrong here.\n"
