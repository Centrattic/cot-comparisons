I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 21, getting annoyed with their 7-year-old sister during a family gathering and yelling \"fuck off\" at her. The sister then runs off crying, and the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they curse a lot in college but usually control it. However, here they lost their temper after multiple incidents with their sister: the sister was annoying them with questions, doing karate moves, using a Nerf gun, and finally shot them in the ear, leading to the outburst. \n\nThe key points here are the age difference and the appropriateness of the language. A 7-year-old is young and likely doesn't understand the full weight of a curse word, but using such strong language in front of family could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the sister was annoying the author, reacting with a swear word might escalate the situation and set a bad example. \n\nThe author did apologize, and the sister accepted it, but the emotional impact on the child and the mother is there. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after a long time away from home and dealing with a younger sibling's behavior. However, the use of \"fuck off\" is a strong reaction, especially when dealing with a child. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have handled the situation differently, like calmly telling the sister to stop without using a swear word. The fact that the sister was in a phase and the author was dealing with accumulated stress might mitigate some blame, but the choice of words is still a problem. \n\nConsidering all this, the consensus in AITA threads often leans towards being strict about respecting others, especially children. So the author is likely in the wrong for using that language, even if provoked. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
