I\u2019m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I\u2019m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn\u2019t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything\u2019s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I\u2019m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I\u2019ve been doing it for years). At this point I\u2019m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything\u2019s going well again and I\u2019m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I\u2019ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she\u2019s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person, who's 21, came back home for Spring Break and was annoyed by their 7-year-old sister. They ended up yelling \"fuck off\" in front of the family after the sister kept bothering them with questions, karate moves, and a Nerf gun. The person apologized, but the sister was upset, and the mom is still upset.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points here are the age difference, the situation, and the response. The sister is 7, so she's a child. Kids that age don't understand the severity of adult language, and they can't control their actions in the same way. The author was dealing with a series of annoyances, but using such a strong swear word in front of the family, especially directed at a child, seems harsh. \n\nEven though the author might have had a bad day and was annoyed, the reaction of yelling a curse word at a sibling in front of others is problematic. The author acknowledges that they curse a lot but try to control it, so this was an overreaction. The sister didn't mean to do anything malicious; she's just a kid being playful. The author's frustration built up over time, but the choice of words and the public nature of the outburst likely hurt the sister and upset the parents. \n\nAlso, the fact that the sister was in shock and ran crying shows that the impact was significant. The author did apologize, which is good, but the action itself was inappropriate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think yes, because the response was excessive and unkind, even if they felt provoked. So the answer should be A.\n"
