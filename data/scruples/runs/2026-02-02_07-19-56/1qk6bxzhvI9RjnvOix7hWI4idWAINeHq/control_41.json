I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody issue between an ex couple in California. The author, now in NYC, wanted to bring the dog there, but the ex refused. The author ended up flying to California and taking the dog without the ex's knowledge, leading to their current conflict.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the author says they legally own the dog on paper and have been responsible for her care. They had a verbal agreement. But in California, joint custody might mean both have rights. Even if the author is the legal owner, joint custody could require some mutual agreement. Taking the dog without the ex's consent, even if they were being unreasonable, might be a legal problem. Stealing, even one's own pet, could lead to charges like animal theft or interference with custody.\n\nThen, the ethical side. The author felt forced into a corner because the ex wasn't compromising. Friends said the ex was manipulating. The author's decision to take the dog secretly might be seen as desperate, but is it justified? If there's a legal dispute, the court would consider the best interest of the dog. The ex's argument about the dog's quality of life in NYC vs. California might have some merit, but the author might counter that the ex is just being controlling.\n\nBut the key here is that the author acted without following legal procedures. Even if they believe they were in the right, taking the dog without a court order could be seen as unlawful. The ex could potentially file for custody in court, and the author's actions might hurt their case. Courts usually prefer resolution through legal means, not personal action.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the author feels they had no choice, but the ex is upset. The situation is messy, and the author might face legal consequences. So, while the ex's behavior could be questionable, the author's method of resolving it might be legally problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't go through the proper legal channels, even if they felt justified."
