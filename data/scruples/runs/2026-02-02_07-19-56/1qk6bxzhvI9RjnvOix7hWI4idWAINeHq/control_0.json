I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for taking their dog back from their ex without permission. They had joint custody in California, and the dog is legally theirs. They moved to NYC and had an agreement for the dog to come, but the ex refused. The author then flew out and took the dog, thinking the ex was manipulating them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The dog is legally the author's, so they have ownership on paper. However, joint custody might mean they both had agreed terms. The ex might have a claim if they have any legal rights from the custody agreement. But since the author owns the dog, maybe the ex was just in possession. \n\nThen there's the method of taking the dog. The author took her without informing the ex, which could be seen as theft, even if it's their own dog. The ex might have had possession under the custody agreement, so taking the dog without notice could violate that agreement. The author might be liable for contempt of court if there was a custody order. \n\nEmotionally, the author felt trapped and manipulated, which is understandable after a breakup. But using force (even if it's just taking the dog) could escalate the situation. The ex could retaliate legally or otherwise. The author's friends thought the ex was controlling, which might be true, but that doesn't justify illegal actions.\n\nIn legal terms, taking property (the dog) without a court order could be problematic. Even if the author owns the dog, the ex might have had temporary possession rights. The author should have gone through legal channels, like filing a motion for exclusive custody or seeking court enforcement. \n\nSo, while the author might have a point about their legal ownership, the method of taking the dog without following legal procedures might make them at fault. They could be seen as acting outside the law, even if their intentions were good. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not following proper legal steps and potentially violating the custody agreement.\n"
