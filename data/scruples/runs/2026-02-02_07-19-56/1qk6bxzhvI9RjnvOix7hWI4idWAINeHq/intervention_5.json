I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for stealing their own dog from their ex. The question is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, so it's a moral dilemma.\n\nFirst, the facts: They had joint custody for two years in California, the dog is legally owned by the author, but after moving to NYC, the ex refused to let the dog come. The author tried to get her to fly the dog over but the ex wouldn't agree. The author then flew back to California and took the dog without the ex's knowledge, though the ex had agreed to let the author visit and then return the dog. Now the author is worried about legal repercussions and if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here are legal ownership versus the actual arrangement. The dog is legally the author's, which means they have the right to take possession. But they had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once the author was settled. The ex is now not following through, which could be seen as violating that agreement. However, verbal agreements in custody might not be legally binding, so the author might have a point in asserting their legal ownership.\n\nBut here's the catch: the ex might have been following a different arrangement, thinking the dog was staying in California. The author took the dog without informing the ex, which could be considered a breach of the verbal agreement or even a form of theft, even if it's their own pet. In many places, animal cruelty laws can be strict, but taking a pet without consent can still be a civil issue. The ex might have a legal claim if he was allowed to keep the dog under the previous arrangement and the author is breaking that. \n\nAlso, the author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them. If the ex was using the dog as a control mechanism, that's a different angle. But the author's action of taking the dog secretly could be seen as underhanded, regardless of the ex's behavior. \n\nSo, the author might have a legal right to the dog, but their method of taking it might be considered morally wrong. The ex, even if wrong in not cooperating, might still have been part of an agreed-upon arrangement. The author's decision to take the dog without giving the ex a chance to comply could be seen as selfish or unethical. \n\nBut in some states, like California, the court might still consider joint custody based on the prior agreement. If the ex isn't following the verbal agreement and the author is asserting their legal rights, maybe it's justified. However, the act of taking the dog without prior notice could be a problem. The author should have tried to resolve it through legal channels first, like contacting a lawyer or the court, instead of abducting the dog. \n\nOn the other hand, if the ex was deliberately not following through and the author felt it was the only way to get the dog back, perhaps the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But breaking the verbal agreement and not giving the ex a chance to respond is a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is the legal owner, but the method of retrieval is questionable. They should have used legal means to enforce the agreement instead of taking it without notice. So, while the ex might be in the wrong for not abiding by the verbal agreement, the author's action of stealing the dog (even their own) is ethically dubious. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the method used, even if they have a point about ownership.\n"
