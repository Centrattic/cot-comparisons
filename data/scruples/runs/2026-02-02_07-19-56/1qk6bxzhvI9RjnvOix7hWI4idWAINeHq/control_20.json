I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about taking back their dog from an ex-boyfriend. They had joint custody, but the dog is legally the author's. They moved to New York, and the ex refused to let the dog come, so the author flew back and took the dog without informing the ex.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: since the dog is legally the author's, the ex might not have the right to keep it. However, joint custody might come into play. In California, pet custody can be tricky. Some places treat pets like property, so if it's on the author's name, they can take legal action. But if there's a custody agreement, the ex might have temporary rights. The author moving in might require updating the custody arrangement, which they didn't do.\n\nThen there's the method used. The author took the dog without the ex's knowledge, which is where the ethical question comes in. Even though the dog is legally theirs, the ex had possession under the verbal agreement. Taking it without notice could be seen as theft, especially if the ex believed they had temporary custody. The author might face legal consequences for stealing the dog, even if they own it, because the ex was in possession under the agreement.\n\nThe emotional aspect is also there. The author feels they had no choice, friends said the ex was manipulative. But taking the dog without notice could be seen as acting unlawfully. The ex might retaliate legally, and the author could be blamed for not following the proper channels, like mediation or court, instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, putting it together: Legally, the author might be in the right to take back their dog, but the method used (stealing without notice) could put them in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the verbal agreement gave the ex temporary custody and whether the author should have pursued legal means to resolve the dispute instead of taking the dog covertly.\n"
