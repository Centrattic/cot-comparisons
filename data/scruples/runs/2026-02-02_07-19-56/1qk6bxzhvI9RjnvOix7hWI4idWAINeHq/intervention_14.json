I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that they have legal ownership of the dog, which is important. They had a verbal agreement for the dog to move to NYC once they settled, but the ex refused. The author decided to fly to California and take the dog without the ex's knowledge, leading to the ex's anger and potential legal issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are: joint custody, legal ownership, verbal agreement, and the author taking the dog without consent. Even though the author owns the dog legally, the method they used to retrieve it was without the ex's knowledge. That's a problem because even if they have legal rights, taking the dog without proper legal procedures could be seen as a violation of the custody agreement they had. \n\nVerbal agreements can be tricky in legal terms. Even if they had a verbal arrangement, the ex might argue that the custody terms were part of that agreement. The author could be breaching that agreement by taking the dog unilaterally. Additionally, the author's friends suggested the ex was manipulative, but that doesn't negate the fact that the author acted outside of any legal process. \n\nThe author might have had a valid concern about the dog's well-being, but stealing the dog isn't the right approach. The better course of action would be to go to court to resolve the custody issue, especially since there's a verbal agreement that might not hold up without legal documentation. \n\nSo, even though the author has legal ownership, the method they used to retrieve the dog is problematic. They should have pursued legal avenues instead of taking matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
