I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after stealing their dog from their ex.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had joint custody of a dog in California. The author legally owns the dog and moved to NYC. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would move with them once settled. The ex refused to comply, leading the author to fly back and take the dog without the ex's full knowledge, even though the ex initially handed the dog over thinking the author would return it. Now the author is worried about legal repercussions.\n\nSo, the key points here are legal ownership and the method used to retrieve the dog. The author mentions the dog is legally theirs on paper. However, joint custody was established, which typically means both parties have rights. Even if the author owns the dog, joint custody might require some form of agreement or legal process for transferring custody, especially after a breakup. \n\nThe author's action involved deception. They took the dog while the ex believed it was just a visit, and then didn't return it. Even if the ex might be manipulating, stealing the dog without legal recourse isn't advisable. The ex could potentially take legal action, arguing that the joint custody agreement was violated. \n\nAlso, in California, the laws regarding pet custody can be tricky. While the author is the legal owner, joint custody arrangements often need to be handled through the court system if there's a dispute. Taking matters into one's own hands by \"stealing\" the pet might lead to charges like theft, especially if the ex can prove that they had joint custody rights.\n\nThe author might have a legal claim, but the method used could backfire. They might need to go to court to resolve this properly. Their actions, while motivated by concern for the dog's well-being, were likely illegal. So, the author is in the wrong because they breached the agreement and possibly violated the law in the process, even if they had legal ownership.\n"
