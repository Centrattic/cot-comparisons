I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog custody dispute after a breakup. The ex and the author had a joint custody arrangement for two years in California. The author owns the dog legally and paid for all her vaccinations. After moving to NYC, they had a verbal agreement that the dog would move there once the author was settled, but the ex changed his mind, claiming the dog would be better off in California. The author tried to argue but eventually gave in, realized the ex was manipulating, and then flew to California to take the dog without the ex's knowledge, lying about being just a visitor. The author then sent an email and didn't answer the ex's calls.\n\nSo, the key points here are the legal ownership and the actions taken. Legally, the dog is the author's, so they might have the right to reclaim it. However, the method used could be problematic. They had a verbal agreement, which might not be legally binding, but they broke it. The ex might have a case if they argue the author didn't follow the agreed terms. Also, the author took the dog under false pretenses, which could be seen as deceptive. While the intent was to prevent the dog from being in a bad environment, taking the dog without the ex's knowledge could lead to legal issues, like theft even if it's their own pet. The ex might try to sue for damages or something. So, even if the author is right in ownership, the way they took the dog could be wrong. They should have maybe gone through legal channels or mediation instead of acting unilaterally. So, I think the author is in the wrong because they stole the dog, even if it was from their ex. The correct answer is A.\n"
