I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves joint custody of a dog, a breakup, moving across the country, and the author taking the dog without the ex's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The author mentions that they legally own the dog on paper and have joint custody. In California, when pets are involved, courts often consider the best interest of the animal, but joint custody agreements can be tricky. The author and ex had a verbal agreement, which might not hold up in court if there's a dispute. Since the author is the legal owner, they have more standing, but the ex had custody as part of their arrangement.\n\nThe author moved to NYC and had planned for the dog to join them. The ex refused to comply with their verbal agreement. The author tried to negotiate but felt manipulated. In frustration, they flew to California and took the dog without telling the ex, who had agreed to let them visit but not take her. \n\nLegally, taking the dog without consent could be seen as theft, even if it's the legal owner's pet. The ex might have a claim under the joint custody agreement. The author's actions could be considered a breach of the custody agreement, even if they own the dog. Also, taking the dog without notice might have caused distress to the ex, which could be a factor in any legal case.\n\nEthically, the author's intent was to get their dog back, which is understandable. However, using deceptive means (making the ex think it was a visit) is questionable. The author might have had the right to take the dog if there was a legal right, but the method used could be problematic. If the ex had legal custody rights as part of the joint arrangement, the author might have needed to go through legal channels instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThe ex might retaliate legally, especially if they have documentation of the verbal agreement or can argue neglect in NYC. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them, which could be true, but that doesn't excuse breaking the custody agreement. The author has the legal ownership but might not have the legal right to take the dog unilaterally if the custody was agreed upon.\n\nSo, the answer is a mix of legal and ethical considerations. Legally, the author might be at fault for not following the custody agreement and taking the dog without notice. Ethically, the desperation and belief that they were doing the right thing by the dog complicates it. But overall, the author's actions crossed a line by deceiving the ex and potentially breaching the custody terms. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
