I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong when they flew to California to take back their dog from their ex. The author mentions they have legal ownership of the dog in California, and there was a verbal agreement for the dog to move with them to NYC once settled. The ex refused, leading the author to take the dog without prior agreement.\n\nFirst, legal ownership is a key point. Since the dog is legally the author's, they might have the right to have the dog back. However, they had a joint custody arrangement. But when the author moved to NYC, the ex refused to let the dog come, breaking the verbal agreement. The author tried to reason with the ex but was met with resistance. Friends thought the ex was manipulating, leading the author to take matters into their own hands.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the author owns the dog, they can take steps to regain possession. However, the ex might have a claim if there was a custody agreement in place. The author's approach was to take the dog without prior communication, which might be seen as a breach of the custody arrangement. But since the ex refused to comply with the verbal agreement, the author might argue necessity.\n\nHowever, using deception (telling the ex they were just visiting) to take the dog could be problematic. The ex might argue that the author violated their custody rights. Even if the author is the legal owner, the method of taking the dog might have been inappropriate. Courts usually prefer legal processes over self-help. The author might be at risk of facing legal consequences if the ex sues.\n\nAlso, the ex's concerns about the dog's quality of life in NYC might be genuine, but that doesn't negate the author's legal rights. The ex could have taken legal action to modify custody if they had valid reasons. The author's actions, while driven by legal ownership, could be seen as overstepping if done without legal recourse. So, the author might be in the wrong for not seeking legal intervention first, even though their ownership is valid.\n"
