I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a dog custody issue between an ex couple. The author moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come with them. The ex refused, and the author decided to fly back, take the dog without telling the ex, and left them in the dark. The author now feels guilty but justifies it because the dog is legally theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if taking the dog without the ex's consent is legally and ethically wrong. The dog is legally owned by the author, so they have the right to their property. However, they had a joint custody arrangement. Even though it's their property, the ex was caring for the dog under the agreement. The author took the dog without informing the ex, which might be seen as a violation of their agreed-upon arrangement, even if it's a verbal one.\n\nBut in California, joint custody agreements for pets can be tricky. If the ex was part of the care and the arrangement was mutual, then taking the dog without notice might disrupt that. The author's actions could be seen as deceptive, as they led the ex to believe they were just visiting, which might be considered misleading. The ex might argue breach of the custody agreement or even theft, depending on the courts' interpretation.\n\nLegally, the author might be in the right because the dog is their property. But ethically, the method of taking the dog without communication could be questionable. The ex might feel disrespected, and the author's friends thought the ex was manipulating, but that's their perception. The author's actions could lead to legal trouble if the ex takes them to court, as the ex might claim breach of the custody agreement or some form of interference.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the verbal agreement was part of the joint custody, then not following through without notice could be problematic. But since the dog is their legal property, they might have a stronger legal standing. However, the way they took the dog might not be the best approach. The answer might be a mix of legal rights and ethical considerations. The key points are the legal ownership versus the joint custody arrangement and the method of retrieval.\n"
