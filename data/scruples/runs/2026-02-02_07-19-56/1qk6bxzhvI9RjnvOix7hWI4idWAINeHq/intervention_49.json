I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for stealing their own dog from their ex boyfriend in California. The situation involves joint custody, legal ownership, and the ex not allowing the dog to move to NYC. The author moved there and had a verbal agreement, then decided to take the dog without the ex's knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author says they own the dog legally on paper and have paid for all vaccinations. But they had a joint custody arrangement. Even though the dog is their legal property, joint custody might imply shared responsibility and agreement on major decisions. Taking the dog without informing the ex, even if it's your property, could be a problem because joint custody likely requires both parties to consent to moving the dog across state lines.\n\nIn California, the laws regarding pet custody can vary. Some states treat pets as property, so the owner can take their pet, but if there's a custody agreement, it might be more complex. The ex might have a legal right to have the dog in their care as per the custody arrangement. The author's action of taking the dog without prior agreement could be seen as a violation of that arrangement, even if they own the dog.\n\nAlso, the ex might have a claim if the author didn't follow the agreed-upon custody terms. The verbal agreement was that the dog would come to NYC once the author was settled, but the ex changed their mind. If the author had gone to court to modify the custody arrangement instead of taking matters into their own hands, that would have been the proper legal path. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The author feels bad about separating the dog from the ex's other dog and the environment. The ex might have felt that the dog's well-being would be compromised in NYC, so the author's actions could be seen as disregarding that. However, the ex's refusal to compromise without considering the author's situation might also be an issue. \n\nBut legally, without a court order, taking the dog without the other party's consent in a joint custody situation could lead to legal consequences. The author might be at risk of being charged with some form of theft or violating custody terms. The ex could potentially take them to court as mentioned. \n\nSo, even though the dog is legally the author's, the joint custody agreement may require mutual consent for relocations. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow the appropriate legal channels to resolve the custody dispute, leading to a possible breach of the agreement.\n"
