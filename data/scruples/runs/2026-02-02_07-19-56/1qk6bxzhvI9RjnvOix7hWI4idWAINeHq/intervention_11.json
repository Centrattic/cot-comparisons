I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody issue after a breakup. The author and their ex have joint custody, but the author legally owns the dog. They moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come there once settled. But the ex refused, saying the dog would be better in California. The author tried to reason but eventually decided to fly to California and take the dog without the ex's knowledge, pretending they were just visiting. The ex allowed the author to take the dog under the false premise that they'd return her.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect is important. The author says they own the dog on paper, so legally they have ownership. But joint custody might mean there's some agreement in place. If they had a verbal agreement to split time, but the ex is now refusing, maybe there's a breach of that agreement. However, the author taking the dog without the ex's consent could be problematic. Even if they have legal ownership, taking the dog without notice might lead to legal issues, especially if the ex has custody rights. Also, the author's actions might be seen as deceptive because they tricked the ex into giving the dog to them under false pretenses. That could be a breach of trust and possibly illegal, depending on the custody arrangement.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical part. The author is prioritizing their legal right over the ex's feelings and the dog's supposed well-being as per the ex's argument. But maybe the ex is also being controlling. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them. However, the act of stealing the dog, even if it's their own, might be considered wrong because it's a violation of the custody agreement and could escalate the conflict. The author now faces potential legal action from the ex.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they took the dog through deception and without respecting the agreed-upon custody arrangement, even if they have legal ownership. The situation is complicated, but the method of taking the dog was underhanded and might not be legally justified. So, the answer is probably A.\n"
