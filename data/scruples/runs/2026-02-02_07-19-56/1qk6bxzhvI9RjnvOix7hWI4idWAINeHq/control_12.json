I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took their dog from the ex-boyfriend without consent is in the wrong. The situation involves joint custody, legal ownership, and some conflict after moving to a new state.\n\nFirst, the dog is legally owned by the author, so they have a right to possession. The ex had joint custody, which in some states might mean shared responsibility, but since the author is the sole legal owner, the ex's rights might be more about visitation rather than ownership. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they're not legally binding, but the ex agreed to let the dog move to NYC once the author was settled. Now the ex is not following through, possibly breaching the agreement.\n\nThe author took the dog without the ex's knowledge, which is a problem. Even if the ex was being manipulative, stealing the dog could be seen as a crime, like theft or unauthorized taking of property. The ex might have a legal claim if the custody agreement wasn't formalized, especially in California where family courts might handle pet custody differently. \n\nBut the author's main argument is legal ownership. If there's a court order or legal document stating they own the dog, that's a strong point. However, joint custody arrangements might require both parties to agree on the dog's location. The ex might have a valid concern about the dog's well-being in NYC, but that doesn't necessarily override the legal ownership. \n\nThe author's actions could lead to legal consequences because they didn't follow proper channels. Even if they feel wronged, taking the dog without consent and not communicating properly might be considered illegal. The ex could argue that the verbal agreement was in place, and the author breaking it by trying to take the dog might have been a breach. \n\nSo, while the author might have a legal basis for ownership, the method of taking the dog without consent is problematic. The right approach would be to go through the legal system to determine custody, especially after a move. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the manner in which they took the dog, even if the ex was being unreasonable.\n"
