I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for stealing their own dog from their ex in California after a breakup. They had joint custody, but the dog is legally theirs. They moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come with them once settled. But the ex refused to let the dog move, saying it's better for her to stay in California with a backyard and another dog. The person tried to argue but eventually gave in, but their friends said the ex was manipulating them. They decided to fly to California and take the dog without the ex's knowledge. The ex handed the dog over thinking they were just visiting, but then the person left without returning her.\n\nFirst, the legal ownership is key here. The dog is legally theirs, so maybe that's a point in their favor. But joint custody might be a factor. In some places, even if you own the pet, custody can be negotiated like child custody. But the ex was under the impression that the dog was staying with him. The person broke the verbal agreement by not following through, so maybe that's where the issue is. Also, taking the dog without informing the ex could be seen as theft, especially if the ex had a legal right to shared custody. The person might be right in believing the ex was being controlling, but using force or deception to take the dog back could make the situation worse. The ex might retaliate legally. So even though the dog is theirs, the way they took it might be problematic. Maybe the author is in the wrong for breaking the agreement and stealing the dog.\n"
