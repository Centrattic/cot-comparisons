I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stealing their own dog from their ex-boyfriend. The situation involves joint custody after a breakup, with the dog legally owned by the author. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once the author was settled, but the ex changed his mind and didn't let the dog come. The author then went to California to take the dog back without the ex's knowledge, and now the ex might take them to court.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions that the dog is legally theirs on paper. In California, pet custody laws can be tricky, but generally, if one person is the legal owner, the other may need a court order to have the pet. However, just because they had joint custody doesn't necessarily mean the ex can just keep the dog. The verbal agreement might not hold up legally, but the fact that the author is the legal owner could matter.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The ex might argue that the dog's well-being is a priority, especially if the living conditions in NYC are not ideal. The author's friends think the ex is manipulating, but maybe the ex is genuinely concerned. Taking the dog without consent could be seen as a theft, even if it's your own pet. The author might be in a legal gray area here.\n\nAlso, the author gave in to the ex's demands, which their friends said was manipulation. Then they decided to take the dog back when they realized the ex was being controlling. The author's actions might be seen as self-preservation, but using deception to get the dog back could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of the law, stealing your own pet could lead to charges of theft, even if you're the owner, depending on the circumstances. If the ex had possession as part of an agreement, taking the dog without notice might be illegal. However, if the ex was not following a court order or if the agreement was verbal and not enforceable, the author might have a stronger legal claim.\n\nThe author sent an email when they arrived at the airport and ignored calls. The ex might have a right to be upset, especially if the dog was in his care. The emotional aspect is that the author feels they had no choice, but they also caused the ex stress and potential harm to the dog's routine.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a complicated situation. Legally, they might be right if the ex was in violation of their previous agreement, but the method of retrieval (without consent and possibly using deception) could be seen as wrong. Ethically, it's about balancing ownership rights with the other person's reasonable concerns. The answer could be A, as taking the dog without consent might still be against the law, even if the author is the owner, and it could lead to legal issues despite their intentions.\n"
