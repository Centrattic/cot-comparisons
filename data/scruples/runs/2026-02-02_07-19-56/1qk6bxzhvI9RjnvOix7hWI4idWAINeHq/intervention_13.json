I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog custody dispute after a breakup. The key points here are the legal ownership and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that they legally own the dog and have paid for all her vaccinations. They had a verbal agreement with their ex about the dog moving to NYC once settled. The ex then changed their mind, and the user took the dog without the ex's consent, even though there was a verbal agreement and legal ownership on their side.\n\nNow, in legal terms, verbal agreements can be tricky. While the user is the legal owner, the ex might have rights under joint custody, especially if there was a formal agreement. But since the user is the legal owner, they might have the right to take the dog back. However, doing so without the ex's consent and through deception (like pretending to just visit) could complicate things. \n\nThe user's actions might be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which isn't advisable. Even if they believe the dog is their legal property, abducting the dog without following proper legal channels could lead to legal repercussions. The ex could potentially sue for damages or seek a court order, which might not go in the user's favor if they didn't follow the correct procedures.\n\nAdditionally, the user's friends suggested the ex was manipulating them, but that doesn't justify the actions. The ethical aspect is a bit muddled. The user felt they had no choice, but there might have been better ways to handle it, like consulting a lawyer before taking the dog. The emotional impact on the dog is also a factor, but the user's primary concern was legal ownership.\n\nIn summary, while the user has a legal claim, their method of retrieving the dog could be problematic. The answer leans towards the user being in the wrong because they didn't pursue legal avenues and acted without consent, which might lead to further legal issues.\n"
