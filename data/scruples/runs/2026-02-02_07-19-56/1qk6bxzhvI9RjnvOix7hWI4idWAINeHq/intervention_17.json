I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The story is about a dog custody issue after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the context: They were in a joint custody agreement for two years. The author legally owns the dog and paid for vaccinations. They took turns every two weeks. Then, the author moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come there once settled. But the ex refused, saying the dog would be better off in CA with a backyard and another dog. The author tried to argue but the ex wouldn't compromise. Friends thought the ex was manipulating, so the author flew to CA to take the dog without telling him, only informing via email after. The ex called multiple times, but the author didn't answer. Now the author is worried about being taken to court.\n\nHmm. Legally, the author owns the dog, so they might have a right to take her. But the joint custody implies an agreement. The ex might have a claim if the agreement wasn't formalized. The verbal agreement could be a point. The author might be breaching that by taking the dog without discussion. But since the ex changed the agreement after moving out, maybe the author felt cornered.\n\nEthically, though. Taking the dog without consent, even if legal, could be seen as wrong. The ex had a relationship with the dog, and the sudden removal might cause distress. Also, the ex might have a legal argument if there's a custody arrangement in place, even if verbal. In some states, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but if the author is the sole legal owner, maybe they can do it.\n\nBut the ex isn't the legal owner. The author has the title. So maybe the author is justified. But the way they did it\u2014without notice, not allowing the ex to say goodbye, etc.\u2014could be seen as harsh. The ex might not have expected that, leading to emotional harm.\n\nAlso, the author's friends said the ex was manipulative. If the ex was holding the dog hostage, the author might have felt forced. However, the author's action could be considered self-help, which is a legal concept but might not be the best approach.\n\nIn California, if they had a verbal agreement for joint custody, maybe the ex is supposed to return the dog when the time comes. If the ex is refusing, the author could have taken legal steps instead of acting unilaterally. But the author might not have time or resources for court, hence the direct action.\n\nThe key points are legal ownership vs. custody. The author owns the dog, so taking it back might be legally okay. However, the method of taking it without notice, even if justified, could be ethically questionable. The ex might have a right to some time with the dog, and the author's action could be seen as violating that, even if not the legal owner.\n\nBut since the author is the legal owner, maybe they can just take the dog, especially if the ex isn't following the original agreement. The problem is whether the ex had a right to the dog during the time between moving to NYC and the next custody switch. If the verbal agreement was that the dog would come once settled, and the ex is preventing that, the author might be within their rights. However, the sudden flight and taking the dog without communication could be seen as extreme, even if justified.\n\nAlso, the ex handed the dog over but thought it was just a visit. The author tricked them into thinking it was temporary. That deception might be a point against the author. So, even if the author believes they're in the right, the method involved deceit. \n\nIn court, the ex might argue that the joint custody was a mutual agreement, and the author taking the dog without giving him a chance could be seen as violating that. But if the ex is the one breaking the verbal agreement, the author might have a case. However, the author's actions could be deemed as harassment or something else if the ex sues for wrongful taking.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the verbal agreement is enforceable and if the author followed proper procedures. Since the author is the legal owner, maybe they're not in the wrong legally, but ethically, the deception and lack of communication could make them the asshole.\n"
