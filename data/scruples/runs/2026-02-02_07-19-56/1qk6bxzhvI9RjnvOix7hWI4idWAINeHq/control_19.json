I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog custody dispute between an ex-boyfriend and the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that the dog is legally their property in California. They had a verbal agreement for the dog to move to NYC once the author was settled. But the ex changed his mind, leading the author to fly back and take the dog without informing him. The ex handed the dog over thinking it was a visit, but the author didn't return her.\n\nIn California, joint custody arrangements for pets can exist, but the legal ownership is key here. If the author is the legal owner, they might have more rights. However, verbal agreements might not hold up in court. The author's actions of taking the dog without clear communication could be seen as theft, even if it's their own pet. The ex might have a case if he can show that the custody arrangement was mutual, even if verbal.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author felt manipulated and wanted the best for the dog, but taking the dog without consent could cause legal and emotional issues. The ex might feel wronged, especially if he believed the arrangement changed. The author's friends thought the ex was controlling, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions.\n\nThe key points are legal ownership versus custody arrangements. If the author's name is on the dog's papers, they might have a stronger legal claim. However, the ex might argue that the verbal agreement was part of the custody arrangement. Taking the dog without notice could lead to legal repercussions, even if the author believes they're right.\n\nSo, while the author might feel they had no choice, the act of taking the dog without the ex's consent, especially if there's a custody agreement in place, could be considered wrong. The legal system typically requires adherence to agreements, even verbal ones, so the author's actions might be seen as violating that agreement, leading to them being in the wrong.\n"
