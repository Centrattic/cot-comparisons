I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody dispute between an ex-boyfriend and the author. They had joint custody for two years, but the author legally owns the dog. After moving to NYC, the author tried to bring the dog but the ex refused. The author then flew to California to take the dog back without telling the ex, leading to the ex's anger and possible legal action.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have legal ownership on paper. That's important because legally, the dog is their property. However, joint custody agreements usually require both parties to cooperate. The ex was allowed to have the dog every two weeks, and they had a verbal agreement for the dog to move to NYC once the author was settled. The ex then reneged on that agreement, leading the author to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe author's action of taking the dog without informing the ex could be seen as a breach of the verbal agreement or even a potential violation of the custody terms. Even though the dog is legally the author's, custody arrangements often involve shared responsibilities. By taking the dog without consent, the author might be violating the terms of their joint custody, which could lead to legal issues. The ex might argue that the author isn't following the agreed-upon custody schedule and is interfering with his time with the dog.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to not answering the ex's calls after taking the dog, which could be seen as escalating the conflict rather than resolving it. The ex might use this as evidence of bad faith or an attempt to avoid communication, which courts typically look negatively upon in custody disputes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt manipulated and controlled by the ex, which could be a legitimate concern. If the ex was indeed being unreasonable and refusing to compromise, the author might feel they had no choice. But legally, taking the dog without following the proper channels (like court) could still be problematic. The author might need to go through legal means to enforce their custody rights instead of taking the dog themselves.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be to protect their legal ownership and the dog's well-being, the method of taking the dog without proper legal process could put them in the wrong. Courts usually require cooperative resolution and following legal procedures. The author might be at risk of facing legal consequences if the ex takes them to court, which means they could be in the wrong despite their justification.\n"
