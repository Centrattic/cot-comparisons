I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their ex-boyfriend had joint custody of a dog for two years. The author legally owns the dog and paid for all her vaccinations. They used to take turns every two weeks. Then the author moved to NYC and they had a verbal agreement that the dog would come once the author was settled. But once they were ready, the ex said the dog wouldn't move to NYC, claiming it's better for her to stay in California because she has a backyard and another dog. The author tried to argue but couldn't get through, so they flew out to take the dog without the ex knowing, and the ex gave her up thinking it was a visit. The author hasn't answered the ex's calls since and is worried about being taken to court.\n\nFirst, the author has legal ownership of the dog. In California, pet custody laws can vary, but generally, if one person owns the pet, the other may not have a legal claim unless there's a court order. However, since they had a joint custody arrangement, maybe there was a previous agreement. The author moved to NYC, and the ex changed the terms of the custody without a court order. The author tried to argue but couldn't compromise. \n\nBut taking the dog without the ex's knowledge might be a problem. Even if the author has legal ownership, if the ex had agreed to joint custody, taking the dog without the ex's consent could be seen as violating the custody agreement. The ex might have a claim that the original arrangement was for joint custody, and the author's unilateral action could be considered wrongful. However, the author might argue that the ex was being unreasonable and that the dog's well-being is better in NYC. \n\nThe key points are: legal ownership versus custody agreement. The author might have the right to take the dog if the ex is violating the custody terms, but if the ex had a legal right to possession under the joint custody arrangement, then taking the dog without going through the proper legal channels could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the method of taking the dog\u2014without the ex's knowledge, even if the ex handed her over under a misunderstanding\u2014might complicate things. If the ex believed the dog was being returned temporarily, the author's deception could be a factor in legal disputes. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the joint custody agreement was formalized legally. If it was a verbal agreement, the author might have the legal right to take the dog. But if the ex had a legitimate right to possession under the joint custody, then taking the dog without proper notice or legal process could be problematic. The author's actions, while driven by concern, might not be the best approach legally, even if they have ownership rights. However, the ex's refusal to compromise could also be an issue. \n\nI think the author is in a bind here. Legally, they own the dog, but the custody arrangement was joint. If the ex is not following the verbal agreement, maybe the author could have gone to court. Taking the dog without the ex's consent might be seen as taking the law into their own hands, even if they have a right. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the ex was violating their agreed terms, then the author might have a case. It's a bit of a grey area, but the act of stealing the dog, even if it's their own, is probably not the right approach. So the answer might be A.\n"
