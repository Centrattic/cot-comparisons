I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking their dog from their ex. The situation is about joint custody and legal ownership. The key points here are the legal ownership, the custody agreement, and the actions taken by the author.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they legally own the dog. In California, if they have legal papers stating ownership, that's a strong point. But since they had joint custody, there's a shared responsibility. The ex decided not to let the dog move to NYC, so the author took matters into their own hands by flying in and taking the dog without informing the ex. \n\nNow, the question is about legality and ethics. Legally, even if the author owns the dog, joint custody might require some agreement. If the ex was part of the custody arrangement, the author taking the dog without consent could be problematic. Even though the author owns the dog, the ex might have had temporary possession. The author's act of taking the dog without notice could be seen as interfering with the custody agreement, even if the ultimate owner is them.\n\nEthically, the author might feel they had no choice, but using deception (making the ex think they were just visiting) to take the dog could be seen as wrong. Also, the ex not being informed could lead to legal issues. The author might be at risk of being sued for unlawful taking, even if they own the dog. \n\nHowever, the author's argument is that their ex was manipulating and controlling, and the dog's well-being is better in NYC. But the ex's reasoning about the dog's quality of life in California is a valid point. The author's friends said the ex was manipulating, but that's subjective. \n\nIn terms of legal action, if the ex takes the dog to court, the author might have a case because they own the dog, but the methods used to retrieve it could affect the outcome. Courts usually look at both legal rights and the manner in which actions are taken. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they took the dog without proper legal process, which could be seen as an illegal seizure, even if they own the dog. The ex might have had temporary custody rights under the agreement. The author's actions, while driven by their belief in their rights, were possibly unlawful and could lead to legal consequences.\n"
