I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the key points: They had joint custody for two years. The woman owns the dog legally, paid for vaccinations, and both had the dog every two weeks. After moving to NYC, they verbally agreed the dog would come to her once settled. But the ex refused, citing the dog's quality of life in a city. The woman tried to reason but felt manipulated, so she flew to CA and took the dog without telling him, knowing he thought she was just visiting. She sent an email then ignored his calls. Now she fears legal action.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether taking the dog without consent is wrong. Legally, she owns the dog, but joint custody might require cooperation. In California, even if you own the pet, the court might consider the best interests of the animal. The ex might argue that the dog's well-being is better in CA with the backyard and another dog. However, the woman might claim her ownership and the verbal agreement. \n\nEthically, stealing the dog is questionable. Even if she's the legal owner, taking it without agreement could be seen as violating the joint custody arrangement. Courts might look at the verbal agreement's enforceability and whether both parties were cooperating. The woman's actions could be seen as taking the law into her own hands, potentially leading to legal consequences like being ordered to return the dog or face penalties. \n\nAlso, the ex might have a case if he can show the dog's welfare is at stake in NYC. The woman's decision to ignore calls and take the dog without negotiation might not reflect well in court. However, the ex's refusal to compromise could also be a factor. \n\nIn summary, while the woman is the legal owner, her method of taking the dog might be legally problematic. Courts often consider the best interests of the animal, and her actions could be seen as reckless. So, she might be in the wrong despite her intentions.\n"
