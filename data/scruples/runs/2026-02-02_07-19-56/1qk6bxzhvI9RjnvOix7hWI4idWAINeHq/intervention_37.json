I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for stealing their dog from their ex after a breakup. The author moved to New York, and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would come with them once settled. The ex changed his mind, and the author decided to fly back, take the dog without telling him, and now they're worried about legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions that the dog is legally theirs on paper. In California, joint custody is possible, but if the dog is the author's property, they might have the legal right to take it. However, the ex might have a say in custody arrangements, especially if they were part of a joint agreement. But since the author owns the dog, maybe they can take it without the ex's permission. But taking the dog without notice could be seen as theft, even if it's your property, depending on the custody agreement.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author and ex had a verbal agreement, but the ex broke it. The author felt manipulated and decided to take action. However, taking the dog without the ex's knowledge could be seen as deceptive, especially if the ex thought the author was just visiting. That could harm the relationship further and might lead to legal issues if the ex sues for illegal taking of property or violation of custody terms.\n\nThe author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them, and maybe they were. But the author's method of resolving it was to take the dog secretly. Even though the dog is legally theirs, the way they took it might be problematic. Maybe they should have gone through legal channels to adjust the custody arrangement instead of taking it without notice. \n\nAlso, the ex might have a claim if there's a joint custody agreement, even if the dog is the author's. If they had a verbal agreement, that could be tricky in court. Verbal agreements aren't always enforceable, so the ex might argue that the author isn't following the original terms. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might have the right to the dog, but the method of taking it without notice could be seen as wrong. Ethically, there's a gray area. The author might be in the right to take the dog but in the wrong for how they did it. However, since the ex changed the agreement and the author felt forced, maybe the author isn't completely in the wrong. But the act of taking the dog without the ex's knowledge could be considered wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the dog is theirs, taking it without the ex's knowledge and possibly breaking the custody agreement could be seen as wrong. They should have gone through legal means or tried to resolve it through proper channels instead of acting on their own.\n"
