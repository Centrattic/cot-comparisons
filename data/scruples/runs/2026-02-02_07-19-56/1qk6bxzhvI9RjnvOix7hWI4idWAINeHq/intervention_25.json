I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog custody issue after a breakup. The key points are:\n\n1. The person and their ex had joint custody of the dog, with the person legally owning the dog. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once the person was settled. However, the ex changed his mind and refused to bring the dog, claiming it's better for her in California. The person then flew to California and took the dog without the ex's knowledge, planning to keep her. The ex is now upset, and the person is worried about legal consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The person legally owns the dog, so maybe that's on their side. However, joint custody agreements, even verbal ones, can be tricky. In some states, verbal agreements might not hold up in court, especially if there's a written agreement. But here, it's mentioned that the joint custody was established for two years, with each taking turns every two weeks. The ex might argue that the verbal agreement to move the dog to NYC wasn't part of the original arrangement, so the person might not have the right to take the dog unilaterally.\n\nBut the person claims they had a verbal agreement. The problem is that verbal agreements can be hard to prove. The ex could contest that there was no such agreement, or that the person reneged. Even if there was an agreement, the ex might now be claiming that the circumstances have changed (like the dog's quality of life), which could be a factor in custody disputes.\n\nThe act of taking the dog without the ex's knowledge is a big issue. Even if the person legally owns the dog, abducting the dog without going through proper legal channels (like a court) could be seen as wrong. The ex might have had the right to temporary custody or could have sought legal recourse. By taking the dog without notice, the person might be violating the agreed-upon custody terms, regardless of the legal ownership.\n\nAlso, the person's friends thought the ex was manipulating them. That's a red flag, but it's their friends' opinion. The person might have felt pressured, but that doesn't necessarily justify taking the dog without proper legal steps. The ex could now take legal action, claiming that the person breached the custody agreement. The person's actions might be seen as selfish, even if they believe they were right.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person might be in the wrong because they took the dog without following legal procedures, even if they have legal ownership. The ex could argue that the verbal agreement was not binding and that the person is violating the custody arrangement. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
