I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who stole their dog from their ex is in the wrong. Let's look at the facts.\n\nFirst, legal ownership: the author says they legally own the dog on paper and paid for all vaccinations. They had joint custody for two years. Then they moved to New York, and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would come once settled. But the ex refused, saying the dog's quality of life is better in California. The author tried to reason but felt manipulated, so they went to California, took the dog without the ex knowing, and the ex handed her over thinking it was a visit. The ex is upset and might take legal action.\n\nNow, in terms of the law, if the author has legal ownership, they might have the right to take the dog back. But joint custody usually means both parties have shared responsibilities. The ex might have a claim if there was a custody agreement in place. The author took the dog without notice, which could be seen as interfering with the custody arrangement. Even if the author is the legal owner, the ex might have rights under the custody terms. \n\nAlso, the method of taking the dog\u2014without the ex's knowledge\u2014could be problematic. The ex might feel that the author breached the agreement or acted in bad faith. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulating, but the ex's concern about the dog's well-being in NYC might have some validity. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, taking a pet without the other party's consent, even if you're the legal owner, can lead to legal issues if it violates a custody agreement. The author might be justified in wanting the dog, but the way they went about it could be seen as wrong. They should have perhaps sought legal recourse first instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, while the author has legal ownership, the method of taking the dog without following proper legal procedures might make them at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
