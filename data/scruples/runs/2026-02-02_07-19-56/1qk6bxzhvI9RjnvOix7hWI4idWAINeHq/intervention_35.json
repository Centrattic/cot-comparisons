I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the key points: They had joint custody for two years in California, with the woman legally owning the dog. After moving to NYC, there was a verbal agreement that the dog would come with her once settled. The ex then refused to transfer the dog, claiming it's better for the dog's quality of life in CA. The author went to CA, tricked the ex into thinking she was just visiting, took the dog, and didn't answer his calls afterward. Now she's worried about being taken to court.\n\nSo, the main question is about legal and moral responsibility. The author is the legal owner, so she might have a right to her dog. But the ex had been part of joint custody. When she moved, the ex changed the arrangement and the dog didn't move. The author then took matters into her own hands by taking the dog without the ex's knowledge, using a trick.\n\nLegally, joint custody in California typically requires both parties to agree on the dog's relocation, especially if it's a significant move across the country. Even though the author is the legal owner, the ex might have had the right to object to the relocation, which could lead to a court case. The author taking the dog without consent could result in legal consequences, like contempt or even losing custody.\n\nMoral-wise, the author wanted to do what's best for the dog, but the method of taking her without the ex's knowledge and lying might be questionable. The ex might have had valid reasons for not wanting to move the dog, like the dog's well-being. The author's action could be seen as deceptive, even if done to get their own dog back.\n\nThe ex's argument about the dog's quality of life in NYC versus CA is a factor. Even if the author believes the dog would be fine, the ex's refusal might be based on genuine concerns. The author's friends said the ex was manipulating, but that's possible. However, the act of stealing the dog without legal process is problematic.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow proper legal channels and used deception. Even if they had rights, the method could backfire legally. Also, the ex might have had a legitimate right to object to the relocation, making the author's actions unlawful. The answer would be A.\n"
