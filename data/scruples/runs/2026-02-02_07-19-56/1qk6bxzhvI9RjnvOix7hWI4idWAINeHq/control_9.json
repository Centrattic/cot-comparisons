I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stealing their dog from the ex. So first, I need to understand the situation. They had joint custody for two years in California. The author legally owns the dog and paid for everything. They broke up last year, but kept the custody arrangement. The ex moved to California, and the author moved to NYC. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would come to NYC once the author was settled. But then the ex changed his mind, saying the dog would be unhappy in NYC. The author tried to argue but the ex wouldn't compromise. Friends said the ex was manipulating, and the author decided to fly in and take the dog without the ex's knowledge. The ex then tried to call, but the author didn't answer.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the legality and the ethics. The author says they are the legal owner. In California, joint custody of a pet is possible, but if the author is the legal owner, maybe the ex doesn't have the right to keep the dog. But the author took the dog without consent, which could be considered theft. Even if the author is the legal owner, the ex might have had rights under the joint custody agreement. The verbal agreement might not be enough if the ex refuses to comply. The author could be facing legal trouble for taking the dog without following proper procedures. Also, the emotional aspect is there\u2014taking the dog might have been hurtful, but the author feels they had no choice. The ex might have a case if the joint custody was part of the original agreement. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they broke the agreement without legal recourse. Even if the ex was manipulative, taking the dog secretly could be illegal.\n"
