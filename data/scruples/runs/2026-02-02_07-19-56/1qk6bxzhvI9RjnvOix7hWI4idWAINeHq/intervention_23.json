I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for stealing their own dog back from their ex. The situation is that they had joint custody in California, the dog is legally theirs, and after moving to NYC, they tried to get the dog but the ex wouldn't agree. The author then flew back, took the dog without the ex's knowledge, and hasn't responded to his calls. The question is if this makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The dog is legally the author's, so they have ownership rights. But joint custody was agreed upon. Even though they moved, the ex might still be following the original custody arrangement. The author decided to take the dog without the ex's consent, which could be seen as breaking the agreement they had. However, since it's their legal property, maybe taking it back isn't illegal. But custody agreements usually require mutual respect, so maybe acting unilaterally is problematic.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The ex might truly believe that the dog's life is better in California with more space, another dog, and the beach. The author, on the other hand, feels they have no choice because the ex was being unreasonable. The ex might feel betrayed, especially if he thought they had a verbal agreement. The author's actions, while maybe legally justified in ownership, could be ethically questionable because they went against the custody agreement and the ex's expectations.\n\nAlso, the author's friends said the ex was manipulating them, but the ex might have just been trying to do what he thought was best for the dog. The author might have a point if the ex was being controlling, but taking the dog without a proper agreement could lead to legal issues. Even if the dog is legally theirs, the ex could contest the custody terms, especially since they have joint custody. The author didn't try to go through legal channels first, which might be necessary.\n\nSo, the answer is tricky. Legally, they own the dog, but ethically, disrupting the custody agreement and taking the dog without consent might not be the right approach. They should have sought legal advice to formalize the new arrangement considering the move. Instead, they acted on their own, which could harm the relationship and possibly lead to legal problems. The ex might have a valid claim if there's a court order or if the verbal agreement was part of a custody arrangement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not following proper legal procedures and breaching the custody agreement, even if the dog is their legal property.\n"
