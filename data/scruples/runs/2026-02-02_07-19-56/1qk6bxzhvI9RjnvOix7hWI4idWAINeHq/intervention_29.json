I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person and their ex-boyfriend had joint custody of their dog. They were in California, and she moved to NYC. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would come to NYC once she was settled. But the ex refused to let the dog move, arguing the dog's quality of life would be better in California. The person tried to negotiate but felt manipulated, so they flew to California and took the dog without telling the ex, who handed her over thinking they were just visiting. The person then left, sent an email, and the ex has been trying to reach them. The person is worried about legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The person legally owns the dog, so the ex doesn't have legal ownership. However, joint custody typically means both parties have shared responsibilities. Even if the person is the legal owner, the ex might have had agreed-upon custody rights. Taking the dog without informing the ex could be a breach of that custody agreement. \n\nBut the ex is not the legal owner, so the person might have the right to take legal ownership. However, the way it was done\u2014without informing the ex, lying about the purpose of the visit\u2014could be problematic. The ex might feel that the joint custody arrangement was not respected. Even if the ex was being difficult, the person could have gone through legal channels instead of taking the dog secretly. \n\nAlso, the ex might argue that the joint custody agreement was part of their understanding, so the person taking the dog without consent could be seen as breaking that agreement. Legally, joint custody might require some form of agreement when one party moves away. The person moving to NYC might need to adjust the custody arrangement through legal means, like a court, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAdditionally, the person's actions might be seen as unethical because they lied to the ex about their intentions. Even if the ex is being unreasonable, using deception to take the dog could be considered wrong. The person could have sought mediation or legal advice instead of resorting to a secret retrieval.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex might be using the dog as a way to control or manipulate the person, especially since they were in a breakup. The person might feel they had no choice, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right. The ethical side is tricky here\u2014balancing legal rights with the moral implications of the method used.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the legal owner can reclaim their pet, but the process usually involves proper notice and legal procedures. The person's approach might be legally permissible but ethically questionable. The ex could still face challenges if the person is the legal owner, but the way the dog was taken could lead to legal complications, like accusations of theft or breach of custody agreement.\n\nSo considering all this, the person's actions were self-serving to protect their legal rights, but the method used (deception, not following agreed-upon custody terms) might put them in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
