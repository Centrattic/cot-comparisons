I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about taking back their dog from their ex after a breakup, with joint custody. The key points are that the author legally owns the dog, there was a verbal agreement, but the ex changed his mind when the author moved to NYC. The author then flew to California to take the dog without the ex's knowledge, leading to the ex's anger and possible legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions they legally own the dog. In California, if there's a joint custody agreement, both parties usually have rights. But if the dog is legally the author's, maybe the ex is not supposed to keep her without consent. However, the ex might have a claim if the custody arrangement was part of a legal agreement. The user didn't mention a court order, just a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements aren't as strong in court, so maybe the author's actions were based on their legal ownership.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Taking the dog without the ex's knowledge could be seen as deceptive. Even if the author is legally right, the method used might be questionable. The ex might feel violated, especially if he thought the author was just visiting. The author's friends said the ex was manipulating, which adds context. The author might have felt cornered, but taking the dog covertly could be seen as wrong, regardless of legal standing.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the dog and both parties. The author feels bad about splitting them apart, but maybe the dog's well-being in NYC is a valid concern. However, the sudden move might stress the dog. The ex might have a legal case if he claims the author acted without following the custody agreement, even if it was verbal.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might have a legal right to the dog, but the method of taking her without informing the ex could be ethically wrong. The answer might depend on the specific laws in California regarding pet custody and verbal agreements. Since the author is in the US, and California typically considers the best interest of the pet, but without a court order, the legal ownership might prevail. However, the act of taking the dog without notice could be seen as wrong, even if legally justified. So, the answer might be a mix, but since the question is A or B, I need to choose based on whether the action was wrong despite legal rights. I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because even if legally correct, the method was deceptive and could lead to legal consequences from the ex. Or B (not in the wrong) if the legal ownership is the main factor. But given that the ex had joint custody and the taking was without consent, maybe the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, if the ex breached the verbal agreement and the author acted to reclaim legal ownership, it's less clear. But I'm leaning towards A because taking the dog without notice and possibly breaching the custody agreement, even if verbal, is problematic. So, the answer is A."
