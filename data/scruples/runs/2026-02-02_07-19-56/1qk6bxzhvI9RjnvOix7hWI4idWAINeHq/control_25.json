I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person in the situation took their dog from their ex without his knowledge, even though they had a joint custody agreement. The dog is legally theirs, but the ex had custody. The key points here are about legal custody, the terms of the agreement, and the method used to retrieve the dog.\n\nFirst, joint custody usually means both parties have shared responsibility and rights. Even if the dog is legally the person's, the ex's custody rights might still be in place. Taking the dog without the ex's consent, especially through deception, could be a violation of that agreement. The person says they tried to argue but the ex wouldn't compromise. However, even if they felt manipulated, taking the dog without going through legal channels might not be the right approach. \n\nThe person mentions they sent an email after the fact and the ex tried to contact them. The ex might have legal recourse here, like taking the matter to court. The fact that the dog is in a new environment and the ex might have a claim could make the person liable. Even if their intention was to follow the law, the act of taking the dog without consent could be seen as wrongful, especially if the custody agreement was still in effect. \n\nOn the other hand, the person might argue that the ex was being unreasonable, but that doesn't necessarily justify breaking the agreement. The correct course would have been to seek legal mediation or court action to resolve the custody issue. Since they took matters into their own hands, they might be in the wrong, regardless of their intentions.\n"
