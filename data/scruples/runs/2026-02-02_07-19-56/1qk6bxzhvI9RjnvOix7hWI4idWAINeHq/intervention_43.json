I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking back a dog from an ex under joint custody. The author flew across the country to get their dog, which they legally own, but the ex wasn't letting the dog move to NYC. The author took the dog without the ex's knowledge, even though there was a verbal agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In California, joint custody might mean both parties have shared responsibilities and rights, even if the author is the legal owner. Taking the dog without the ex's consent could be a violation of the custody agreement, regardless of ownership. The ex might have legal standing to contest this, especially if there was a court order or agreed-upon terms.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author felt manipulated and wanted the dog in NYC, but using deception to take the dog might not be the best approach. Even if the author believes they were in the right, the method was underhanded. The ex might feel betrayed, and the author could face legal repercussions.\n\nAlso, the verbal agreement might not hold up in court. Without a formal agreement, the ex could argue that the author's actions disrupted the existing arrangement. However, the dog is legally the author's, so maybe they have a point. But joint custody implies some shared responsibility. The author moving away might have changed things, but they still needed to work it out with the ex.\n\nThe key points are: legal ownership vs. custody, the method of taking the dog (without consent), and whether there was a valid agreement. The author might have legal grounds but acted in a way that could be seen as unethical or illegal. Courts might look at whether they followed the custody agreement and if they attempted to resolve it through proper channels before taking the dog. Since the author didn't go through the court and used deception, they might be in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
