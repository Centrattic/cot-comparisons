I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for taking their dog back from their ex without his knowledge. They had joint custody, but they own the dog legally. They moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come once they were settled. The ex changed his mind, saying the dog would be better in California with a backyard and a companion. The author tried to argue but eventually gave in, feeling manipulated. Then they flew out to take the dog, which the ex handed over thinking they were just visiting. The author then left, sent an email, and the ex has been calling a lot.\n\nHmm. Legally, the author owns the dog, so maybe they have a right to take it back. But the ex had custody, or was it joint? Wait, the author says they had joint custody for two years. So maybe the ex had a say in where the dog stays. But the author says they have the legal ownership. In some states, animal custody can be tricky. California might handle it differently. If the ex had a court order or some legal arrangement, taking the dog without permission could be problematic. But if the agreement was verbal, that's not as strong. The author might have a legal claim, but taking the dog without notice could be seen as theft or abduction, even if it's a pet.\n\nAlso, the ex handed over the dog thinking the author was just visiting. So maybe the ex didn't know they were taking her permanently. The author's action of not answering calls after taking the dog might be seen as fleeing, which could lead to legal issues. The ex might try to sue for custody or claim theft. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulating, but that's subjective. The author might feel justified, but legally, they could be in trouble. Ethically, taking the dog without consent is questionable, even if they own it. The ex had been part of the dog's life and might have a legitimate concern about the dog's well-being. The author's action might be seen as overstepping, especially if they didn't follow proper legal channels. So, even if they have legal ownership, the method of taking the dog might be wrong. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
