I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for stealing their dog back from their ex. They had joint custody, but the dog is legally theirs. The ex moved to California, and the person went to New York. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would come to NYC once settled. The ex backed out, leading the person to fly in and take the dog secretly.\n\nFirst, joint custody usually means both parties share responsibility. Even though the dog is legally their property, taking it without the ex's consent could be a problem. The ex might have legal rights under the custody agreement. The person might have breached the agreement by taking the dog without proper process. Also, using deception by making the ex think they were just visiting could lead to legal issues, like false pretenses. \n\nEven though the ex might be manipulative, stealing the dog isn't the right approach. The person should have gone through legal channels first. They could have petitioned the court for a modification of the custody arrangement. Taking matters into their own hands might lead to legal consequences, like being charged with theft or violating custody terms. Also, the ex could seek legal action to get the dog back, leading to a court battle where the person might lose if the court deems their actions improper. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The person might feel they're protecting the dog's well-being, but the method of taking the dog secretly is problematic. The ex might have a valid point about the dog's quality of life. However, the legal ownership is on the person's side, so there's a strong argument there too. But the method of retrieval without legal recourse is the main issue. So, the person is in the wrong because they bypassed the legal system and potentially violated the custody agreement. They should have used legal means to resolve the dispute instead of taking the dog secretly.\n"
