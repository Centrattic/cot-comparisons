I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody dispute after a breakup. The author and their ex have joint custody, but the dog is legally the author's. They moved to NYC, and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would come there once the author was settled. But the ex didn't let the dog move, saying it's better for her in California. The author tried to argue but eventually gave in, then flew back to take the dog without the ex knowing, even though the ex had a verbal agreement to let her come.\n\nFirst, I need to recall if California and New York have specific laws about pet custody. I know in some places, pets are considered property, so the legal owner can take them back if necessary. The author mentions the dog is legally theirs, so maybe that's a key point. But joint custody complicates things. Even if the dog is the author's, joint custody might imply some shared responsibility. However, since they had a verbal agreement, if the ex is breaking that, the author might have a right to enforce it through legal means. But taking the dog without consent could be seen as a problem, even if it's their legal pet. \n\nWait, the ex didn't allow the dog to move as agreed. If the author had a legal contract or some written agreement, they could go to court. But since it's a verbal agreement, it's harder to enforce. The ex might have been within his rights to not comply with a verbal agreement, especially if they were co-owners. However, the author is the legal owner, so maybe they can take the dog back. But taking them without consent and during a time when the ex was supposed to have her, even if under a verbal arrangement, might be considered theft. The ex might not have agreed to give up possession, so the author taking the dog without permission could be illegal, regardless of ownership. \n\nAlso, the author said they let the ex think they were just visiting, then took the dog. That seems deceptive. Even if you own the pet, taking them through a lie might be unethical. The ex could argue that the author is breaching the joint custody agreement by removing the dog without mutual consent. In some states, joint custody might require both parties to agree on major decisions, so the author might have had to go to court instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nAnother angle: the author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them. Maybe the ex is trying to keep the dog because it's a way to maintain control. The author might feel they were wronged, but using force or deception to retrieve the dog could make them the asshole. However, if the ex was violating the verbal agreement and the author is the legal owner, some might argue the author was justified in taking back what's theirs. \n\nBut the problem is that verbal agreements can be tricky in court. If there's no written custody arrangement, the ex could claim that the dog is being kept due to the best interest of the pet, especially if the author moves to a less suitable environment. However, the author is the legal owner, so maybe the ex has no legal right to prevent the dog from moving. \n\nIn California, pets are considered property, so the legal owner could potentially take the dog back if there's no court order. However, joint custody arrangements might need to be handled through the court. The author didn't go through the legal system and instead took the dog secretly, which could be seen as wrong because they didn't follow proper procedures. \n\nSo, the author is the legal owner, which is a strong point, but the method of taking the dog without consent might be problematic. If they had gone to court to modify the custody agreement, that would be the right way. Instead, they acted on their own, which could lead to legal issues. The ex might have a case if there's a custody arrangement in place, even if verbal. \n\nAlso, the ex might have been trying to control the author by keeping the dog, which could be a valid concern. But legally, if the author is the owner, the ex shouldn't be able to do that. However, the author could have been more proactive in seeking legal action instead of taking the dog. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be justifiable if the ex is violating the verbal agreement and the author is the legal owner. But the method of taking the dog without consent and through deception could make them the asshole. The right approach would have been to seek legal intervention, not to take the pet without notice. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow legal procedures and acted deceptively, even though they own the dog.\n"
