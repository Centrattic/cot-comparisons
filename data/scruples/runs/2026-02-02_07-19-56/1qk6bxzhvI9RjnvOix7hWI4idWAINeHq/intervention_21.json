I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who stole their dog from their ex is in the wrong. The situation involves joint custody, but the author legally owns the dog. They moved to New York and had a verbal agreement to bring the dog there. The ex refused, leading the author to take the dog without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Even though they have joint custody, the author is the legal owner. In California, joint custody in pet cases is not as clear as with children, but since the author has the legal papers, they have more rights. However, taking the dog without a court order might still be problematic. The ex might argue that the joint custody agreement was a mutual understanding, even if not formalized. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author admits to lying to the ex, which could be seen as manipulative. Also, causing emotional distress to the ex by taking the dog without notice. But the author's motivation was concern for the dog's well-being and their legal ownership. \n\nThe ex might retaliate legally, but the author's actions were driven by legal ownership and the dog's best interest. However, using force or deception could still be seen as wrong, even if the intent was good. The key is whether the author had a legal right to take the dog. Since they are the legal owner, maybe not in the wrong, but the method was questionable. \n\nAlso, joint custody in pets is tricky. If the ex was following the previous agreement and the author broke it, that could be an issue. But the ex changed the terms after the move. The author felt cornered and took action to get their dog back. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong legally due to ownership, but ethically, there's a gray area. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the legal ownership is on their side, but the method of taking the dog without consent is iffy. Courts usually consider agreements, but the author's actions might still be justified under their legal rights.\n"
