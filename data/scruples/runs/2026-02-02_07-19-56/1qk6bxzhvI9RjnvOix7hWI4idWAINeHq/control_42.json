I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a dog custody issue between an ex-boyfriend and the author. They had joint custody in California for two years, and the author legally owns the dog. After moving to NYC, they had a verbal agreement that the dog would come to NYC once they were settled, but the ex changed his mind, saying the dog would be better off in California with a backyard and another dog. The author tried to reason but felt manipulated, so they flew back and took the dog without the ex's knowledge, sent an email, and blocked his calls. Now they're worried about being taken to court.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author says the dog is legally theirs. In California, pet custody can be tricky. Even if one person owns the dog on paper, joint custody agreements between exes might require some form of legal documentation. If they only had a verbal agreement, that could be an issue. The ex might have a claim if they had a cohabitation or pet custody agreement that wasn't formalized. But since the author is the legal owner, maybe they have more rights here.\n\nHowever, taking the dog without the ex's knowledge could be problematic. Even if the author owns the dog, doing so without notice might be considered theft or a violation of the custody agreement. The ex might argue that the verbal agreement was binding and that the author broke it by taking the dog. Also, stealing the dog (even if it's their own) could lead to legal consequences, like being charged with theft or kidnapping, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nEmotionally, the author is conflicted because they feel the dog's well-being is at stake but are also upset about the ex's actions. They mention that their friends said the ex was manipulating them. If the ex was indeed using the dog's welfare as an excuse to keep her, that's one thing. But if the author acted impulsively without a legal plan, they might be in a tight spot.\n\nThe key points are: the legal ownership, the verbal agreement's enforceability, the method of retrieving the dog (stealing without notice), and possible legal repercussions. In many states, pets are considered property, so the legal owner can take them back, but the process might require proper legal steps. If the ex had been caring for the dog, maybe there's a caretaker's rights angle, but that varies by state. California has some laws where if someone has been caring for a pet, they might have rights, but since the author is the registered owner, that could tip the scales in their favor.\n\nBut taking the dog without consent, even if it's your own, could be seen as wrong unless you have a legal order. The author might have had the right to take the dog back, but the method\u2014without informing the ex\u2014could lead to charges. So, possible answer A (they are in the wrong) if the ex had a legitimate claim based on the verbal agreement. But if the verbal agreement wasn't enforceable and the author is the legal owner, then maybe answer B (not in the wrong). However, the act of taking the dog without notice is a point against them. Also, the ex letting the dog go to the airport might indicate he was okay with the transfer, but if he had different intentions, that's a different story. It's a bit ambiguous, but I think the act of stealing the dog without legal process is a problem, even if the author is the owner. So the answer might be A.\n"
