I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for stealing their dog from their ex after a breakup. The scenario involves joint custody, legal ownership, and a conflict over where the dog should live.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The person says they legally own the dog on paper and have paid for all vaccinations. In California, pet custody laws can vary, but generally, pets are considered property. So if the dog is legally their property, they might have a stronger legal claim. However, joint custody agreements usually involve both parties agreeing on terms. The fact that the ex broke the verbal agreement by not sending the dog to NYC when the person moved there is a key point. But the person decided to take the dog without the ex's knowledge, which could be seen as a breach of the prior agreement, even if it's verbal. \n\nThen there's the method of taking the dog. The person flew to California, got the dog without the ex knowing, and sent an email after. The ex called multiple times and there was no answer. This could be seen as a violation of trust and maybe even illegal if the ex had a legal right to the dog temporarily. However, since the person claims legal ownership, maybe they had the right to reclaim the dog. But taking it without notice or negotiation could lead to legal issues, like trespassing or theft of property if the ex had a custody arrangement in place. \n\nAlso, the ex's reasoning about the dog's quality of life in NYC versus California is a point. The person argued that the dog would be fine in NYC, but the ex believed it was better for the dog in California. This creates a conflict of interests. The person might feel wronged because the ex isn't honoring the verbal agreement, but the ex might feel that the person isn't considering the dog's well-being. \n\nThe person's friends said the ex was manipulating them, leading to the decision to take the dog. However, taking the dog without consent, even if feeling manipulated, could be seen as illegal or at least unethical. The person might be in the wrong for not trying to resolve it through legal means first, instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nIn conclusion, while the person may have a legal claim to the dog, the method of reclaiming it without notice and causing distress to the ex could make them the asshole in the situation. The ex might have legal recourse if they can prove they had temporary custody or if the person's actions were disruptive. So the answer might lean towards \"Yes,\" the author is in the wrong.\n"
