I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody issue between an ex and the author. The author claims to legally own the dog and had joint custody. When they broke up, they had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to the author's new place in NYC once settled. But the ex refused, and the author decided to fly to California to take the dog without the ex knowing, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author says the dog is legally theirs on paper. In California, if the dog is legally owned by the author, they have the right to the dog. However, joint custody might mean that both parties have rights to care for the dog, even if ownership is on the author's name. But since the author moved away, the arrangement might need to be renegotiated. \n\nThe ex might argue that the dog's well-being is better in California with a backyard and another dog. But the author might feel that the ex is being controlling. The key point is whether the author's actions of taking the dog without consent are justified.\n\nLegally, even if the author owns the dog, taking it without the ex's consent could be seen as a violation of their custody agreement. The ex might have had visitation rights, and suddenly taking the dog could disrupt that. The author might be justified in trying to follow the original agreement, but using force or deception to take the dog could be problematic. Courts might consider both the legal ownership and the circumstances surrounding the dog's removal. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author is trying to assert their legal rights but might be causing emotional distress to the ex. The ex might feel wronged by the sudden separation of the dog. However, if the author is the legal owner and the verbal agreement was not honored, taking action to retrieve the dog could be seen as necessary. \n\nBut since the author used deception (making the ex think they were just visiting), that could be a point against them. Courts might not look favorably on such tactics, even if the legal ownership is in their name. The author might be the asshole for not following through legally, like getting a court order, instead of acting on their own.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author might be in the wrong because their actions, while possibly justified by legal ownership, were taken without proper legal procedure and involved deception.\n"
