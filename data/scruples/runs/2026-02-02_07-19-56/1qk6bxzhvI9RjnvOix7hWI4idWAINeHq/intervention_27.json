I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody battle between the author and their ex-boyfriend. They were in a joint custody arrangement for two years, and the author legally owns the dog. After moving to NYC, the ex refused to let the dog come, so the author flew across the country to take the dog without the ex's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the author says they own the dog on paper. In many places, including California, when you have joint custody of a pet, there might be a court order or some agreement in place. If the author has legal ownership, they might have the right to take the dog. But just because they own it doesn't mean they can take it without following the agreed-upon custody terms. If there's a custody agreement, even if the author is the legal owner, they might need to follow the terms of that agreement. If the ex was part of the custody arrangement, the author taking the dog without consent could be a breach of that agreement, even if they own the dog.\n\nThen there's the method they used. They took the dog without the ex knowing, which is a form of deception. The ex might have a valid claim of theft or unlawful taking of the pet. Even if the author's intention was to follow the original verbal agreement, breaking into the custody agreement by stealth could lead to legal issues. The ex could potentially sue for illegal taking of the pet, even if the author is the legal owner. \n\nAlso, the situation mentions that the ex handed the dog over, thinking it was just a visit, but the author had no intention of returning her. That's a lie, and lying to get back a pet could be seen as unethical or even illegal, depending on state laws. Some states treat pet custody like property, but others might consider it more like child custody, where the well-being of the pet is a factor. However, since the author is the legal owner, maybe they have a stronger case, but the method of taking the dog without consent complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the author's ex is not the legal owner but was part of the custody arrangement. If the author is the sole legal owner, then maybe they have the right to take the dog, but if the custody agreement was part of a court order or mutual understanding, then ignoring that could be problematic. The author might have breached the agreement by not following through the proper channels. Instead of taking the dog secretly, they should have sought legal recourse if the ex wasn't complying with the verbal agreement.\n\nAlso, the ex's argument about the dog's quality of life in NYC versus California could be a point. If the ex is genuinely concerned about the dog's well-being, maybe the court would consider that. But the author might argue that the dog's best interest is with them now in NYC. However, the method of taking the dog without legal process might not help their case.\n\nIn terms of ethics, taking the dog secretly could be seen as underhanded. Even if the author believes they're in the right, the way they went about it could be considered wrong. The ex might feel violated and could retaliate legally. So, while the author might have a legal claim, their actions might not be the most ethical or appropriate way to handle the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author is the legal owner, the method of taking the dog without the ex's consent might be in the wrong, both legally and ethically. The author should have gone through the proper legal channels to resolve the custody issue rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n"
