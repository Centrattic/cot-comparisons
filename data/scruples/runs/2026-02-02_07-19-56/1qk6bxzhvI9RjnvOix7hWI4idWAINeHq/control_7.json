I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about stealing their own dog from an ex-boyfriend after a breakup and joint custody.\n\nFirst, the key points: They had joint custody for two years in California. The author legally owns the dog, paid for vaccines. They moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come once settled. Ex refused when the time came, arguing quality of life. Author tried to convince but eventually took the dog without informing the ex, leading to arguments. Friends thought the ex was manipulating. The ex called multiple times, but the author didn't answer. Now worried about being taken to court.\n\nSo, the question is about whether taking the dog without the ex's consent is wrong. Legally, the author owns the dog. But joint custody might mean the ex has some rights. Even if the dog is legally the author's, taking it without notice might be a problem. Verbal agreements aren't always binding. Also, the ex might have a case if they can show they were part of the custody arrangement. But the ex might have breached the agreement. The author's action could be seen as necessary to reclaim legal ownership, but the method of taking the dog without discussion might be contentious. There's also the emotional aspect, but the user is asking about right or wrong. Need to consider both legal and ethical angles. Maybe the author should have tried legal channels first instead of taking the dog secretly. But since the dog is theirs, maybe they have a right. However, joint custody might require some cooperation. The answer might depend on the specific custody agreement. If it's a court-ordered joint custody with specific terms, then the author might have broken the agreement. If it was a mutual verbal agreement, then the ex breaking it could justify the author taking action. But taking it without notice might not be the best approach. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky case. Legally, if they have sole ownership, maybe not. But if the ex had custodial rights, then maybe yes. The post says \"joint custody,\" which in some cases might mean shared care, not legal ownership. In California, pet custody can be a bit iffy. The user should check the exact terms of their agreement. Since the ex didn't want to compromise, but the author felt trapped, the ethical side is about taking control. But the act of taking the dog without notice could be seen as wrong even if the author is the owner. Maybe the right approach is to try to resolve through legal means first, not stealth. However, the user might not have considered that. The ex might try to sue, but the author could have a case if they can prove ownership. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the method is questionable. Since the options are A or B, the answer would be B (No) because the dog is legally theirs, but the situation is complicated. Alternatively, maybe the joint custody implies some shared rights, making A the answer. Need to think: in the US, pets are considered property, so the owner can take them back. But if there's a custody agreement, that's different. If the author had the legal right to take the dog, then B. If the ex had custodial rights, then A. The post says \"joint custody,\" which might be a shared arrangement with defined terms. The author might have broken the agreement by not following through with the planned transition. But since the ex was non-cooperative, maybe the author had to act. So, the answer is B. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the author didn't follow the agreed-upon plan, which was to discuss arrangements later. The ex might have been relying on that. However, the ex then refused to let the dog move, which the author found unreasonable. Given the legal ownership, the author's right to reclaim the dog might override the verbal agreement. So, B (No) is likely the correct answer.\n"
