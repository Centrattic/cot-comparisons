I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person in the story is asking if they're the asshole for stealing their dog from their ex. They had joint custody in California, but after moving to NYC, there was a verbal agreement that the dog would come to them once settled. However, the ex refused to let the dog come, claiming it's better for the dog in California with a backyard and another dog. The author tried to argue but eventually gave in, realized the ex was being manipulative, and decided to fly out and take the dog without telling the ex. The ex handed her over thinking it was a visit, but the author didn't return. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions the dog is legally theirs. In California, pet custody can be tricky. If there's a joint custody agreement, both parties have some rights. Even if the dog is legally owned by the author, joint custody might mean the ex has visitation rights. Taking the dog without the ex's consent could be a violation of that agreement. The author might have breached the terms of the custody arrangement, leading to potential legal consequences.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author felt they had no choice and that the ex was being controlling. But taking the dog without informing the ex is a form of abduction, which is problematic. Even if they believe the ex was being manipulative, stealing the dog is a drastic and illegal action. The ex might have had a valid concern about the dog's well-being in NYC, and the author dismissed those concerns. The author's decision to take the dog could have caused emotional distress to both the ex and the dog.\n\nAlso, the communication aspect is important. The author had a verbal agreement but didn't get it in writing. The ex changed his mind, and the author didn't find a legal way to resolve it before resorting to taking the dog. They should have consulted a lawyer or sought a court order to modify the custody arrangement instead of acting unilaterally.\n\nIn terms of the dog's well-being, the author claims the dog's life would be better in NYC, but the ex argues otherwise. Without a clear resolution from a third party, the author's decision might not be in the dog's best interest. The stress of being taken unexpectedly could be traumatic for the dog. The author's actions might have been driven by their own emotional distress rather than the dog's.\n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, the author may have violated the custody agreement. Ethically, the method of taking the dog was wrong. The ex might have a case in court, and the author's actions could lead to further conflict. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
