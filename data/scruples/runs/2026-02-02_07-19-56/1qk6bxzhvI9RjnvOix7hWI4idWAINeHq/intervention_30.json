I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a dog custody dispute between an ex-boyfriend and the author. They were in a joint custody arrangement for two years in California. The author legally owns the dog, paid for all the vaccinations, and they had a system where they took turns every two weeks. Then the author moved to NYC, and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would move there once they were settled. But the ex refused to let the dog come, and the author felt manipulated, so they flew back, took the dog without telling the ex, and now the ex is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author says they own the dog legally. In California, if there's a joint custody agreement, even if one person owns the dog, both might have rights. But since the author moved to NYC, the ex might have been the primary caregiver now. However, the author claims they had a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be tricky in court because they're hard to prove. \n\nThe author didn't go through the proper legal channels. Instead of seeking a court order or mediation, they took the dog without the ex's consent. Even though the ex tried to keep the dog in California, the author's actions could be seen as theft or breach of the custody agreement. The ex might have a legal case against the author for interfering with the dog's care, even if it's the author's property. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels they had no choice, but legally, taking the dog without proper procedure is problematic. The ex might argue that the dog was better off in California with a yard and another dog. The author could be liable for damages or forced to return the dog through a court. \n\nSo the main issue is whether taking the dog without legal process is acceptable. Since the author had a verbal agreement but didn't follow up with legal steps, they might be in the wrong. Also, the ex could have a valid claim if the court considers the dog's best interests and the existing custody arrangement. The author's actions, while motivated by their belief in ownership, might not be legally sound. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't follow proper legal procedures and could be violating the custody agreement.\n"
