I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute after a breakup. The writer flew to California to take their dog back from their ex, who they have joint custody with. The dog is legally theirs, but the ex didn't want to send her to NYC. The writer took the dog without informing the ex, leading to the question of whether they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The dog is legally the writer's, so they have ownership rights. However, joint custody might imply some shared responsibility. The ex might have had possession of the dog, even if not the legal owner. The writer's actions could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of going through legal channels. But since the dog is their legal property, maybe they have the right to reclaim it.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The ex and the writer had a verbal agreement, which the ex broke. The writer felt manipulated and controlled by the ex. Taking the dog without notice could be seen as a preemptive move to prevent the ex from keeping it permanently. However, stealing the dog, even if it's your own, might be considered wrong because it disregards the ex's current care of the dog and the custody arrangement.\n\nAlso, the method used\u2014flying across the country to take the dog without informing the ex\u2014could be seen as deceptive. The ex might feel that their rights as a co-custodian were violated, even if the legal ownership is on the writer's side. The ex might have a case in court if they argue about the custody terms not being followed properly.\n\nThe writer mentions that the ex wasn't willing to compromise, and friends thought the ex was manipulating. But in a custody situation, both parties are supposed to cooperate. If the ex is uncooperative, the legal system should be involved rather than taking the dog without consent. Courts usually consider the best interests of the animal, which might involve shared custody or other arrangements if it's in the dog's best interest.\n\nHowever, the writer's claim that the dog's quality of life would be better in NYC versus California is a factor. If the legal system prioritizes the animal's well-being, the writer might have a valid argument. But the writer didn't take the dog through legal channels, which could be a problem.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, even if you own an animal, you can't just take it without following the agreed-upon custody terms. The ex might have had temporary possession, and the writer's unauthorized retrieval could be a legal issue. The fact that the writer sent an email after taking the dog shows they were aware of potential conflict but chose to proceed anyway.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the writer might be seen as acting in their rights as the owner but in a way that's not cooperative and could lead to legal consequences. The ex could potentially take them to court for not following the custody agreement. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong because they didn't use the proper legal channels and acted unilaterally, even if their intentions were based on what they believe is right.\n"
