I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute between an ex-couple. The key points are that they had a joint custody agreement, the woman legally owns the dog, she moved to NYC, and there was a verbal agreement for the dog to come to her once settled. The ex then refused to let the dog move, so she flew to California and took the dog without informing him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the woman is the legal owner, she has rights. However, the ex had been part of joint custody. Even if she's the legal owner, joint custody agreements usually involve shared responsibilities. Taking the dog without the other party's consent, especially in a joint custody setup, could be problematic. Even if the ex was being difficult, the correct approach might have been to seek a court order or mediation instead of taking unilateral action.\n\nThen there's the verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be hard to enforce, especially in legal terms. So the ex might argue that the agreement wasn't valid, and the woman's actions could breach the existing custody terms. The fact that the ex handed the dog to her thinking she was just visiting, and then she left without returning, might be seen as deceitful. Even if she believed she was in the right, the method of taking the dog without prior agreement could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the author felt manipulated and decided to act. But bypassing the legal system and taking the dog by surprise could lead to legal repercussions. The ex might sue for interference with custody or something similar. The woman's actions, while possibly motivated by caring for the dog, might still be illegal if they violate the custody arrangement, even if the ex was uncooperative.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is the legal owner, but joint custody requires cooperation. Taking the dog without the ex's consent, even if she's the legal owner, might be against the custody agreement. Therefore, she could be in the wrong because she didn't follow proper legal procedures and acted unilaterally, which might have legal consequences. The answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
