I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody issue between an ex-boyfriend and the author. They had joint custody, the dog is legally the author's, and they had a verbal agreement for the dog to move to NYC once the author was settled. But now the ex won't let the dog go, so the author flew across the country and took the dog back without telling him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author says the dog is legally theirs. In California, if the dog is the author's property, the ex can't just keep it without legal grounds. But they had a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they're hard to prove. However, since it's joint custody, maybe they had some arrangement in place. The ex might be within his rights if the joint custody was formalized in some way, even if it's not a court order. But the author mentions it's \"joint custody\" but the dog is \"legally mine on paper.\" So the ownership is clear, but custody terms are usually more about shared care. If the ex is refusing to follow the verbal agreement, the author might have the right to take the dog back, especially if they can prove the verbal agreement. But in many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be challenged in court, so the author could be in a legal bind if the ex disputes it.\n\nNext, the author took the dog without telling the ex, which is where the ethical question comes in. Even if the author is legally right, taking the dog without notice could be considered unethical or even a form of theft if done without consent. The ex might have felt that since they were moving in together, the dog's custody would be split in a way that benefits the dog, but the author is asserting their legal ownership. The ex's concern about the dog's quality of life in NYC versus having a backyard and another dog there is a common argument in pet custody disputes. Courts usually consider the best interest of the pet, but if the author is the legal owner, they might have the upper hand. However, the ex might argue that the environment in NYC is not suitable, but that's up to the court to decide.\n\nThe author also mentions that the ex called five times and they didn't answer. This could be seen as avoiding confrontation, but maybe the ex is trying to resolve it through communication. The author might have acted impulsively, which could be seen as wrong if there were other legal avenues available. Instead of taking the dog without notice, the author could have tried to negotiate again or consulted with a lawyer to get a court order. Taking the dog secretly could lead to legal repercussions if the ex files a complaint for theft or unauthorized taking.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while the author might believe they are doing the right thing for their dog, using deception or taking the matter into their own hands without following proper legal procedures could be seen as wrong. The ex might have a valid claim if they can prove they had a custody agreement. However, since the dog is legally the author's, maybe the ex isn't entitled to long-term custody unless it was part of a formal agreement. The author's decision to fly across the country to take the dog might be justified legally, but the method of doing it without informing the ex could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is there. The author feels bad for splitting the dog from another companion but insists it's their dog. The ex might have a strong emotional bond too. The key here is whether the ex had any legal right to the dog's custody. If the original agreement was verbal and the ex isn't following it, the author might have the right to enforce it, but perhaps through legal means. Taking the dog without notice could be seen as a breach of the agreement if the ex is arguing that the author agreed to some terms that now aren't being honored.\n\nIn summary, the author might be legally in the right because the dog is their property, but ethically or in terms of relationship conduct, taking the dog without notice could be seen as wrong. The answer likely depends on whether there's a formal custody agreement. If not, the author might have a stronger legal case, but the method of taking the dog without communication could still lead to negative consequences. So, the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) if the ex had a legitimate claim or if the author didn't follow proper procedures, or B (not in the wrong) if the ex was breaching the verbal agreement and the author is asserting their legal ownership. Since the ex might not have legal custody, maybe the author is in the right. But the act of taking the dog without notice and not communicating could still be problematic, leading to potential legal issues if the ex disputes it. The answer is a bit nuanced, but given the options, I think the author is in the wrong because they took the dog without prior arrangement, even if the ex was in the wrong initially. So, the answer is A.\n"
