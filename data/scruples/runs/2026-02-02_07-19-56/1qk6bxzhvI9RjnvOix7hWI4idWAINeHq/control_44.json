I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author and ex had joint custody. The dog is legally the author's, and they paid for vaccinations. They moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement to bring the dog there. But the ex changed his mind, saying the dog would be better in California. The author tried to argue but eventually gave in, realized the ex was manipulating, and decided to fly back to take the dog without telling him. The ex handed the dog over thinking the author was just visiting, but the author kept her. Now the ex is upset, and the author is worried about legal issues.\n\nSo the key points here: legal ownership, verbal agreement, unauthorized taking of the dog. In California (and probably other states), having a verbal agreement might not hold up in court. The ex might have visitation rights even if the dog is legally the author's. Taking the dog without consent could be considered theft or a breach of custody agreement. The author could face legal consequences. Even though the dog is legally theirs, the ex might have a claim for joint custody or visitation. The author's actions, while driven by concern for the dog's well-being, may not be legally justified. Also, the ex might have the right to visitation under joint custody, even if the dog is the author's. So, the author taking the dog without following proper legal procedures could be in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
