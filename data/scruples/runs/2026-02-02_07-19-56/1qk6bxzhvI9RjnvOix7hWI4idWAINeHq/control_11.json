I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog custody dispute between an ex-boyfriend and the author. They had joint custody, and after moving to NYC, the ex refused to let the author bring the dog. The author then flew to California and took the dog without the ex's knowledge, leading to the current situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that they legally own the dog on paper and have paid for vaccinations. In California, pet custody can be tricky, but if the dog is legally the author's, they might have a stronger claim. However, joint custody agreements typically require cooperation. The ex might have had visitation rights, but if the author is the legal owner, taking the dog could be justified if the ex was not following the agreement.\n\nHowever, taking the dog without the ex's knowledge might be problematic. Even if the author has legal ownership, abducting the dog without proper legal process could lead to issues. Courts usually prefer resolving disputes through legal channels rather than unilateral actions. The author's action might be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which could be against the terms of their agreement, even if the agreement was verbal.\n\nThe ex's refusal to let the dog move could be considered a breach of the verbal agreement, but verbal agreements can be hard to enforce. The author might argue that the ex was violating the agreement by not allowing the dog to move, but without a written agreement, it's harder to prove. The author's legal ownership might help, but the method of retrieving the dog could still be an issue.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels they were left with no choice, and friends supported them, suggesting the ex might have been manipulative. But legally, the right approach would be to seek court intervention. Taking the dog without notice might be seen as an illegal taking, even if the ex was in the wrong. The ex could potentially argue that the author broke the agreement and is now in breach, leading to possible legal consequences.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have had a valid reason based on legal ownership, the method of taking the dog without legal process or notice could make them at fault. Courts typically require proper procedures, so the author's actions, though understandable, might be legally questionable."
