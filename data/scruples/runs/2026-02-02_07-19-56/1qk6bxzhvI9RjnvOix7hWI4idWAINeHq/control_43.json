I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they did the right thing by taking their dog back from their ex-boyfriend. They mention joint custody for two years, but legally the dog is theirs. They paid for vaccinations and had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC when they settled there. But the ex refused, and after arguments, the user decided to fly to California and take the dog without telling the ex, then sent an email and didn't answer calls. Now they're worried the ex might take them to court.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The user says they legally own the dog. In California, if the dog is legally theirs, then under law, the ex doesn't have the right to keep the dog. However, joint custody agreements, even verbal ones, might be tricky. But since it's a verbal agreement, it's hard to enforce. So the user might have a legal right to take the dog, but the ex could still try to challenge it in court, especially if there were agreements made. However, if the legal ownership is clear, the user is probably in the right.\n\nEmotionally, the user is struggling. They feel they had no choice, and the ex might be upset. The ex's reasons for not wanting the dog in NYC are about quality of life, but the user argues the dog would be fine. The user's friends think the ex was manipulating, which is a red flag.\n\nEthically, taking the dog without notice could be seen as wrong because it disrupts the ex's life and the dog's routine. However, if the user has legal ownership and the ex is being unreasonable, then maybe it's justified. The user did contact after taking the dog, which shows some consideration, but not answering calls could make things worse.\n\nPossible legal consequences: While the user has legal ownership, the method of taking the dog (stealing without notice) might be seen as contempt or violating any custody agreements. If there was a verbal agreement, that might not hold up, but if the ex was withholding the dog despite legal ownership, the user might have a case.\n\nIn summary, the user is in a tough spot. Legally, they might not be in the wrong if they own the dog, but the method of taking it without notice could lead to legal issues. Ethically, it's a gray area, but the ex's manipulation might justify the action. The answer likely leans towards the user not being in the wrong (B), but there are nuances.\n"
