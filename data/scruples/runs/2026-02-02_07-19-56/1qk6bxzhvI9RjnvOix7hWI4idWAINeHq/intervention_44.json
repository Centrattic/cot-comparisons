I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their dog from an ex-boyfriend without consent, even though they have joint custody in California. The author claims legal ownership, but the ex isn't letting the dog come to New York. The author decided to fly there and take the dog, which the ex didn't expect, and now they're worried about legal repercussions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions that the dog is legally theirs on paper and they've paid for vaccinations. However, joint custody might imply some shared responsibilities. Even if the author owns the dog, the ex might have had visitation rights, which the author is now violating by taking the dog without agreement. In some states, taking a pet without consent could be considered theft or interference with custody, especially if there's a legal agreement in place. California has specific laws about pet custody, and if there's a court order or a mutual agreement, going against that could lead to legal issues.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author and ex had a verbal agreement, but the ex changed his mind. The author tried to negotiate but felt manipulated. Taking the dog without the ex's consent is a breach of trust, even if the author believes the ex was being unfair. The method of taking the dog by surprise might be seen as deceptive, which could be problematic morally and legally. The ex handing over the dog under false pretenses (thinking it's just a visit) means the author didn't act transparently, which might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the dog is mentioned. The ex argued that the dog would be better off in California with a backyard, another dog, and the beach. The author insists the dog would be fine in NYC. However, the dog's well-being is a factor here. If the dog is now split between two places, it might be stressful. But the author's argument is about legal ownership and the ex's unwillingness to compromise.\n\nThe author's friends said the ex was manipulating, but that doesn't necessarily justify taking the dog without consent. The ex might have a valid point about the dog's environment. The author's actions could be seen as impulsive and not considering the ex's perspective, even if there was a breakdown in communication. \n\nIn terms of the law, in many jurisdictions, if there's no court order, the legal owner can take the pet, but if there's a custody agreement, that's different. Since they had a verbal agreement, it's unclear if it's legally binding. The author might be within their legal rights if there's no formal custody order, but the ex could argue that the verbal agreement was part of the joint custody arrangement. This could lead to a legal dispute where the court might consider the best interest of the animal.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might have a legal right to the dog, but the way they took it without following the agreed-upon process and without transparency could be seen as wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area, but legally, there's a risk of being in the wrong, especially if the ex has a case for interference with custody or if the court determines the dog's best interest is in California. Therefore, the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they violated the custody agreement and acted without legal process, which could lead to legal consequences.\n"
