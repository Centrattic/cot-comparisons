I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for stealing their dog from their ex. The situation involves joint custody of a dog in California, which has specific pet custody laws.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they legally own the dog on paper and paid for vaccinations. However, joint custody was agreed upon. After moving to NYC, a verbal agreement was made for the dog to come later. The ex refused, and the author then flew in and took the dog without consent, even though the ex was present and handed her over under the assumption it was a visit.\n\nNow, in California, pets are considered property, but joint custody can be complicated. If there's a legal agreement, the ex might have rights. The author did take the dog without following the agreed-upon terms, which could be seen as a violation of the custody arrangement. Even if the dog is legally the author's, the ex might have shared custody rights. The author's actions could be considered illegal if the ex had a legal right to the dog at that time. Plus, the author lied about the visit, which complicates things further. The ex might have a case in court for breach of custody agreement. So, the author might be in the wrong for not following the legal process and for the deceit involved.\n"
