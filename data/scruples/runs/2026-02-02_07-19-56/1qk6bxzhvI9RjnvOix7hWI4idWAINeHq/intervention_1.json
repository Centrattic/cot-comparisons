I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog custody dispute between an ex-boyfriend and the writer.\n\nFirst, the key facts: They had joint custody, the writer legally owns the dog, they had a verbal agreement for the dog to move to NYC once settled. The ex changed his mind, the writer flew to California to take the dog without telling him, leading to the ex potentially taking legal action. \n\nSo, the writer took the dog without consent. Even though they legally own the dog, the ex had joint custody. In custody agreements, both parties have rights. By taking the dog without communication, the writer might have breached the custody agreement, which could be considered a violation of the legal terms, regardless of ownership. \n\nEven if the writer felt manipulated, using force or stealth to take the dog could be seen as wrong. The ex might argue that the writer didn't follow the agreed-upon arrangement. Also, joint custody usually requires cooperation, and taking unilateral action could disrupt that. \n\nHowever, the writer's argument is that they are the legal owner and the ex was being unreasonable. But legal ownership doesn't necessarily override custody agreements in cases where joint arrangements are in place. The writer might have needed to go through legal channels to resolve the dispute instead of taking the dog themselves. \n\nSo, even though the writer might have a point about the ex not compromising, their actions of taking the dog without consent could be considered wrong, leading to potential legal issues. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
