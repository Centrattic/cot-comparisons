I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a dog back from an ex boyfriend in California after moving to NYC. Both had joint custody, but the author legally owns the dog. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once the author was settled. However, the ex changed his mind, leading the author to take the dog without telling him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that the dog is legally theirs on paper. In California, dog ownership laws can be tricky, but if the author has a legal document stating ownership, that's a strong point. However, joint custody arrangements might require some form of agreement, even if it's verbal. But since the ex is refusing to comply with the verbal agreement, is the author justified in taking the dog?\n\nThen there's the issue of the method. The author flew across the country to take the dog without informing the ex. The ex gave the dog to the author under the assumption that it was a temporary visit. The author then lied about the dog's return. This seems like a breach of trust and could be seen as deceptive. Even if the author believes they are justified, taking the dog without following proper legal procedures could lead to complications. \n\nThe ex might feel that the author is violating the custody agreement. Even if the author legally owns the dog, the ex might have had some rights to custody, especially if it was part of their joint agreement. The author's actions, while possibly motivated by the dog's well-being, could be seen as reckless and potentially illegal if they didn't follow the proper legal channels. \n\nAlso, the ex might have legal recourse here. If the ex takes the author to court, the court might consider whether the author acted within the bounds of the law and the custody agreement. The fact that the author didn't go through legal means but instead took the dog might be a negative point in court. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them. The ex might be using the dog as a way to control the situation, which is a red flag. The author might have felt they had no choice, but the method used could still be problematic. \n\nSo, the key points are legal ownership versus custody, the method of taking the dog, and the potential consequences of not following legal procedures. The author might be in the right in terms of ownership but not in the right in how they took the dog. The answer likely is A (the author is in the wrong) because even if they own the dog, the way they took it without proper legal steps and by deceiving the ex could be seen as problematic.\n"
