I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after stealing their dog from their ex. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the dog is legally theirs, and they mention paying for vaccinations. In California, pet ownership can be tricky, but if the dog is in their name, they have legal rights. But joint custody agreements might complicate things. The ex had agreed to a verbal arrangement where the dog was supposed to move to NYC once the user settled. The ex then reneged, leading the user to take the dog without consent.\n\nEthically, the user had a verbal agreement, which might not hold up legally. But the ex's change of heart could be seen as unfair. The user felt manipulated and decided to take the dog, which is a strong move. However, taking the dog without notice might be seen as extreme. They did send an email after arriving, so maybe they tried to communicate.\n\nThe ex might take legal action. Even if the dog is legally theirs, taking it without notice could lead to complications. The user's friends thought the ex was manipulative, which adds context. But the ex might argue breach of their custody agreement. \n\nIn the end, the user acted to assert their legal ownership but in a way that could be seen as confrontational. The answer might depend on the specific state laws and the enforceability of the verbal agreement. But generally, taking the dog without a court order or agreement might be the user's fault legally, even if they feel wronged. So the answer is A.\n"
