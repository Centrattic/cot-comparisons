I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stealing their own dog from the ex-boyfriend. They have a joint custody agreement in California, but the author legally owns the dog. After moving to NYC, they tried to get the dog but the ex refused. The author then flew to take the dog without telling the ex, who thought they were just visiting. Now the author is worried about being taken to court.\n\nFirst, the legal ownership is on the author's side. But joint custody might mean they had a shared agreement. The ex might be in the wrong for not returning the dog as agreed, but the author took the dog without notice. Even though the author owns the dog, using force or deception to retrieve it could be problematic. Stealing your own property is a bit of a gray area. If the ex was violating the agreement, the author might have a case, but the method used might not be the best. Maybe they should have gone through legal channels to enforce custody instead of taking it secretly. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulative, but the author's actions could be seen as trespassing or theft, depending on local laws. California law might have specific rules about pet custody. Even if the author is right about ownership, the way they took the dog could lead to legal issues. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong for the method used, even if the legal ownership is theirs.\n"
