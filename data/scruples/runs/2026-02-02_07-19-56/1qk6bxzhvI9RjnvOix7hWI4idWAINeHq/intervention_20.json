I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they and their ex-boyfriend have a dog they've had joint custody of for two years. The author legally owns the dog and paid for vaccinations. They split custody every two weeks, buying their own food and toys. Then the author moved to NYC, and they had a verbal agreement that the dog would move there once the author was settled, and they'd work out an arrangement later.\n\nBut when the author was ready, the ex said the dog wouldn't come to NYC. The ex's reasoning was that the dog's quality of life is better in California with a backyard, another dog companion, and the beach, implying NYC is a \"concrete jungle.\" The author argued it would be fine but eventually gave in, but after realizing their friends thought the ex was manipulating, they decided to fly to California and take the dog without the ex knowing. The ex handed the dog over thinking it was a visit, but the author took her to NYC. They sent an email at the airport and the ex called multiple times, but the author didn't answer. Now the author is worried about the ex taking them to court and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the author legally owns the dog. So, in theory, they have the right to take their dog back. However, the ex had custody under a verbal agreement. In California, there might be specific laws about pet custody and relocation. If there's a verbal agreement, but the ex is now refusing to let the dog move, does that matter legally? Verbal agreements can be tricky because they might not hold up in court if there's no written documentation. The author might have a legal claim to the dog, but breaking the verbal agreement by taking it without discussion could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The author took the dog without the ex's knowledge, which is a form of deception. Even though the dog is their legal property, stealing it might not be the right approach. The ex might have felt that the dog was part of their life and not just an object. The author's friends said the ex was manipulating, but taking the dog secretly could be seen as the author being manipulative too.\n\nThe ex might have a valid concern about the dog's well-being, given the environment change. But if the author is the legal owner, maybe they can still take the dog, but should they have to do it secretly and against the agreed terms? The author's actions could be seen as breaking the agreement they made, which might be why the ex is upset. Also, the author mentions the ex \"trapped\" them, but maybe the ex was just following their own convictions about the dog's welfare.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might have a case, but ethically, taking the dog without any discussion or negotiation could be wrong. The ex might have the right to contest the move if it affects the dog's well-being, but the author's secret retrieval could lead to legal issues even if they own the dog. The key points are the verbal agreement, the ex's potential legal rights if they have a custody arrangement, and the method of taking the dog (deception). Therefore, the author is in the wrong for violating the verbal agreement and using underhanded tactics to get their dog, regardless of legal ownership.\n"
