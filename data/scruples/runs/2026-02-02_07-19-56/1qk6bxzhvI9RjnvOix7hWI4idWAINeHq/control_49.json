I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a dog custody issue after a breakup. The author and their ex had joint custody for two years in California. The author legally owns the dog and has paid for her vaccinations. They broke up a year ago but continued sharing custody every two weeks. Then the author moved to NYC, and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would come there once the author was settled. But the ex refused to let the dog move, saying it's better for the dog to stay in California with a backyard and another dog. The author tried to negotiate but felt manipulated, so they flew to California to take the dog without the ex's knowledge, pretending to just visit. The ex handed her over thinking the author would return her, but the author didn't. Now the author is worried about the ex taking them to court.\n\nSo, first, the legal aspect. The author says the dog is legally theirs on paper. In California, pet custody is typically handled as property, so the legal owner has rights. However, joint custody agreements can have terms. The ex might have been following the verbal agreement, but if the author is the legal owner, maybe they can take the dog back. But did they have a court order or a formal agreement? The post mentions a verbal agreement, which might not hold up in court. Also, taking the dog without consent could be seen as theft, even if it's your own pet. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author felt manipulated and decided to take drastic action. They admit to lying to the ex about their intentions. Even if the ex was being unreasonable, stealing the dog under false pretenses is questionable. However, the author's argument is that the dog's well-being might be better with them, but the ex had a different view. Without a legal resolution, the author took matters into their own hands. \n\nThe ex might have a case for theft or breaking the verbal agreement. The author's actions could lead to legal trouble. Even if the dog is legally theirs, the method of retrieval might not be justified. Also, the author acknowledges feeling guilty and heartbroken, which suggests they know it's a morally complex situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might be in the right as the owner, but their method of retrieval could be problematic. Ethically, it's a gray area. However, since they used deception and possibly broke the law (theft from the ex), even if the ex was wrong, the author's actions might be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong)."
