I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for stealing their dog from their ex. The situation involves joint custody in California, where the author legally owns the dog. They moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come once they were settled. The ex refused to let the dog move, so the author flew to California and took the dog without telling the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author says the dog is legally theirs on paper. If that's the case, under California law, owning a pet can be considered personal property. However, joint custody agreements can complicate things. Even if the author is the legal owner, the ex might have had a right to possession under the custody agreement. Taking the dog without consent might be considered theft, even from a former partner.\n\nThen there's the verbal agreement part. Verbal agreements are legally binding but can be hard to enforce without evidence. If there was a verbal agreement that the dog would move, but the ex broke it, that might affect things. But the ex might argue that circumstances changed (like the dog's quality of life), so maybe the agreement was never valid. \n\nThe ex's reasoning about the dog's environment\u2014I know NYC apartments can make for a hard life for some pets, but the author might argue that the dog can adapt. However, the ex's refusal could be seen as a violation of their previous arrangement. \n\nThe author took the dog without informing the ex, which could be seen as theft or at least a breach of the custody agreement. Even if the author had the right to reclaim the dog, doing it secretly might not be the best approach. The ex might have grounds for legal action if there was a custody agreement in place. \n\nAlso, the author's friends said the ex was manipulating them. That's possible and could indicate bad faith from the ex. But the author's actions, while perhaps done out of love for the dog, still involved deception and possibly illegal action. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the right legally if the dog is their property and the custody agreement was not legally binding. But if there was a legal custody agreement with terms, the author might be breaching that. However, since the ex was not willing to comply with the verbal agreement, the author might have a case. But the method of taking the dog without consent is problematic. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the legal ownership versus custody. If the author is the legal owner, they might have the right to reclaim the dog, but doing so without following the proper legal channels could still be wrong. The ex might retaliate legally. So maybe the author is not entirely wrong, but their method was questionable. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Legally, maybe they are not, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, in jurisdictions, taking property without consent is theft, so the answer might be A. But the user might be in California where pet custody laws are more nuanced. Wait, California recently passed a law regarding pets as companions, not just property, so maybe the courts would consider the best interest. But the author took matters into their own hands, which might not be advisable. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because even if they have legal ownership, the method of taking the dog without following the agreed-upon process might be illegal. So the answer might be A.\n"
