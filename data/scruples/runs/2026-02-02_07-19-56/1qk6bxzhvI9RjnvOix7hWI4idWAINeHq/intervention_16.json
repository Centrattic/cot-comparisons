I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute between the author and their ex-boyfriend. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, they had joint custody for two years in California. The author legally owns the dog and has paid for all the vaccinations. After breaking up, they agreed on a 2-week rotation. When the author moved to NYC, they had a verbal agreement that the dog would come to them once settled. However, the ex changed his mind, saying the dog would stay in California for her quality of life. The author tried to argue but eventually gave in, but friends said the ex was manipulating them. So the author flew to California, took the dog without the ex's knowledge, and sent him an email. The ex hasn't heard from them in five days, and the author is worried about legal issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the legal ownership and the method used to retrieve the dog. The author legally owns the dog, so they have a right to possession. However, the ex had joint custody, and there might be a court-ordered custody arrangement. Even if the author is the legal owner, taking the dog without going through the proper legal channels could be problematic. \n\nTaking the dog by surprise, without the ex's consent, might be considered a violation of the custody agreement. Even if the author believed the ex was being manipulative, the correct course of action would be to seek legal recourse rather than taking matters into their own hands. Also, the fact that the ex handed the dog over under the assumption the author was just visiting could be a point in their favor, but the act of stealing the dog still might be unethical and possibly illegal. \n\nIn terms of the law, in California, both parents (or custodians) have rights under joint custody. If the author's ex was following the custody schedule, then taking the dog without notice could breach that agreement. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of the custody arrangement, even if they are the legal owner. \n\nAdditionally, the emotional aspect: the author feels it was necessary because they believe they had no choice, but using force or stealth could be seen as wrong regardless of their intentions. \n\nSo, considering all these points, even though the author is the legal owner, the method used to retrieve the dog might be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
