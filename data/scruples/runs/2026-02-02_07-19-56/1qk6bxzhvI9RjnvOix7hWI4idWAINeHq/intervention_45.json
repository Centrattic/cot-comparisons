I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. So the situation is about a dog custody dispute between an ex couple. They had joint custody for two years, and the woman owns the dog legally. Then she moved to NYC, and they had a verbal agreement that the dog would come with her once settled. But the ex refused to let the dog move, so she flew back and took the dog without telling him, leading to potential legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The woman legally owns the dog, so she has the right to the dog. However, they had a joint custody arrangement. Even if she's the legal owner, joint custody might require cooperation. Taking the dog without the ex's consent, even if it's her dog, might be considered a violation of the custody agreement. Stealing is a strong term here\u2014taking something from someone else, even if you own it, without their consent could be problematic.\n\nBut then, there's the part where the ex wasn't willing to compromise. The woman felt trapped and that her ex was manipulating her. She says her friends say he was controlling. She did try to negotiate but eventually gave in, then decided to take the dog. So she used deception\u2014told the ex she was just visiting but took the dog instead. That's a breach of trust.\n\nLegally, in California, the state where the ex is, they have specific laws about animal custody. The woman might have a legal right to the dog, but the way she took it could lead to legal issues. The ex might claim that the joint custody agreement was in place, and taking the dog without agreement could be seen as violating the terms. Even though the dog is legally hers, the method of retrieval could be problematic. Also, the emotional aspect\u2014splitting the dog from the ex's other dog might be a factor, but that's more about the ex's situation.\n\nThe user's question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer depends on legal rights versus the manner in which she took the dog. Legally, she might be in the right as the owner, but the act of taking the dog without consent and through deception is ethically questionable. Legally, if there's a custody agreement in place, she might need to follow that process. Stealing, even one's own property, in this context could be seen as wrong because it disrupts the agreed-upon arrangement and might involve trespassing or theft charges.\n\nSo, considering the legal and ethical angles, the answer is likely A\u2014she is in the wrong because she violated the custody agreement and used deceptive means to take the dog, even if she had legal ownership. The ex might have grounds to take her to court for breaching the custody terms, regardless of ownership. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
