I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for stealing their own dog from an ex in California. The situation involves joint custody, legal ownership, and a relocation to NYC.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they legally own the dog. So, technically, they have the legal right. But they had a verbal agreement with the ex to move the dog to NYC once settled. The ex refused, thinking the dog would be better in California with a backyard and another dog. The author tried to negotiate but eventually gave in, realized they were being manipulated, and then went to take the dog without the ex's knowledge, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the law. In California, joint custody agreements usually require both parties to have shared responsibilities. Since the dog is part of a custody arrangement, taking the dog without the ex's consent might be a legal issue even if the author is the legal owner. Verbal agreements aren't always enforceable in court, so if the ex sees this as a breach, maybe they can argue that the author didn't follow the agreed terms. But the author felt forced and that the ex was being controlling. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. The author had a legal claim but broke the verbal agreement. However, the ex might not have followed through on the initial plan. The author's action could be seen as self-protective, but stealing is a strong term. Maybe taking the dog without notice disrupts the custody agreement, which could be seen as wrong regardless of ownership. Also, the ex might now seek legal action, which the author is worried about.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the verbal agreement was binding and the state's animal custody laws. California might prioritize joint custody even if one person is the legal owner. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not following the custody agreement, even if they own the dog. But if the ex was violating the agreement by refusing to allow the move, maybe the author had grounds. However, the method of taking the dog without informing the ex could be problematic. So, I lean towards A (yes, in the wrong) because of the custody arrangement and the way the dog was taken.\n"
