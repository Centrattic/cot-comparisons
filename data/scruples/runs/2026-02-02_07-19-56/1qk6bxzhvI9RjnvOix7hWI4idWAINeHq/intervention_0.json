I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took their dog back from an ex without permission is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation involves joint custody, but the author legally owns the dog. The ex wasn't willing to let the dog come to NYC, so the author decided to fly to California and take the dog without telling the ex. They mentioned the dog is their legal property, but they might have broken the verbal agreement by taking her without consent.\n\nFirst, legal ownership is key here. Even though they had a verbal agreement, the author's legal right to the dog stands. However, using force or deception (like pretending to visit and then taking the dog) might be problematic. The ex might feel betrayed, even if the author has legal rights.\n\nAlso, the method of taking the dog\u2014without notice, during a visit\u2014could be seen as underhanded. The ex might feel like the author broke trust, which could lead to legal issues despite the legal ownership. The author's actions could be considered a breach of the mutual agreement they had, even if the ex wasn't upholding it properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt manipulated and had friends back them up. They might believe they had no better options. But maybe there were legal steps they could have taken instead of taking the dog themselves. Resorting to self-help without legal recourse might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, while the author has a legal claim, the way they handled it could be wrong. They might have acted impulsively and caused more harm to their relationship and potentially opened themselves to legal action from the ex. The answer is likely A (in the wrong) because of the manner in which they took the dog, despite legal ownership.\n"
