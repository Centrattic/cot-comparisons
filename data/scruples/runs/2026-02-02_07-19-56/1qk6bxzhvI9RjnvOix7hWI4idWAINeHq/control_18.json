I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody issue between an ex and the author.\n\nSo the key points here: The author and their ex had joint custody of the dog in California. The author now moved to NYC and wanted the dog to come there, but the ex refused. The author then flew back to California and took the dog without the ex's knowledge, sending an email and ignoring his calls afterward. The author legally owns the dog on paper and paid for all the vaccinations. The ex is upset and might take legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the author is the legal owner, they have the right to the dog. However, joint custody agreements usually require both parties to cooperate. The ex might have agreed verbally to the dog moving to NYC, but that's not a legal contract. The author taking the dog without the ex's consent, even if legally justified, could be seen as acting unilaterally, which might not be the best approach. Also, the ex might have a claim if there was a court order for joint custody. But the story doesn't mention a court order, just a verbal agreement. \n\nEthically, the author felt they were left with no choice because the ex was being inflexible. The ex argued that the dog's quality of life would be better in California. The author's action was a breach of trust, which could complicate any legal proceedings. Even if the author has legal rights, taking the dog without notice might be seen as reckless and could lead to legal consequences, especially if the ex feels wronged. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have tried to resolve the issue through legal means, like mediation or a court order, instead of taking matters into their own hands. By doing so, they might be setting a precedent that the ex could exploit later. The author's actions, while motivated by their belief in their rights, could be viewed as impulsive and not considering the ex's perspective, even if the ex's behavior was manipulative. \n\nSo, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong (A) because they bypassed legal processes and acted unilaterally, which could lead to legal trouble even if they are the legal owner. However, the nuance is that the ex's behavior might have contributed to the situation. But the main issue is the method used to retrieve the dog without due process.\n"
