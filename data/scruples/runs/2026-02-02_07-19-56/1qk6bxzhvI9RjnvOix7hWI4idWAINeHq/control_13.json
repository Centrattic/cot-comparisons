I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stealing their own dog from their ex. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex had joint custody of the dog for two years in California. The author legally owns the dog and paid for vaccinations. They broke up but continued to share custody every two weeks. Then the author moved to NYC, and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would move there once the author was settled. But when the time came, the ex refused, saying the dog's quality of life would be better in California with a backyard and another dog. The author tried negotiating but couldn't reach a compromise. Friends said the ex was manipulating them, so the author flew to California, got the dog without the ex knowing, and took her to NYC. The ex was called, and now the author is worried about legal issues.\n\nSo, the main points here are legal ownership versus actual custody. The author owns the dog legally, but they had a joint custody arrangement. When moving, the ex refused to allow the dog to come to NYC, leading the author to take matters into their own hands. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLegally, if the author is the legal owner, they have the right to possession of the dog. However, the ex had custody during the joint arrangement. If the ex was following the custody schedule, then taking the dog without notice might be problematic. But since the ex is refusing to allow the dog to move, maybe the author is within their rights to retrieve their dog. However, the method of taking the dog without informing the ex might be an issue. In custody disputes, even for pets, courts might look at how the custody is handled. The verbal agreement might not be legally binding, so the ex could argue that the author is not following the original custody arrangement. The author's actions might be seen as taking the dog in a way that disrupts the agreed-upon custody, even if they're the legal owner.\n\nAlso, the ex might have a claim if they had a valid custody agreement or if the author didn't follow proper legal procedures. Since the author didn't go through the courts to modify custody and instead took the dog without notice, that could be seen as wrongdoing. Courts usually require proper legal processes to resolve custody disputes to avoid escalation and ensure both parties' rights are respected. So even if the author has legal ownership, the method of retrieval might be problematic, making them at least partially at fault.\n\nSo the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't follow legal procedures and disrupted the custody arrangement, even if they have legal ownership. Alternatively, B could be argued if legal ownership supersedes the custody issue. But since they had a joint custody agreement, taking the dog without the ex's consent could be a violation of that agreement, even if the author is the legal owner. So the author may be in the wrong for not following the established custody terms and for not using legal channels to resolve the dispute.\n"
