I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody dispute between the author and their ex-boyfriend. They had joint custody for two years, and the author legally owns the dog. After moving to NYC, the ex refused to let the dog come with them, even though there was a verbal agreement. The author then flew to California to \"steal back\" their dog, taking her without the ex's knowledge, even though the ex had agreed to let her visit but expected her to return. The author is now worried about legal repercussions and being seen as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the author legally owns the dog, they have the right to possession. However, they had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once the author was settled. The ex broke that verbal agreement, which might be a problem. But the author then took matters into their own hands by taking the dog without going through legal channels. \n\nIn many places, including California, pet custody can be complicated. Even if you own the pet, joint custody arrangements might be legally binding if they were agreed upon, especially if they were part of a court order. But in this case, it seems the custody was a verbal agreement, not a legal one. So the author might have a legal right to the dog, but the ex's refusal to comply could be a breach of that agreement.\n\nHowever, the author's method of taking the dog\u2014without the ex's knowledge and while the ex was under the impression it was just a visit\u2014could be seen as deceptive. Even if the author believed the ex was wrong, taking the dog in that manner might be considered illegal if it's considered trespassing or theft of property. The ex could potentially sue for damages or seek a court order.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is there. The author feels it was necessary because the ex was manipulating them, and friends supported the action. But intentionally deceiving the ex and taking the dog without consent might not be the best approach, even if the ex is at fault. The author could have tried to resolve the dispute through legal means instead of taking action unilaterally.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's actions might also be questionable. If the verbal agreement was part of their joint custody, and the ex is now refusing to honor it, that's a problem. But the ex might argue that the dog's well-being is better in California, which is a valid concern. However, without a legal agreement, the ex can't legally prevent the owner from taking the dog.\n\nSo, the key points are: legal ownership, verbal agreement, and the method of retrieval. The author might have the legal right to take the dog, but the way they did it\u2014deceptively\u2014could be problematic. The ex's actions might be considered a breach of the verbal agreement, but that doesn't justify the author's method. The author should have pursued legal action first. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for taking the dog without going through proper legal channels, even if the ex was in the wrong by breaking the agreement.\n"
