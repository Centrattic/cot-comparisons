I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute between the author and their ex-boyfriend in California. The author moved to New York and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come with them once settled. However, the ex changed his mind, and the author decided to fly back to California to take the dog without informing the ex, leading to the current conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that the dog is legally theirs on paper and they've paid for all the vaccinations. They had joint custody for two years. In California, pet custody can be tricky. Legally, pets are considered property, but courts might consider the best interest of the animal. The author has a legal claim, but the ex's refusal to comply with the verbal agreement might be a problem. However, the author taking the dog without consent could lead to legal issues, even if they are the legal owner. The ex might claim theft or interference with property.\n\nNext, the moral and ethical side. The author felt cornered and that the dog's well-being was at risk in NYC. The ex argued the dog would be unhappy there. The author's actions were based on their belief that the dog's quality of life is better with them, but taking the dog without consent could be seen as extreme. The ex was hand-raising the dog, and the separation might be traumatic for both the dog and the ex. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulating, but the ex's actions might be justified if he believed the dog's well-being is at risk.\n\nJoint custody agreements typically require cooperation. The breakdown here shows that the verbal agreement wasn't sufficient, and the ex is now withholding the dog. The author's decision to take matters into their own hands might be a legal risk. Even if the dog is legally theirs, taking the dog without legal process could be problematic. The ex could potentially take legal action, like filing a lawsuit for conversion or something similar.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The author feels guilty but believes they had no choice. The ex is upset and might be considering legal steps. The author's actions, while driven by concern for the dog, could be seen as violating the ex's rights or agreed-upon shared custody. Even if the author is the legal owner, the ex's role in the dog's life is significant, and the abrupt removal could be traumatic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a legal claim, the method of taking the dog without consent is likely to be viewed negatively in a court of law. The situation highlights the need for legal representation and following proper procedures for custody disputes. The author might not be entirely in the wrong legally since they are the owner, but the manner in which they took the dog could lead to legal consequences, making them partially at fault. The ethical dilemma is complex, but legally, the author's actions could be seen as a breach of the ex's custodial rights, even if joint. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
