I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about a dog custody issue between an ex-couple in California. The author, now in NYC, took the dog from their ex without consent. They had a verbal agreement, but the ex changed his mind. The author claims legal ownership and tried to get the dog back, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the key points: joint custody was arranged informally, the author legally owns the dog, the ex refused to let the dog move to NYC, and the author took the dog without permission. The ex might have legal recourse since the author took the dog without a court order or mutual agreement.\n\nIn California, even if you own a pet, courts often look at joint custody agreements. The author's action might be seen as unlawful taking, especially if there was a prior arrangement. The ex might argue that the verbal agreement isn't enforceable and that the courts had a say. The author's friends said the ex was manipulating, but that's subjective. Taking the dog without consent could lead to legal trouble, like being charged with unlawful detention or violating custody orders if any exist.\n\nSo, while the author feels wronged, their actions (stealing the dog) might be legally wrong. The ex could take them to court, and the courts might side with the ex if there's a history of joint custody. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
