I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog custody dispute after a breakup. The author flew to California to take their dog back from their ex without the ex's knowledge, even though they had a verbal agreement. The author legally owns the dog, but the ex didn't let the dog move to NYC. The author took the dog without telling the ex, which led to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions were wrong. Legally, the author owns the dog, so maybe they have a right to take it. But they had a verbal agreement that the dog would move once the author was settled. The ex didn't follow through, so the author took matters into their own hands. \n\nBut taking the dog without consent could be seen as theft, even if it's their own pet. In some places, taking a pet without the other person's consent might lead to legal issues, even if you own the pet. The author admits to \"stealing\" the dog, which is a strong word. However, they mention the ex was resistant and maybe manipulative. \n\nThe key points are the legal ownership, the verbal agreement, and the method of retrieval. Since they had joint custody, there might be a need for a legal agreement rather than a verbal one. The author might not have gone through the proper legal channels, which could make their actions problematic. Even if they were acting out of what they thought was right, bypassing the court system could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the author is worried about the ex taking them to court. That suggests there might be a legal risk involved. Even if the author owns the dog, the way they took it could be contested. So, while the author might have had a legitimate reason, the method they used might not be legally sound. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex might have been violating the verbal agreement by not allowing the dog to move. But the author could have taken it to court instead of taking the dog themselves. So, the author's actions might be morally justified in their eyes, but legally questionable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they took the dog without following proper legal procedures, which could lead to legal issues even if the dog is theirs. The right approach would have been to seek legal intervention instead of self-help.\n"
