I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking their dog from their ex without consent. The story says they had joint custody but the dog is legally theirs. They moved to New York, and there was a verbal agreement for the dog to come later. The ex refused to let the dog come, so the author went to California and took the dog without telling them, claiming it was under the pretense of a visit.\n\nFirst, legal ownership is a key point here. If the dog is legally the author's, then they have the right to take possession, especially if there's a custody agreement. However, joint custody might involve some shared responsibilities, but if the ex was refusing to comply with the verbal agreement, the author might be justified in asserting their legal ownership.\n\nBut wait, the ex had the dog in their care. Even if the dog is legally the author's, if the custody arrangement allowed the ex to have the dog during certain periods, taking the dog without notice could violate that agreement. The author might need to follow proper legal procedures for custody disputes rather than taking matters into their own hands. However, since the ex was allegedly being manipulative and not willing to cooperate, the author might feel they had no choice. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author tried to reach out after taking the dog and the ex hasn't responded yet might indicate that the ex is upset but hasn't taken legal action yet. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them, which could add to the justification. Still, the act of taking the dog without consent could be seen as a civil issue. \n\nIn legal terms, if the ex had possession under a custody agreement, the author might need to enforce the agreement through the court system rather than physically taking the dog. However, if the agreement was verbal and the ex was refusing to honor it, the author might have a case. But the method of taking the dog without notice could lead to legal complications. \n\nSo, considering that the author is the legal owner but the ex had custody rights, the situation is a bit of a gray area. The author might be justified in enforcing their legal ownership, but the method could be problematic. However, since the ex was allegedly non-cooperative, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But the act of taking the dog without following proper legal channels could make them partly responsible. \n\nHmm, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because taking the dog without notice could disrupt the custody agreement, even if the author is the legal owner. But there's also the aspect of the ex being manipulative. I'm a bit torn, but since the author had legal ownership, maybe not entirely in the wrong. But the method of taking the dog without following the court might be an issue. So maybe B (not in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure.\n"
