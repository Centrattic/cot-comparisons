I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dog from their ex without consent.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had joint custody of a dog they legally own. After a breakup, they moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement to bring the dog there. The ex refused, thinking it's better for the dog to stay in California. The author tried to negotiate but felt manipulated, so they flew to California and took the dog without the ex knowing, then informed them via email. The ex called multiple times, but the author didn't answer. Now they're worried about being taken to court.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The dog is legally the author's, so they have ownership rights. However, joint custody was an agreement. The problem is how they took the dog. Abducting the dog without legal process could be problematic even if they own it. Verbal agreements aren't always enforceable, so maybe the ex wasn't legally obligated to send the dog. The author might have a valid reason for ownership, but taking the dog without notice could be seen as violating the custody agreement. If there was a court order or formal agreement, then the author might be justified. But since it's joint custody with a verbal agreement, maybe the ex had the right to keep the dog under that. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, even if they own the dog. Also, the method of taking the dog (without informing the ex) could lead to legal consequences. The author might need to check if there's a legal custody arrangement in place. If there isn't, maybe they can claim ownership, but the sudden removal could still be an issue. So, while the author has legal ownership, the way they took the dog might be against their custody agreement. Therefore, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't follow proper legal procedures even if they own the dog.\n"
