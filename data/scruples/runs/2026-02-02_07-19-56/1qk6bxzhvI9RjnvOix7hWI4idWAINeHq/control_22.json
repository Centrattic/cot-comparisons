I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody issue between an ex-partner and the person who posted.\n\nFirst, the key points: They had joint custody, the dog is legally owned by the poster, and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once the poster was settled. The ex refused to honor this, leading the poster to fly to California and take the dog without informing the ex, who agreed to let her go under the belief it was a temporary visit. The ex then called repeatedly after the poster left, and the poster hasn't responded, leading to fears of legal action.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: The dog is legally the poster's, so they have the right to possession. However, joint custody agreements, even verbal, might be tricky in court without written proof. The poster's action might be seen as necessary to reclaim their property, but taking the dog without notice could be considered a breach of the existing arrangement, even if verbal.\n\nEthically, the poster felt they had no choice due to the ex's manipulation. Friends supported that view, suggesting the ex was being controlling. However, the ex might argue the verbal agreement wasn't binding and the poster's sudden move disrupted the dog's life.\n\nThe poster's actions could lead to legal complications because the ex might claim they were following the custody agreement. The poster's decision to take the dog without notice might be seen as overstepping, even if the dog is legally theirs. But given the ex's refusal to compromise and the verbal agreement, the poster might have a valid reason to reclaim the dog.\n\nIn legal terms, if the poster can prove the verbal agreement, they might be in the right. However, without evidence, the ex could argue the poster broke the agreement. The answer hinges on whether the verbal agreement is enforceable and if the poster's actions were justified under the circumstances. Since the poster owns the dog, they have a stronger legal position, but the method of taking the dog could be problematic. So, while the poster might have a legal right, their actions could be seen as ethically questionable if they disregarded the ex's role in the custody agreement.\n"
