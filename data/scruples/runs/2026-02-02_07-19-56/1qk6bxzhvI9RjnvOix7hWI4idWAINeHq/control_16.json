I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a dog custody dispute between an ex-couple in California. The author, now in NYC, had a verbal agreement to get the dog once settled. But the ex changed his mind, and the author decided to fly to California to take the dog without telling him, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that the dog is legally theirs on paper, and they paid for all the vaccinations. In California, the legal ownership of a pet is usually determined by who is on the pet's documentation, like the license or registration. If the author is the legal owner, then they might have the right to take the dog, but joint custody agreements can get complicated, especially after a breakup.\n\nBut here's the catch: even if the author is the legal owner, taking the dog without the other person's consent might be considered theft, especially if the ex is in possession of the dog as part of a custody agreement. The author had a verbal agreement, but verbal agreements can be hard to enforce legally. The ex might argue that the custody arrangement was part of their agreement, even if it was verbal, and taking the dog without notice could be seen as breaching that.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they had a joint custody arrangement for two years. After moving to NYC, they had a verbal agreement that the dog would move there once settled. But when the time came, the ex changed his mind. The author tried to argue, but when that didn't work, they decided to take the dog without the ex's knowledge. This could be seen as acting without respecting the ex's current wishes, even if the author believes the ex is being controlling.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author might have the right to the dog but might have gone about it the wrong way. Instead of taking the dog without notice, they should have gone through legal channels, like a court, to resolve the custody dispute. Taking the dog without notice could lead to legal issues like unlawful taking or even criminal charges if the ex feels his property (custody rights) was violated.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels they had no choice and that the dog's well-being is better in NYC. However, the ex might have valid points about the dog's quality of life in a city versus a house with a backyard and another dog. The author's actions, while possibly motivated by their belief in what's best for the dog, could be seen as unlawful if they didn't follow proper procedures.\n\nIn summary, even if the author is the legal owner, the method of taking the dog without the ex's consent might be considered wrong. The correct approach would be to resolve the dispute through legal means rather than taking matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not following the proper legal process, even if their intention was to reclaim their legal property.\n"
