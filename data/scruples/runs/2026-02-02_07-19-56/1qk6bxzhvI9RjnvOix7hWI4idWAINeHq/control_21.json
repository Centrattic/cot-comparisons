I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for stealing their dog from their ex. The situation involves joint custody of a dog after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they legally own the dog and that they have joint custody. They moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement for the dog to come with them. The ex broke the agreement, so the author decided to take the dog without the ex's consent, even though they had a verbal agreement that the ex would return her.\n\nNow, the key points here are legal ownership and the verbal agreement. Since the dog is legally the author's, they have a right to possession. The ex had joint custody, which is typically a shared responsibility. The problem is that the ex is not following through with the agreed-upon arrangement. The author tried to communicate and compromise but felt manipulated. Taking the dog without consent, even if it's their property, might be legally justified, but it's a gray area.\n\nHowever, theft of a pet is a legal issue. Even if you own the pet, taking it without permission from someone who has custody could be considered a crime. In some states, animal theft is a felony. Plus, the author admits they took the dog without the ex's knowledge, which might be seen as a trespassing or theft. The ex could potentially take them to court for violating the custody agreement, even if the author is the legal owner. \n\nAlso, the author's actions might be seen as extreme. Instead of taking the dog without consent, they could have pursued legal action first to modify the custody arrangement or enforce the verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be hard to enforce, so maybe the ex is using the verbal agreement to avoid returning the dog, and the author should have gone through legal channels.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the ex is in breach of the verbal agreement and is denying them access to their legally owned pet. The emotional aspect is clear, but legally, taking the dog without due process might not be the best approach. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a legal claim to the dog, their method of taking it might be problematic. They could be in the wrong for not following proper legal procedures, even if their intent was to claim their property. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
