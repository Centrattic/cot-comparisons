I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves stealing their own dog from an ex-boyfriend after a breakup, under a joint custody arrangement. The dog is legally owned by the author, and they moved to NYC, expecting the dog to come with them. The ex refused, and the author took the dog without telling him, leading to the ex's anger and possible legal action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author says they own the dog legally. In California, pet custody can be a bit tricky, but if the dog is legally their property, then the ex might not have a legal claim unless there's a court order. However, the original joint custody was a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be hard to enforce, but if they were in place for a year, maybe there's a pattern that could be considered. But the author's main point is that the dog is theirs on paper. So maybe they have a legal right to retrieve their pet.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The ex had been taking care of the dog for some time, and now the author is taking the dog without consent. The ex might feel betrayed, especially if they were under the impression that the dog was staying with him. The author's friends said the ex was manipulating, which adds a layer of emotional control. The author might have felt like their options were limited, but taking the dog without notice could be seen as a breach of trust, even if legally justified.\n\nJoint custody usually implies shared responsibility. The author and ex had been managing it, but after the move, the ex changed the agreement. The author tried to negotiate but the ex wouldn't budge. The author's action of taking the dog might be understandable if they believe the ex was being unreasonable. However, the method of doing so without informing the ex, despite a verbal agreement, could be problematic. The ex might have felt entitled to some say in the matter, even if the legal ownership is clear.\n\nAlso, the ex's reasoning about the dog's quality of life in NYC versus California. If the ex is genuinely concerned about the dog's well-being, maybe there's a valid point there. But the author's friends think it's manipulation. It's possible that the ex was using the dog's welfare as an excuse to control the situation.\n\nIn terms of legal ownership, if the author has the legal documents, the ex can't legally keep the dog from them. But the situation might involve emotional distress. The author might have broken the ex's trust, and even if they're right legally, the ethical side is about respecting the previous agreement and communication. The author could have tried legal channels instead of taking matters into their own hands, which might have been a better approach to avoid conflict.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, maybe. They had a verbal agreement but didn't follow through with communication. However, the ex's refusal to compromise and possible manipulation might tip the balance. The answer might depend on whether the ex had any legal rights established in court. Since the original custody was verbal and the dog is legally the author's, the author might have a point. But taking the dog without notice and during a custody arrangement transition could be seen as wrong because it disrupts the agreed-upon routine and might cause stress to the ex. The author's actions, while possibly justified legally, could be considered rude or unethical in the context of their relationship.\n"
