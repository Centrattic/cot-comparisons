I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for stealing their own dog from their ex. They had joint custody, but they legally own the dog. The ex wouldn't let the dog come to New York, so the person flew there and took the dog without telling the ex. The ex might take them to court.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The user says they own the dog on paper. In California, even if there's joint custody, the legal owner's rights are still valid. So if the ex is refusing to follow the agreed-upon arrangement, maybe the user could have gone to court to settle it. But taking the dog without the ex's consent? That's probably illegal. Even if it's your dog, taking it by force or deception could lead to legal issues like theft or kidnapping, especially since the ex had custody rights at the time.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The ex might feel manipulated or disrespected. The user admits to manipulating the ex's trust by making him think they were just visiting. That's underhanded. Even if the user believes it's for the dog's best interest, the method was deceitful. The dog's well-being is a valid concern, but there are proper legal channels to resolve custody disputes. Bypassing those could be seen as wrong.\n\nAlso, the user's friends said the ex was controlling, but that doesn't justify illegal actions. If there was a history of manipulation, maybe the user should have documented the verbal agreement or sought legal clarification earlier. Now, the ex might indeed take legal action, which the user is aware of.\n\nSo, even though the user's intention might be to do what's best for the dog, the method they used\u2014stealing without legal recourse\u2014makes them at fault. The answer is A.\n"
