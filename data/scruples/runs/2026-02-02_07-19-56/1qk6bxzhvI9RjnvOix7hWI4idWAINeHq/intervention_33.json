I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute between an ex-boyfriend and the author after they broke up.\n\nFirst, the author mentions joint custody for two years, with the dog legally owned by the author. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once the author was settled. But the ex changed his mind, and the author decided to fly across the country to take the dog without the ex's knowledge, leading to the ex's anger and possible legal actions.\n\nSo, the main points here are legal ownership, the verbal agreement, and the method of retrieving the dog. Since the author legally owns the dog, they have legal rights. However, the ex had joint custody, so there might be shared responsibility. But the key issue is the enforcement of the custody arrangement. The author's action involved deception\u2014telling the ex they were just visiting and taking the dog without consent. Even though the author believed the ex was being controlling, taking the dog under false pretenses could be problematic. \n\nIn a legal sense, even if you own the pet, taking it without following the agreed-upon custody terms could lead to complications. The ex might argue that the author violated the custody agreement. While the legal ownership is with the author, joint custody arrangements typically require cooperation. The author's method of taking the dog\u2014without proper discussion, using deception\u2014might be seen as wrong, even if the underlying issue was about the ex not honoring the agreement.\n\nAlso, the author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. The right approach would have been to seek legal clarification or mediation rather than taking the dog secretly. The author might have had a valid reason but chose a questionable method. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong because of the deceptive action, despite legal ownership. But I need to make sure about the nuances of pet custody laws. In California, pets are considered property, so the owner can claim them, but joint custody agreements can complicate things. If there's a written agreement, that's one thing, but a verbal agreement might be less enforceable. The author's action could be seen as necessary to reclaim their property, but the method (deception) might still be problematic. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the way they took the dog, even if the ex was being difficult.\n"
