I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute after a breakup. The key points here are joint custody, legal ownership, and the method used to retrieve the dog.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they legally own the dog and paid for her vaccinations. However, they had a joint custody arrangement. Even though they own the dog, joint custody typically means both parties have rights. The ex moving to NYC and the verbal agreement about the dog coming later might complicate things. The author felt they had to take the dog without the ex's consent, which led to the current conflict.\n\nNow, legaly, if they have joint custody, both parties might have the right to the dog's company. Taking the dog without the other's consent could be considered a breach of that agreement. Even if the author owns the dog, the custody arrangement might require some cooperation. The ex might have a case for interference with custody. Plus, stealing the dog, even if it's your own pet, is a civil wrong and could result in legal action. The author might have to face consequences like returning the dog or paying damages.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's refusal to compromise could be seen as problematic. However, the method the author used\u2014theft\u2014is where the legal issue lies. The author could have sought legal recourse instead of taking matters into their own hands. So, while the ex's actions might be morally questionable, the author's illegal act of taking the dog without consent likely makes them the one in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated the custody agreement and used inappropriate means to take the dog, which is a legal issue.\n"
