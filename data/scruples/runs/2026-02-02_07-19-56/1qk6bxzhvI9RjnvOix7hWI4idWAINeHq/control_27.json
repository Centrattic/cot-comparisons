I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking back a dog from an ex boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the dog is legally owned by the author, so they have a right to the dog. The ex had joint custody, but the author moved to NYC. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would come later. But the ex changed his mind, saying the dog would be better in California with a backyard and another dog. The author tried to argue but felt manipulated and decided to take the dog without telling him, then left a message. Now they're worried he might take them to court.\n\nIn California, joint custody of a pet usually means both parties have agreed-upon visitation rights. Even if the author is the legal owner, taking the dog without notice could disrupt the custody agreement. The ex might have a case for violating the custody arrangement, especially if there were prior agreements. Also, the author flew across the country, which is a significant action. But the ex isn't the legal owner, so the author might have the right to reclaim the dog. However, the method of taking it might be an issue. It's possible that the ex is upset because of the sudden action, even if the author is legally justified. The answer likely depends on the specific custody terms and the jurisdiction. California courts might consider both the legal ownership and the agreed-upon arrangements. If the ex was breaching the agreement by refusing to allow the dog to move, the author might have a point, but the stealth action could still be problematic. So maybe the author is not in the wrong (B) because they're the legal owner, but they might have handled it poorly, which complicates things.\n"
