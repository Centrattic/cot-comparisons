I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for taking their dog from their ex without his knowledge. The situation involves joint custody, legal ownership, and some emotional aspects.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that the dog is legally their property, and they've paid for all the vaccinations. California law regarding pet custody isn't as clear as child custody, but generally, pets are considered property. However, joint custody agreements can exist. The ex had agreed to a verbal arrangement that the dog would move to NYC once the author was settled. Now, the ex is refusing, which might be a breach of that agreement. But verbal agreements can be hard to enforce in court. \n\nThe author decided to take the dog without the ex's knowledge. Even though the dog is their legal property, taking it without agreement might lead to legal issues. The ex could argue that he was following the custody arrangement, and the author's actions could be seen as interfering with the agreed-upon terms. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels they had no choice, and friends think the ex was manipulating. But from a legal standpoint, the author might be at risk of being seen as violating the custody agreement, even if the ex wasn't adhering to the verbal terms. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might be justified if the ex was being unreasonable. However, the method of taking the dog without notice could be problematic. The ex might have a case if he claims he was following the agreement and the author broke it. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether a verbal agreement is enforceable and whether taking the dog without notice violates the custody arrangement. Legally, the author might be in the wrong if they breached the agreement. But if the ex wasn't following the terms, there's a gray area. Still, the author's actions could lead to legal repercussions, making them at fault.\n"
