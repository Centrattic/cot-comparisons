I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog custody dispute between an ex-boyfriend and the author. They had joint custody in California, and after moving to NYC, the author tried to get the dog but the ex refused. The author then flew back to California and took the dog without the ex's knowledge, leading to a possible conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that the dog is legally theirs on paper and that they paid for all vaccinations. However, joint custody agreements usually require cooperation between both parties. Even if the author is the legal owner, the ex had a say in the arrangement. Taking the dog without consent might be a violation of the custody agreement, even if the ex was being unreasonable. Stealing the dog, even if it's one's own, could lead to legal repercussions like theft or violating custody terms.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author had a verbal agreement, but when things broke down, they resorted to taking the dog without the ex's knowledge. This could be seen as a breach of trust and possibly manipulative behavior from the ex, but the author's action of taking the dog without consent might not be justified. The ex might argue that the author is disregarding their part of the agreement and the dog's well-being, as the ex wanted to keep her in a better environment. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulating, but that doesn't make the author's action right. \n\nAlso, the fact that the ex called multiple times and the author didn't answer might indicate a lack of communication, which is a red flag. The author could have tried to resolve it legally instead of taking the dog. The emotional aspect is there, but legally and ethically, the author might be in the wrong for not following the proper channels. Even if the ex was being difficult, stealing the dog could lead to legal action, so the author's actions might not be the right approach despite their intentions.\n"
