I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog custody dispute between an ex and the author. They had a joint custody arrangement, but the author moved to NYC and wanted to bring the dog there. The ex refused, so the author flew to California to take the dog without informing the ex properly, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author says the dog is legally theirs on paper. In California, pet custody laws can vary, but generally, pets are considered property. So even if they had a joint custody agreement, the legal ownership might still be with the author. However, joint custody agreements can sometimes be recognized if they're part of a court order or mutual agreement. The story mentions a verbal agreement, which might not hold up in court as well as written agreements. But the author did have a verbal agreement that the dog would move with them when they settled. The ex breaking that could be a breach of their mutual understanding, even if it's verbal.\n\nThen there's the act of taking the dog without informing the ex. The author claims they were given the dog to take but the ex didn't know the plan. The author sent an email after arriving at the airport and didn't answer calls. This could be seen as breaking the ex's trust, even if the author believes the ex was being manipulative. The author's actions might be seen as deceptive because they didn't tell the ex upfront, leading to the ex feeling betrayed.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to do what they think is best for the dog, considering their own living situation. The ex argues the dog's quality of life in NYC is worse, but the author might have valid points too, like being able to visit more often from NYC. However, the method of taking the dog without proper communication could be problematic. Even if the author is in the right legally, the way they handled it could cause further conflict and legal issues.\n\nThe ex might retaliate by taking the author to court, which the author is worried about. Legally, the author might have a case, but the lack of proper legal steps, like court orders, could weaken their position. The verbal agreement isn't as strong as a written one, so the ex could argue that there's no binding agreement. Plus, taking the dog without notice might be seen as a breach of any informal agreement they had.\n\nThe author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them, but that's subjective. The author's actions could be viewed as taking matters into their own hands instead of seeking legal resolution. Even if they feel wronged, the best approach would be to go through legal channels to enforce the custody arrangement.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, while the author might have had a legitimate grievance, the method of taking the dog without proper legal recourse and without clear communication could make them at fault. They might be in the wrong because of the deceptive tactics and not following through with proper legal steps. However, if the verbal agreement was considered part of the joint custody, the author could have a stronger case. But since they didn't take legal action and instead acted unilaterally, it's more likely they're in the wrong.\n"
