I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stealing their dog back from their ex. The situation is that they had joint custody, the author legally owns the dog, and after moving to NYC, the ex refused to let the dog come. The author then flew to California and took the dog without the ex's knowledge, though the ex handed her over thinking it was a visit.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The author owns the dog legally. In California, they might have joint custody, which typically requires both parties to agree on the dog's care. But since the author is the legal owner, maybe they have more rights. However, taking the dog without the ex's consent could be seen as a violation of the custody agreement. Even if the author feels the ex isn't following through, abducting the dog might be considered a breach of the agreement, which could lead to legal issues. The ex might have a case for interfering with custody.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the author is stressed. They felt manipulated and had no choice. But taking the dog without proper legal action might be seen as impulsive. The ex did hand over the dog initially, thinking it was a visit, which complicates things. The author's actions could be seen as dishonest, even if they believed it was for the dog's best interest.\n\nThe ex might retaliate legally, especially if there's a custody agreement in place. The author's decision to not answer calls could be seen as avoiding confrontation or legal responsibility. While the author's intent was to get their dog back in their legal ownership, the method might be problematic. They should have possibly gone through legal channels rather than taking it themselves.\n\nSo, legally, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow the custody agreement process. Ethically, it's a gray area, but the method used could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
