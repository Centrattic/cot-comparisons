I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody dispute between an ex and the author. They had joint custody for two years in California. The author legally owns the dog, paid for all the vaccinations, and they had an arrangement where they took turns every two weeks. The author moved to NYC and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would move there once settled. But when the time came, the ex refused to let the dog come, even after arguments. The author felt manipulated and decided to fly over, take the dog without the ex knowing, and the ex gave her up thinking the author was just visiting. Now the author is worried about being in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect is important. The author legally owns the dog, so in theory, they have the right to take the dog back. But they had a joint custody agreement. Even if the author owns the dog, joint custody might mean some shared responsibilities. The ex might argue that the arrangement was part of their agreement, so taking the dog without discussing could breach that. But since the author's ex was refusing to honor the verbal agreement, maybe the author felt it was necessary.\n\nBut the method of taking the dog might be the issue. Even if the author is legally the owner, taking the dog without the ex's consent could be seen as theft or illegal taking. The ex might take them to court for that. The author tricked the ex into thinking they were just visiting, which is a bit underhanded. Even if the author's intention was to get the dog back, the method might be problematic.\n\nAlso, in California, they have specific laws about pet custody. Even if one person owns the pet, the court might consider the best interest of the animal. The ex's argument about the dog's quality of life in NYC versus California could be a factor. If the court sides with the ex, the author could be in trouble. Plus, the verbal agreement might not hold up in court if it's not written.\n\nSo, the author might have a legal claim, but the way they took the dog could put them in a bad legal position. The ex could argue that the author breached the custody agreement and committed theft. The author's friends said the ex was manipulative, but that doesn't necessarily justify the illegal action. The author might end up in court, and the court could rule against them for the manner in which the dog was taken, even if the author is the legal owner.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author proves that the ex was not fulfilling the joint custody agreement and the verbal agreement, maybe the court would side with them. But the author's actions could be seen as escalatory and not following the proper legal channels. Instead of taking the dog, they should have gone to court to modify the custody agreement if the ex was refusing.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author's intent was to get their dog back, the method involved deceit and possibly illegal activity, which could make them the one in the wrong legally. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
