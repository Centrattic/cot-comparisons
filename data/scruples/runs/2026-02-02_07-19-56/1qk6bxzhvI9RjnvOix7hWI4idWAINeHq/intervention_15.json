I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about a person who flew across the country to take their dog back from their ex-boyfriend. They had joint custody, but the dog is legally theirs. The ex wasn't willing to let the dog move to NYC, so the author decided to take her without telling the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The dog is legally owned by the author, so maybe they have a right to take it back. But joint custody might mean they both have some rights. Even if the dog is legally theirs, how does custody work in such cases? In California, animal custody can be tricky. Sometimes it's based on who owns the dog, but sometimes courts consider the best interest of the animal. If the ex was involved in joint custody, maybe there's a process they should have followed instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThen there's the method they used. Taking the dog without the ex's knowledge could be seen as theft or kidnapping, even if it's their own dog. The ex might have a claim if they believed they had custody rights, especially if they were taking care of the dog and it was part of their arrangement. The fact that the author tricked the ex into handing over the dog when they thought it was just a visit might complicate things legally. The ex could argue that the author violated the custody agreement by not cooperating and instead using deception.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels guilty for splitting the dog from the ex's dog companion and the environment the dog was used to. But the author also feels manipulated by the ex and that the ex is trying to control them. The friends' input suggests the ex might be manipulating, which could be a red flag. However, the author's actions might have exacerbated the situation, leading to potential legal trouble.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if the author believes they're acting in the dog's best interest, the method of taking the dog without legal recourse or negotiation could be considered wrong. There might be legal steps they could have taken, like mediation or going to court to settle the custody issue. Resorting to theft, even of one's own pet, might be legally and ethically questionable. The ex could retaliate by taking the author to court, as the author mentioned. So, while the author might have a legal claim to the dog, their actions might have crossed a line in terms of legality and ethics.\n"
