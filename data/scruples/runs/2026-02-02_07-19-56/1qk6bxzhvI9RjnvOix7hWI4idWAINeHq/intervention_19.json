I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves taking back their dog from an ex after a breakup, which complicates things emotionally and legally.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The user mentions that the dog is legally theirs on paper and that they've paid for all the vaccinations. They had a verbal agreement for the dog to move to NYC once they were settled. But the ex didn't follow through, leading the author to take the dog back without consent. Even if the author feels it's their dog, taking it without the ex's agreement could be a problem in court. Verbal agreements might not hold up, especially in custody disputes. The ex might argue that since they had joint custody, the author can't just take the dog away like property. Plus, California and New York have different laws; the author moving the dog across state lines could trigger jurisdictional issues.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author felt manipulated and wanted the dog in NYC for their own reasons, but the ex argued for the dog's well-being in California. The author's friends thought the ex was controlling, but that's a separate issue. The act of taking the dog without consent is a gray area. While the ex might be inconsiderate, the author's method of resolving it could lead to legal consequences. The author mentioned the ex might take them to court, which is a real possibility. Even if the author has legal ownership, the manner in which they took the dog could be seen as contempt of court if there was a custody agreement in place.\n\nAlso, the story is in California, which has specific laws about pet custody. California treats pets as property, so even if there's a custody arrangement, the owner can potentially take the pet. But the author's actions might still be viewed as breaking the agreement, especially if the ex had possession under the verbal arrangement. The fact that the author had to \"steal\" the dog back without informing the ex could be problematic. The ex might have claims of harassment or unauthorized taking of property, which could lead to legal action.\n\nIn summary, while the author might believe they have legal ownership, the method of taking the dog without following proper legal procedures could make them complicit in wrongdoing. The situation is complex, and the answer likely depends on the specific laws in their states and any existing court orders. The author's actions, though motivated by their belief in ownership, may still be legally questionable.\n"
