I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong here. So, the main situation is about a dog custody issue between an ex-boyfriend and the poster. They had joint custody for two years in California. The poster legally owns the dog, paid for all the vaccinations, and they had a system where they took turns every two weeks. Then the poster moved to NYC and there was a verbal agreement that the dog would come with them once settled, but the ex didn't let the dog move. The poster tried to argue but the ex wouldn't compromise, so the poster decided to fly to California and take the dog without the ex's knowledge, only to hand her back but the ex didn't know the plan. Then the poster sent an email and didn't answer calls.\n\nFirst, the poster is in California, where the initial custody agreement was. They had a verbal agreement about moving the dog to NYC, but the ex reneged on that. The poster tried to negotiate but felt manipulated. So they took the dog without the ex's consent. Now, the question is whether this is the right move.\n\nLegally, the poster owns the dog, so perhaps they have the right to reclaim it. But joint custody might mean both parties have rights. In California, pet custody is often determined based on the best interest of the animal. The ex might argue that the dog's quality of life is better in California, so the court might consider that. However, the poster legally owns the dog, so maybe that gives them more standing. But the ex was part of joint custody, so taking the dog without going through legal channels could be problematic. The poster didn't go to court; they just took the dog, which could be seen as theft. Even if it's their dog, taking it without proper legal process might be illegal. The ex might have a claim for interference with custody. Also, the poster tricked the ex into thinking they were just visiting, which is deceitful. Even if the ex is manipulative, the poster's actions might be wrong because they didn't use the legal system. So, maybe the poster is in the wrong because they acted outside the law, even if they had a legal claim. Alternatively, if the ex was violating the verbal agreement, maybe the poster had to act. But verbal agreements can be hard to enforce. So, the answer might be A (the poster is in the wrong) because they took the dog without legal process, which could be illegal, and their method was deceptive.\n"
