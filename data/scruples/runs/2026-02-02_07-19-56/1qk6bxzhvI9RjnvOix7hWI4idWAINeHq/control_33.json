I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog custody issue after a breakup. The ex and the author had a joint custody agreement for two years in California. The author owns the dog legally and paid for all vaccinations. They moved apart, with the author moving to NYC. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would come to NYC once the author was settled, but the ex refused, claiming the dog would be unhappy in NYC. The author, after arguments, decided to fly to California and take the dog without telling the ex, who handed her over thinking it was a visit. The author then left, didn't answer calls, and is worried about legal consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In California, pet custody laws can vary, but generally, pets are considered property. However, joint custody agreements can be part of a divorce or separation if the couple is married. Since they're not married (just an ex boyfriend), the legal ownership is on the author's side. But the ex was part of the joint custody arrangement. The author's actions might be seen as taking the dog without the ex's consent, which could be a problem even if the ex thought they were just visiting.\n\nNext, the verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be tricky in court. The ex might argue that the agreement wasn't formalized and that they were following their own interpretation. The author tried to negotiate but felt manipulated, leading to the decision to take the dog. But even if the ex was being manipulative, the author could have sought legal advice instead of taking the dog secretly. \n\nEmotional aspects: The author is upset about separating the dog from the ex, but they also feel the ex is controlling. Friends say the ex is manipulating. However, the ex might have a genuine concern for the dog's well-being, especially if they have a backyard and another dog. The author's move to NYC might affect the dog's quality of life, but the author believes they can provide a good environment. The key point is that the author took the dog without the ex's consent, which is a legal issue even if the ex thought they had it. \n\nPotential consequences: The ex could try to take the dog to court. While the author might be the legal owner, the method of taking the dog could affect the case. Courts might consider whether the author acted in the dog's best interest but also if they violated any agreements or court orders. If there was no formal custody agreement in place after the move, the author might have the legal right, but the way it was handled could be seen as dishonest or deceitful. \n\nSo, the author is legally correct in owning the dog, but the manner in which they retrieved it without the ex's knowledge, especially when the ex was handling the dog, could be problematic. The ex might claim the author violated their agreement or committed some form of theft, even if it's their own pet. It's a gray area, but the author's actions, while possibly driven by the dog's best interest, might be seen as unethical or inconsiderate, especially if the ex was trying to follow what they thought was the agreement. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) for not handling it legally and ethically, leading to a possible court case and the ex's distress.\n"
