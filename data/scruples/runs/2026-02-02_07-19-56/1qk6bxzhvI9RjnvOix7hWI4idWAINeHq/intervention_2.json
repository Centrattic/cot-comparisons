I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dog custody issue after a breakup. The user moved to New York and had a verbal agreement that the dog would come with them once settled. But the ex decided not to let the dog move, and the author took the dog without the ex's knowledge, even though they had a handover that was supposed to be temporary. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The author says they legally own the dog. In California, which is a no-fault divorce state, pet custody can be tricky, but if the author is the legal owner, they might have more rights. However, joint custody agreements, even verbal, can be complicated. But just because they own the dog doesn't necessarily mean they can take it without considering the custody arrangement.\n\nThe ex and author had a 2-year joint custody arrangement. After moving to NYC, a new verbal agreement was made that the dog would come once settled. The ex changed his mind, and the author felt they had no choice but to take the dog. The author's friends thought the ex was manipulating, but the ex claims the dog's well-being in NYC is worse. \n\nThe author took the dog without the ex's full knowledge, which might be a problem. Even if the author is the legal owner, taking the dog without following the custody agreement could be seen as breaking the agreement. Also, the ex might argue that the verbal agreement was part of their custody terms, and by not adhering to that, the author is acting unilaterally. \n\nBut the author mentions that the ex wasn't willing to compromise and that friends said the ex was trying to control them. The author's action could be seen as a last resort to protect their legal rights. However, taking the dog without proper legal steps (like court) might still be problematic. \n\nIn legal terms, if there's a custody arrangement, even if verbal, the owner might need to go through proper channels rather than taking the dog. The author could be at risk of legal action for breach of agreement or even theft. Also, taking the dog without notice could be considered a violation of the ex's custodial rights if the arrangement allowed him some time with the dog. \n\nSo, while the author might feel justified, legally and ethically, taking the dog without the ex's consent after a verbal agreement could be seen as wrong. The right approach would be to seek legal resolution rather than self-help. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
