I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog custody dispute between an ex and the author.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they have joint custody and that the dog is legally theirs. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once the author was settled. But the ex changed his mind, and the author decided to fly to California to take the dog back without telling the ex. The ex thought the author was just visiting. The author then left without the ex's knowledge and didn't answer the calls, feeling conflicted.\n\nNow, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The author says the dog is legally theirs, so maybe they have the right to take it back. But joint custody might mean both have some rights. However, taking the dog without the ex's consent could be problematic, even if the ex is an ex. The ex might have had visitation rights, and the author's actions could be seen as theft, even if it's their own dog.\n\nIn California, pet custody laws can vary. Some states treat pets like property, so taking the pet back might be legally justified if the author is the legal owner. But if joint custody was established through an agreement or court order, then taking the dog without consent could breach that agreement. The verbal agreement might not hold up in court, so the ex could have a case if he tries to sue.\n\nEthically, the author's actions might be seen as necessary to protect the dog's well-being, but the method is questionable. Stealing a pet, even if it's your own, is a gray area. The author might have felt manipulated, but breaking the law could lead to legal trouble. The ex might feel wronged and could take legal action, which would complicate things.\n\nThe key points are: legal ownership vs. joint custody, the nature of the custody agreement, and the method used to retrieve the dog. If the ex was supposed to have visitation or joint custody, the author's unilateral action might be against that agreement. Even if the dog is legally the author's, how they retrieved it matters. So, the author might be in the wrong legally if they violated an agreement, even if the intent was good.\n"
