I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for stealing their dog back from their ex. The situation involves joint custody, legal ownership, and some conflict over where the dog should live.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they legally own the dog on paper and have paid for her vaccinations. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would move to NYC once they were settled. The ex changed his mind, and the author decided to fly across the country to take the dog without informing the ex. The ex gave the dog to the author but thought they were just visiting and would return her. The author then left, didn't answer calls, and is worried about legal repercussions.\n\nSo, the main points here are legal ownership versus actual custody. The author is the legal owner, but they had a verbal agreement for joint custody. In many states, including California, verbal agreements for pet custody can be tricky. The laws might not be as clear as with children, so the ex might have had a right to the dog under their agreement, even if the author is the legal owner. \n\nTaking the dog without the ex's knowledge could be seen as a breach of their agreement. Even if the author felt manipulated, using illegal means to retrieve the dog might not be justified. The ex might have legal recourse, especially if the author violated any terms of their agreement. \n\nAlso, the author's actions could be considered theft since the ex was in possession of the dog under the verbal agreement. The fact that the ex handed the dog over under the assumption of a visit complicates things. If the author misrepresented their intentions, that could be problematic legally. \n\nHowever, the author's argument is that they are the legal owner and felt forced to act because the ex wasn't compromising. The emotional aspect is there too, but legally, the situation might lean towards the author being in the wrong for violating the custody agreement. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
