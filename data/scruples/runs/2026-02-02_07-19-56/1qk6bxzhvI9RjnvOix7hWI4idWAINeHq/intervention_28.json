I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for taking their dog from their ex without consent. The situation involves joint custody, legal ownership, and a verbal agreement.\n\nFirst, the author legally owns the dog. That's a key point. Even though they had a verbal agreement, which might not hold up in court, the ex is refusing to let the dog come to NYC. The author feels they have no choice but to take the dog, which they did. The ex handed the dog over thinking it was just a visit, but the author took her. \n\nNow, the main issue here is whether taking the dog without the ex's consent is legally or ethically wrong. Legally, since the author owns the dog, they have the right to take possession. But the joint custody arrangement complicates things. However, joint custody usually requires mutual agreement. If the ex is blocking the author's access despite the agreement, the author might have a case. \n\nEthically, though, stealing the dog could be seen as wrong because it disrupts the ex's relationship with the pet and may cause emotional distress. The author mentions feeling guilty about splitting them up. The ex might retaliate legally, but the author's argument is that they're protecting their legal rights.\n\nThe AITA community often considers both legal and ethical angles. Here, the author's actions are legally defensible but ethically questionable. However, the ex's refusal to compromise might have left the author with limited options. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the verbal agreement is enforceable. If there's no written agreement, the ex's refusal could be a breach, but the author's response is extreme. However, given the legal ownership, the author might not be the asshole. But the act of \"stealing\" is still a problem. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're asserting their legal right, but there's a nuance. The community often looks at intent and circumstances. The author had a valid reason but used a questionable method. However, in AITA terms, the wrongdoer is often the one who acted inconsiderately. Here, the author did what they felt was necessary to protect their rights. So, maybe B.\n"
