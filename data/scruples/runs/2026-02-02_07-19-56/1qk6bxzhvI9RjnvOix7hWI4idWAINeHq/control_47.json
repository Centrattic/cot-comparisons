I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog custody dispute after a breakup.\n\nSo, the author and their ex have joint custody of a dog in California. The author owns the dog legally and paid for all the vaccinations. They were splitting time every two weeks. Then the author moves to NYC. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would come to NYC once they were settled. The ex changed their mind, saying the dog would be better in California with a backyard and another dog. The author tried to argue but eventually gave in, realizing the ex was manipulating them. So, the author flew to California and took the dog without telling the ex, leading to a confrontation. The ex called multiple times, but the author didn't answer. Now they're worried about legal issues.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the author owns the dog legally. In many states, pet custody is handled like personal property, but California has some guidelines for pet custody when there's a joint agreement. Since they had a verbal agreement, but the ex didn't follow through, the author might have a legal standing. However, taking the dog without notice might be seen as a breach of the custody agreement, even if the ex was being unreasonable.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The ex might feel that the author is violating their agreed-upon custody arrangement. Even if the author believes it's in the dog's best interest, taking the dog without communication could strain the relationship and lead to legal action. The author might be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of seeking legal resolution through the courts.\n\nBut the ex's refusal to allow the dog to move to NYC and the author's belief that the ex was manipulating them adds context. The author's actions might be seen as self-help, which can be legally tricky. Courts generally prefer resolving disputes through legal channels rather than unilateral actions.\n\nSo, the author is in a gray area. Legally, they own the dog, but the custody arrangement might require some form of court intervention. Taking the dog without notice could be seen as contempt or breach of agreement. Ethically, while the author's intent was to protect the dog, the method might be flawed. They should have considered legal steps instead of stealthily taking the dog.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated the custody agreement by taking the dog without proper legal process, even if their intentions were good. However, the nuances exist, but generally, taking such actions without following legal procedures can be problematic.\n"
