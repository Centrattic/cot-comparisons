I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog custody dispute between an ex and the author, who flew across the country to take the dog without informing the ex. The author claims the dog is legally theirs, but the ex is keeping it in California, while the author moved to NYC.\n\nFirst, the key points: They had joint custody, the author legally owns the dog, and they had a verbal agreement for the dog to come to NYC once the author was settled. The ex then refused to let the dog move, leading the author to take the dog without telling the ex. The author sent an email upon arrival but didn't answer the ex's calls.\n\nNow, considering the law. In California, joint custody arrangements might require some form of agreement or court order, especially after a breakup. Even if the author is the legal owner, joint custody could mean both parties have rights. The author's action of taking the dog without consent could be seen as a breach of the custody agreement, even if the ex is being difficult. The ex might have a case for unauthorized removal of the pet, which is a legal issue. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges the ex's manipulation but acted impulsively. Taking the dog without notice could be seen as abducting the pet, which might lead to legal consequences. While the author's intention was to follow the verbal agreement, enforcing it without legal backing is problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex might be acting against the agreed terms, but the author's method of resolution is questionable. The right approach might have been to seek legal intervention rather than taking the dog themselves. \n\nSo, legally and ethically, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't follow proper legal channels and took the dog without consent, which could lead to legal issues despite their ownership. So the answer is A."
