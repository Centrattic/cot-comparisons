I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody dispute after a breakup. The person moved to NYC and had a verbal agreement to get the dog. The ex didn't want to send the dog, so the author went to California to take the dog without telling the ex, thinking the ex was manipulating them.\n\nFirst, there's the legal aspect. The author mentions the dog is legally theirs on paper, and they paid for vaccinations. But in California, joint custody agreements require both parties to have some rights. Even if they owned the dog, if there's a joint custody arrangement, taking the dog without the other person's knowledge might be an issue. The ex might have had visitation rights or some legal standing, so just taking the dog could be a violation of that agreement, regardless of ownership. \n\nThen there's the verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be tricky in court because they're hard to prove. The author relied on this agreement, but the ex changed his mind. The author felt cornered and decided to take matters into their own hands. But even if the ex was being unreasonable, the correct way would be to go through legal channels to modify the custody arrangement, not to take the dog without consent. \n\nThe author didn't answer the ex's calls after taking the dog, which might indicate they're avoiding conflict. The ex could potentially sue for wrongful taking of the dog, especially if the joint custody was still in place. Even if the author owns the dog, the ex might have had some custodial rights. \n\nAlso, the author's friends thought the ex was manipulating them. That's possible, but the author's actions still might not be justified. The right approach would be to seek legal advice, maybe file for a custody modification, rather than just taking the dog. The author's actions could be seen as theft or kidnapping of the pet, depending on the state laws. \n\nIn California, if the ex had joint custody, the author might need a court order to take the dog out of state. Flying with the dog without the ex's consent could be problematic. The ex might have the right to object to moving the dog to another state without agreement. \n\nSo even though the author feels they were left with no choice, the method they used to take the dog might be legally questionable. They should have gone through the legal system to resolve the dispute instead of taking the dog themselves. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
