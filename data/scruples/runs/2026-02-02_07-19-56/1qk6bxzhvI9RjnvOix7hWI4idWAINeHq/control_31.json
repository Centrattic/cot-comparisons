I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dog back from the ex-boyfriend without consent. They mentioned joint custody in California, but the dog is legally owned by the author. The ex wasn't willing to let the dog move to NYC, and the author ended up taking her without the ex's knowledge.\n\nFirst, legal ownership is a key point. If the author has legal ownership on paper, then they have the right to the dog. The ex might have had a verbal agreement, but that's not as strong as a legal document. However, joint custody agreements usually require cooperation. The author went behind the ex's back, which is a problem. Even if they own the dog, stealing it without notice could be seen as underhanded. \n\nBut wait, the author tried to resolve it through arguments and then with friends before taking action. The ex wasn't compromising. In that case, maybe the author felt forced. However, the proper legal step would be to go to court to settle disputes, not take matters into their own hands. So while the legal ownership is on the author's side, the method of retrieval might be questionable. \n\nAlso, the ex had been caring for the dog for a year, so there's a bond. The author's action might cause emotional distress to the ex. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author is the legal owner, maybe they aren't in the wrong, but the situation is messy. Alternatively, the ex might have a valid case for breach of the custody agreement if it was formalized. But since it's verbal, the author's actions could be justified. \n\nStill, taking something without notice, even if you own it, can be seen as a problem, especially if it's someone else's care. The answer might hinge on the legal specifics of verbal agreements in custody versus actual ownership. Since the author is the legal owner, they might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. \n\nHmm, but in some places, even if you own the dog, you need to follow legal procedures for custody. If the ex had joint custody, then the author can't just take the dog without their input. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow the agreed-upon process. But the ex was being uncooperative. The author might have had a valid reason, but the act of taking the dog without notice could still be legally problematic. \n\nIn California, pet custody can be tricky. If it's a verbal agreement, the court might not enforce it as strongly. But the author has legal ownership, so maybe that's the main factor. However, the ex might argue that the verbal agreement was part of the joint custody. \n\nOverall, even if the author is the legal owner, the way they took the dog without communication could be seen as wrong because it's about respecting agreements and not being confrontational. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because they broke the verbal agreement and didn't try to resolve it through legal means first.\n"
