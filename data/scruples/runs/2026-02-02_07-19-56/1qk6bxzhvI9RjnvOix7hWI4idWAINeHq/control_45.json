I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody issue between an ex couple in California and now the author has moved to New York. They had a verbal agreement that the dog would come to New York once the author was settled. But the ex changed his mind, and the author decided to fly to California and take the dog back without the ex's knowledge. The ex handed the dog over thinking the author was just visiting, but the author kept her and left.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the author mentions they legally own the dog on paper and paid for all vaccinations. In California, if there's a joint custody agreement, even if the author is the legal owner, the ex might still have some rights. But the author says it's a verbal agreement, which might not hold up in court. The ex might claim that they have shared custody now. If the author took the dog without following proper legal procedures, that could be a problem. Stealing the dog, even if it's legally theirs, might be considered theft if the ex is part of a custody agreement.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author feels manipulated and controlled by the ex. Their friends think the ex was being manipulative. The author might believe they had no choice because the ex wasn't willing to compromise. However, taking the dog without the ex's consent, even if they feel wronged, could be seen as escalating the situation. The ex might be upset and take legal action, which the author is worried about.\n\nThe ex handed the dog over under the assumption that the author was just visiting, which the author knew but didn't clarify. That seems deceptive. The author might have broken trust and potentially violated the verbal agreement. Even if the author is the legal owner, the way they took the dog could be problematic. The ex might argue that the author broke the agreement and acted without transparency.\n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, if there was a formal joint custody agreement, the author might have overstepped by taking the dog without legal process. Ethically, manipulating the ex's trust by taking the dog under false pretenses is questionable. The ex might have grounds to claim the author breached the agreement, even if the dog is legally theirs. The author's actions, while motivated by concern for the dog and feeling wronged, could be seen as wrong because they didn't follow proper legal steps and possibly acted deceitfully.\n"
