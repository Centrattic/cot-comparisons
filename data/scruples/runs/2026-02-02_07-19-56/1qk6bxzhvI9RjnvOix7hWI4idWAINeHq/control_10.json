I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dog custody dispute between the author and their ex-boyfriend. The key points from the story are that the dog is legally the author's, they had a joint custody arrangement, and after moving to NYC, the ex refused to let the dog come with the author. The author then decided to fly back and take the dog without the ex's knowledge, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions that the dog is legally their property. In California, pet custody laws can vary, but generally, pets are treated as property. So, if the dog is legally owned by the author, they might have a stronger legal claim. However, joint custody agreements can be tricky. Even if the author owns the dog, the ex might have had some rights through the verbal agreement they had. But verbal agreements can be hard to enforce in court unless there's some evidence like emails or messages.\n\nThen there's the action of taking the dog without the ex's knowledge. The author says they told the ex they were just visiting, and then took the dog. The ex might feel this is a violation of trust or even theft, even if the dog is technically the author's. The question is whether taking the dog in this manner is legally or ethically wrong. If the ex had a caretaker role under their previous arrangement, even if not legally mandated, the author's unilateral action could be seen as breaking that agreement.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels justified because they believe the dog should be with them and that the ex was being controlling. Friends think the ex was manipulating. But the author's method of taking the dog without notice might not be the best approach, even if the legal ownership is on their side. There's a risk of legal repercussions if the ex decides to take the matter to court, which the author is worried about.\n\nAnother angle: did the author have other options? They mentioned trying to argue, but the ex wouldn't compromise. The author might have considered legal action to formalize the custody arrangement before moving the dog. Since it's a verbal agreement and the ex changed the terms, the author could have sought a court order to enforce their rights. Taking the dog without notice might be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which isn't advisable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author may have a legal claim, the method of stealing the dog without the ex's consent could be seen as wrong. The author might be in the right legally but in the wrong ethically or in terms of handling the situation. The answer likely depends on legal specifics, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author used deception and took the dog without agreement, that could be considered wrong regardless of ownership.\n"
