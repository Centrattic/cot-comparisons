I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a \u201c concrete jungle \u201c in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and it\u2019s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she\u2019s still legally MY dog.. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a dog custody issue between an ex-boyfriend and the author. They had joint custody, but the author moved to NYC and wanted the dog to come with her. The ex refused, so the author flew to California and took the dog without telling him, leading to a possible legal issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions that the dog is legally their dog on paper. In California, pet custody can be tricky. While pets aren't considered children, courts might look at joint custody agreements or the best interests of the pet. Since they had a verbal agreement, that might not hold up in court. The author took the dog without consent, even if they felt it was necessary. That could be seen as theft or interference with custody, even if the dog is legally theirs.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The ex had been taking care of the dog, and the author didn't try to resolve the issue through legal means first. They acted on their own, which might have been emotionally driven. The ex might feel wronged by the surprise take. However, the author argues that the dog is their legal property and that they felt cornered.\n\nJoint custody arrangements usually require both parties to agree. If the ex is refusing to let the dog go and there's a verbal agreement, that's not enforceable. The author should've perhaps gone through mediation or a court order to legally transfer custody. Taking the dog without consent could lead to legal consequences, like being charged with theft or violating a custody agreement.\n\nAlso, the author admits they might have acted out of manipulation. Their friends said the ex was trying to control them, but the author's solution was to take the dog. This could be seen as an overreaction. Even if the dog is legally theirs, the method of retrieval is questionable. The ex might have a case if the author didn't follow the agreed-upon terms or legal procedures.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have a legal claim to the dog, the method of taking it without the ex's consent, after a verbal agreement, could be problematic. The right approach would have been to seek legal resolution. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
