I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a woman in a two-year relationship where she's been giving her boyfriend oral sex regularly, but he's only reciprocated eight times. She's upset because he admitted that he doesn't like doing it because he doesn't get anything out of it, which is different from his original excuse about a bad experience. She's stopped giving him blowjobs as a result and is considering ending the relationship if he doesn't change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's reluctance to give oral sex could be due to personal preference or past experiences. However, the author feels her pleasure is being neglected. The key points here are communication and mutual respect in the relationship. The author is expressing her needs and trying to address the imbalance, which is a valid approach. She's not wrong for wanting reciprocity in intimate acts. Relationships require mutual effort and satisfaction. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity might be a selfish attitude, as he's prioritizing his own pleasure without considering hers. The author's decision to stop giving blowjobs is a form of setting a boundary, which is her right. She's also planning to discuss this again, seeking a compromise. The fact that the boyfriend changed his reason from a bad experience to not getting anything out of it might indicate a lack of honesty or growth on his part. The author's actions are about seeking equality in the relationship. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
