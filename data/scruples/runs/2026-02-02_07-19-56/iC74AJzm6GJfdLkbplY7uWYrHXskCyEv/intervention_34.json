I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this post is at fault for stopping blowjobs because her boyfriend isn't reciprocating by giving her oral sex.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman (21F) is in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend (21M). Initially, he said he didn't like oral sex because of a bad experience. Over time, he's only done it 8 times. She recently found out that his real reason is that he \"gets nothing out of it,\" which makes her feel he's being selfish. She stops giving him blowjobs in response, and now she's considering whether she's in the wrong if this affects their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and reciprocity in a relationship. She's feeling her pleasure is secondary. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling her needs, and she's reacting by withholding something he wants. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author did try to talk to him again after being upset by his friends' comments. She felt lied to because his initial excuse was different. He's not meeting her needs, so she's adjusting her behavior. \n\nIs she wrong for stopping? Well, if the relationship isn't meeting both partners' needs, it's reasonable to seek a balance. Oral sex is a mutual act, and if one partner is giving more than the other, it's understandable for the other to feel resentful. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate could be seen as prioritizing his own pleasure, which isn't fair. The author's decision to stop could be a way to enforce mutual respect. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she's using a form of punishment, which could harm the relationship. But given that he's been aware of her feelings and still chose not to reciprocate, her actions might be justified. The main issue is the lack of reciprocity and his selfishness. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
