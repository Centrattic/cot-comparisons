I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs to her boyfriend because he doesn't reciprocate. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend initially gave an excuse about a bad experience, but now he's changed his reasoning to just not getting anything out of it. The author feels it's selfish and has stopped giving him oral, which she's done all this time. Now she's worried about potential relationship damage.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, she's in a committed relationship and expects reciprocity in intimacy. It's been two years, and he's only given oral sex 8 times. That seems really low. She's feeling used, especially since she's been giving and not getting the same in return. Her right to feel this way is important. Communication is key in relationships, and she's tried to talk to him, which is a good step.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, he changed his excuse. Initially, it was due to a bad experience, now he says he just doesn't enjoy it. Maybe he's been dishonest? The author might feel betrayed that his reason wasn't the initial one. But it's possible he's just been uncomfortable all along, not wanting to admit it. Still, two years is a long time without reciprocity.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong for changing her behavior. Relationships require mutual satisfaction. If one partner is not meeting the other's needs, it's valid to set boundaries. If he's not willing to compromise, maybe her decision is justified. She's trying to address her own needs, which is important for her well-being.\n\nIs it selfish for her to stop giving oral if he's not reciprocating? Probably not. She's asserting her needs, which is necessary in a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's behavior might be the issue here. If he's only focused on his own pleasure, that's a problem. The author's actions are a form of communication that her needs matter too.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). She's taking a stand for her own satisfaction and trying to address the imbalance in the relationship. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity is the core issue here, not her response to it.\n"
