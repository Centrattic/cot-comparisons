I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a two-year relationship where the boyfriend has only performed oral sex on the author eight times. The author initially accepted his initial excuse about a bad experience but now feels that he's being selfish because he admits it's not about her but he doesn't get anything out of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's perspective: he's been upfront about his preferences from the start and hasn't changed much. The author's perspective: she feels her pleasure is being neglected and the lack of reciprocity is unfair. She's stopped giving him oral sex as a form of protest and is considering ending the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The boyfriend was honest about his preferences early on, but the author might feel that her needs aren't being met. The boyfriend's reasoning now is different, which might have caused the author to feel lied to. However, the boyfriend hasn't forced her to stop asking, and she's made a choice to stop reciprocating as well.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whether the author's actions are justified. She's expressing her needs, which is healthy in a relationship. However, stopping oral sex as a form of punishment might be seen as a power move. But if he's not meeting her needs and she's communicated this, her decision to prioritize her own satisfaction could be seen as valid. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's advocating for her needs and seeking reciprocity. Relationships should be about mutual satisfaction. The boyfriend's initial lack of reciprocity and the change in his excuse might have justified her frustration. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
