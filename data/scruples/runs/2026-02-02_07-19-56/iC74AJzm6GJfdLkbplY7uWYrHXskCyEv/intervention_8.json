I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the initial post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the boyfriend isn't reciprocating oral sex as much as the author would like.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship. Her boyfriend has only performed vaginal oral sex on her 8 times in two years, citing a past bad experience. But now he admits it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels cheated, as she does perform oral sex on him, but he's not reciprocating. She's decided to stop giving him blowjobs unless he reciprocates, and is worried about the relationship's future.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But they want to know what others think. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author is frustrated that her partner isn't meeting her needs, and she's taken a stand by stopping oral sex unless he does the same. But is she in the wrong?\n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, it's important that both partners feel valued and that their needs are met. The boyfriend's initial excuse was a past experience, but now he's being honest about not wanting to reciprocate. The author is now standing up for her needs, which is a form of communication. However, stopping oral sex might be a form of punishment or leverage. \n\nIn healthy relationships, open communication is key. The author could be in the right by setting boundaries if she's been patient and communicated her feelings. However, using withdrawal of oral sex as a response might be seen as counterproductive, as it could escalate conflict. \n\nBut the boyfriend's lack of reciprocity is an issue. If he's only focused on his own pleasure, that's a problem. The author's decision to stop unless there's reciprocity is a way to seek balance. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. She's standing up for her needs after a period of not addressing them, which led to resentment. Her action is a form of communication, even if it might lead to conflict. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But there's nuance here. If she's willing to address the issue without punishment, that's better, but her current approach is a reaction to being unvalued.\n"
