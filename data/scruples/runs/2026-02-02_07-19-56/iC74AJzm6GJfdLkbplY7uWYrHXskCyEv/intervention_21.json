I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for deciding to stop giving blowjobs if her boyfriend doesn't reciprocate by giving her oral sex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a two-year relationship. Her boyfriend gave her an initial reason for not giving oral sex\u2014smelly vag\u2014which she accepted. Over two years, he only did it eight times. She later finds out the real reason is that he doesn't get anything out of it. She feels hurt, lied to, and now she's stopping oral sex unless he reciprocates.\n\nThe key points here are communication, reciprocity, and mutual satisfaction in a relationship. The initial excuse was about a bad experience, but the truth was different. She felt deceived. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling her needs, and she's taking action by withholding oral sex. She's also considering the relationship's future if he doesn't compromise.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and communication are crucial. If one partner is consistently not meeting the other's needs, especially in an intimate aspect, it's a valid concern. The author is expressing her frustration and taking a stand for her pleasure. However, stopping all oral sex might be seen as a form of punishment or withholding affection. Relationships require compromise and negotiation. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she's addressing her own dissatisfaction and seeking a fair exchange. If the boyfriend isn't willing to meet her halfway, then she's prioritizing her own needs. It's possible that her actions could be seen as self-serving, but it's also about asserting her boundaries after feeling taken advantage of. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of not reciprocating might be the root issue. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting reciprocity. However, the method of stopping all oral might affect the relationship dynamics. But given the context, she's justified in seeking mutual satisfaction. So, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
