I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is about a two-year relationship where the boyfriend isn't giving oral sex. Initially, he had an excuse about a bad experience, but now he's saying he just doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels it's unfair and has stopped giving him blowjobs in return, planning to not do it again unless there's reciprocity. She's considering if she's wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author tried to talk to him, and he changed his excuse. That might be a red flag. She's feeling her pleasure is secondary, which is a valid concern. Reciprocity in intimacy is important for many people. If one partner is consistently giving without getting something in return, it can create resentment. The author stopping blowjobs as a response is a form of withdrawing a behavior she's uncomfortable with, possibly to encourage reciprocity.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for her needs. If the boyfriend isn't willing to meet her halfway, maybe the issue is his unwillingness to compromise. The author's actions are a response to his not being considerate. However, relationships require mutual effort. If she stops giving blowjobs, it might be seen as punishment, but if it's to set boundaries for her own needs, it's her right. \n\nOn the flip side, if the relationship is otherwise good, maybe she should try another approach. But given that he's not willing to adjust, her stance isn't necessarily wrong. Her feelings are valid. So the answer is B for No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
