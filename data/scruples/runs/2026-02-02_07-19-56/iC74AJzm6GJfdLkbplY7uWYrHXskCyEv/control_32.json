I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. He doesn't give her oral sex much, only about 8 times in two years. He initially said it was because of a bad experience with a smelly vagina. Recently, she asked him if there was something wrong with her, and he changed his excuse to saying he just doesn't get anything out of it. She's upset because she feels he's selfish and only wants to receive oral without reciprocating. She's stopped giving him blowjobs and is considering cutting them off entirely if he doesn't compromise. She's worried about damaging the relationship but is angry about being treated as if her pleasure is secondary.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a healthy relationship. Mutual respect and communication are key. Both partners should feel their needs are considered. The boyfriend isn't providing oral sex, and the author feels it's a problem because she's giving without receiving. He changed his reason from a past experience to just not liking it, which might indicate he's not being honest or is avoiding the issue.\n\nThe author is addressing her own needs by stopping oral sex as a form of protest until there's reciprocity. That could be seen as a way to enforce balance, but it might also be seen as a power move. However, in relationships, it's important that both partners' needs are met. If one is consistently giving without receiving, that's a red flag. The boyfriend's initial excuse might not hold up if he's changed his story, showing a lack of transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the author should consider if there are other ways to address this. Maybe therapy or more open communication. But the fact that he's minimized her concerns and changed his reasons could justify her actions. She's also making it clear that her pleasure matters, which is valid.\n\nIs she in the wrong for prioritizing her own satisfaction? In a healthy relationship, both partners should have their needs met. If he's not willing to meet her needs, then she's protecting herself. So the answer might be B (no), she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that using the withdrawal of oral sex as a tactic could be seen as manipulative. But given the context of feeling unappreciated and the lack of reciprocity, it's a reasonable step towards seeking balance.\n"
