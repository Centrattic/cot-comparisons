I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the woman is upset that her boyfriend doesn't reciprocate oral sex. He initially gave an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted it's because he doesn't enjoy it and only wants to do things that please himself. She's now stopped giving blowjobs because she's fed up, and she's considering ending things if he doesn't compromise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the woman's perspective, she feels her pleasure is being disregarded. She's in a relationship where she's giving without expecting much in return, which might be leading to resentment. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity could be seen as selfish, especially since she's making an effort. However, people have different preferences and boundaries, and it's possible that the boyfriend isn't comfortable with reciprocal oral sex due to personal reasons, even if they seem selfish.\n\nBut then, consent and mutual respect are key in relationships. If one partner is uncomfortable with a sexual activity, the other shouldn't force them. However, the woman is now withholding a sexual act as a form of leverage. That might be seen as using a negative tactic. But she's also standing up for her needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. The question is whether her approach is wrong.\n\nThe original question is if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thinks she's in the wrong but wants to know. I need to evaluate if her decision is justified. The woman has been making a sacrifice for two years without reciprocity, leading to resentment. Stopping the behavior is a form of asserting her needs, which is valid. However, withholding sex can be a contentious issue. But given that the boyfriend isn't reciprocating, her action could be seen as a necessary step to address imbalance.\n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship is otherwise healthy except for this one issue, maybe there's room for compromise. The woman's approach might be confrontational, but given the lack of reciprocity and the boyfriend's admission of self-interest, her stance is understandable. The key factors here are communication and mutual respect. The woman is trying to communicate her needs, which is positive. The boyfriend's refusal to meet halfway might be the real issue here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's standing up for her needs and trying to address an imbalance, then no. The boyfriend's behavior might be the problem, not hers. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
