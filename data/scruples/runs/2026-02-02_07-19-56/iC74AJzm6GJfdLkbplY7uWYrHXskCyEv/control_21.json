I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after deciding to stop giving her boyfriend blowjobs because he doesn't reciprocate with oral sex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend initially gave an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted he just doesn't like giving oral because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish because she gives him oral all the time, and now she's stopping unless he reciprocates. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual satisfaction are important. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be a lack of reciprocity, which is a common issue in relationships. The author has tried to talk to him, and when he didn't meet her needs, she decided to stop giving him oral. \n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the balance of mutual pleasure. The author isn't demanding something that's non-consensual; she's setting a boundary based on her needs. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate could be seen as prioritizing his own pleasure over hers, which might be unhealthy. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is using oral sex as a bargaining chip, which could be seen as manipulation. But the main issue here is the lack of reciprocity. The author made a clear boundary after feeling her needs were being disregarded. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about the dynamics of their relationship. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own pleasure and addressing the imbalance. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
