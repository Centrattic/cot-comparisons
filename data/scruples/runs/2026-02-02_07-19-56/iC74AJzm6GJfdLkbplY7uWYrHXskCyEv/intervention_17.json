I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's upset because he rarely gives her oral sex, only 8 times in two years. Initially, he told her he didn't like it because of a bad experience with a smelly vagina. Now, he says he just doesn't get anything out of it. She feels he's being selfish and has stopped giving him blowjobs unless he reciprocates. She's considering ending the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The author did approach the topic, asking if something was wrong, and he changed his reason. That might make her feel betrayed or lied to. But does that mean she's in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs? She's expressing her needs, which is healthy. Reciprocity in a relationship is important. If one partner isn't meeting the other's needs, it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, cutting off all oral sex without discussion might be an extreme step. But she did mention planning to talk to him again. If he's unwilling to compromise, then her actions are a response to his lack of reciprocity. The question is whether her actions are justified. Since she's standing up for her own needs and setting boundaries, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity is the issue here. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
