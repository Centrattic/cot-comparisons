I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a two-year relationship where the boyfriend refuses to give oral sex, and now the author is considering stopping giving him blowjobs as a form of reciprocation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend initially gave an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted he just doesn't enjoy it. The author feels their pleasure is being prioritized over hers, leading her to stop giving oral to balance things out. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author communicated her feelings and tried to understand his reasons. When he changed his excuse, she felt misled. Now, she's taking action to protect her own pleasure by stopping oral sex unless it's reciprocated. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, if a relationship isn't meeting both partners' needs, it's reasonable to seek balance. The author's action is a response to a lack of reciprocity. She's not forcing him to do something; she's removing a behavior that was previously one-sided. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that stopping oral sex could be seen as a form of punishment, which isn't ideal. However, the author's reasoning is about her own needs and boundaries. If the boyfriend isn't willing to compromise, the author's decision to prioritize her own satisfaction isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe main point is about consent and mutual satisfaction. Neither partner is obligated to perform acts they don't want, but both should aim for reciprocity. The author's move to stop unless there's reciprocity might be a valid step towards a healthier balance. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
