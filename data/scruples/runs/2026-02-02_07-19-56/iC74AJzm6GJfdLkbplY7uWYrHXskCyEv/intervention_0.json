I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. He hasn't given her oral sex much, only 8 times total, and his reason changed from a past bad experience to just not liking it because he doesn't get anything out of it. She's upset because she's been doing oral on him a lot and feels it's not reciprocated. She stopped giving him blowjobs because she's tired of not getting anything in return and wants mutual pleasure. She plans to talk to him again and might end the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, especially regarding intimacy. The boyfriend initially gave a reason (smelly vag) but later admitted it's not about her but his preference. The author feels misled because the reason changed. She's now cutting off oral sex as a form of leverage to get reciprocity.\n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, both partners should have open communication about their needs and boundaries. The boyfriend's refusal to give oral sex is his personal choice, but the author's response is to stop giving him oral as well. This could be seen as a form of negotiation or tit-for-tat. However, using withdrawal of a sexual act as a punishment or leverage might not be healthy if it's without mutual agreement.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if she feels her pleasure is being neglected. Reciprocity in sexual acts is important for many people, and if one partner is consistently giving without receiving, it can lead to resentment. However, the method of addressing it matters. The author is planning to stop giving him oral, which could be seen as a personal choice to prioritize her own needs. If the relationship can't accommodate mutual needs, then perhaps the relationship isn't balanced.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, it's a matter of perspective. If the boyfriend is not meeting her needs and isn't willing to compromise, she has the right to express her boundaries. However, using withdrawal of a sexual act as a punishment might not be the healthiest approach. Open communication where both express their needs and work towards a solution is better. If the boyfriend is unwilling to adjust, then the author's decision to stop reciprocating might be a way to enforce equality. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both sides have their own perspectives. The boyfriend's reluctance isn't her fault, but her feeling that she's being used is valid. Her choice to stop giving him oral is a way to demand reciprocity. Unless there's non-consensual pressure, she's not wrong for setting boundaries. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one partner isn't willing to meet halfway, the other has the right to reassess the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her needs and trying to create a balanced dynamic. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate is the issue here, not her response to it.\n"
