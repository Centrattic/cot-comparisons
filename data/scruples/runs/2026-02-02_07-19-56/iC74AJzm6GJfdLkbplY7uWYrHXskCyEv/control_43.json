I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship where she's been giving her boyfriend blowjobs frequently, but he only gives her oral sex eight times. She feels it's unfair because he's not reciprocating. Initially, he had an excuse about a bad experience, but now he says he just doesn't get anything out of it. She's angry and stopped giving him blowjobs now. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Mutual respect and communication are key in any relationship, especially regarding intimacy. The author mentions that she's been giving him oral sex all the time, but he's not reciprocating. He changed his excuse from a past experience to just not enjoying it. That could indicate that he's not being honest or is avoiding responsibility.\n\nShe feels her pleasure is being secondary. The fact that he's not meeting her needs and not being honest about his reasons might be a problem. She stopped giving him blowjobs as a form of protest, which could be seen as a way to make him aware of her feelings. However, withholding intimacy can be a way to express dissatisfaction, but it might also lead to conflict.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for her needs, which is valid. No one should feel they have to give without receiving. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity could be the main issue here. However, the method she's using\u2014stopping blowjobs\u2014might be seen as a form of punishment, but if it's to demand mutual respect, it's understandable.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author should have addressed this earlier instead of waiting two years. But she's in a position where she's now taking action to make things fair. The boyfriend's behavior of not being honest and not considering her needs could be the real problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting reciprocity and taking steps to ensure her needs are met. Therefore, the answer would be B, No.\n"
