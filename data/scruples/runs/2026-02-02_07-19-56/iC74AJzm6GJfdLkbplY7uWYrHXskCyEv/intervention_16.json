I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the boyfriend is not reciprocating oral sex as the author expects.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that her boyfriend initially had an excuse (a bad experience with a smelly vagina) but now admits he just \"gets nothing out of it,\" meaning he doesn't enjoy giving oral. The author feels used because she gives him oral regularly but he doesn't reciprocate. She's stopped performing oral on him as a form of protest and is considering walking away if he doesn't compromise.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author did ask him again after feeling upset, and he changed his reason. This might indicate that his initial excuse was a way to avoid the issue. The author's decision to stop giving blowjobs is a response to his lack of reciprocity. It's important to note that both partners have the right to express their needs and boundaries. If one partner feels their needs aren't being met, it's valid to set boundaries, even if it risks the relationship. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of ethical considerations, it's not wrong to prioritize one's own needs and seek mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity could be seen as self-centered, and the author's actions are a form of standing up for her own needs. \n\nBut I should also consider that the author is using withholding oral sex as leverage. Some might argue this could be seen as manipulative. However, if the relationship is based on mutual respect and consent, both partners should aim for reciprocity. The author's frustration stems from feeling that her pleasure is secondary, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for advocating for her own needs and setting boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
