I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. The main issue is that he doesn't give her oral sex. Initially, he said it was because of a bad experience with a smelly vagina, but now he's admitted it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish, especially since she gives him oral sex a lot. She's stopped giving him blowjobs as a result and is considering not doing it again unless it's reciprocated. She's worried about the relationship but feels like her pleasure is being put second.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong by stopping giving blowjobs. The answer options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Both partners should ideally have their needs and desires met in a healthy relationship. Communication is key here. The author tried to address the issue, and the boyfriend changed his reason from a past bad experience to just not enjoying it. The author feels that since she's giving oral to him, it should be reciprocated. She's now choosing to stop giving him blowjobs as a form of reciprocity or to demand it in return.\n\nIs it fair for her to stop giving oral if he's not willing to reciprocate? Well, mutual respect and consent are important. If one partner is uncomfortable with certain acts, they can choose not to partake. However, in this case, the author is using her own actions as leverage to get what she wants. Stopping an act she's comfortable with to pressure the other partner into doing something he's not comfortable with. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend is already not doing something she wants. She's been giving oral, and now she's stopping to show that she's not okay with the imbalance. Is this a healthy approach? It might be a form of negotiation. However, the key point is whether her action is wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, open communication is crucial. The author has tried to discuss it, and the boyfriend hasn't been honest initially. Now that she's aware of his true reason, she's frustrated. Her decision to stop giving blowjobs could be seen as a way to balance the relationship. If the boyfriend is unwilling to meet her needs, she's setting a boundary. \n\nBut is that wrong? If she's in a relationship where mutual respect and compromise are expected, then she's not wrong to set boundaries. However, if the act of stopping is causing harm to the relationship without a chance to resolve it, maybe that's a problem. But given the context, she's planning to discuss it again. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But generally, in relationships, both parties should feel their needs are met. If one is consistently not meeting the other's needs without valid reasons, the other has the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's initial lie and then admitting selfishness might be the bigger issue. The author's response is a reaction to that, so she's not necessarily in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
