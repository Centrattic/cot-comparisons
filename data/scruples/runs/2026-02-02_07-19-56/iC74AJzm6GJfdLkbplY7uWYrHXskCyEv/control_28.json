I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year stable relationship with her boyfriend, also 21. The issue is that he hasn't been giving her oral sex for most of the relationship, only eight times. Initially, he cited a bad experience with a smelly vagina, but now he admits he just doesn't enjoy it and doesn't get anything out of it. She's upset because she feels she's been accommodating his discomfort for too long, while she's been providing oral sex to him. She stopped giving him blowjobs in protest and is considering not doing it again unless he reciprocates. She's worried about the relationship if this leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong by stopping giving oral sex. The key points here are communication, consent, and mutual satisfaction in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, sexual activities should be consensual and based on mutual respect and satisfaction. If one partner is consistently not fulfilling a request or expectation that the other has, especially if it's affecting their satisfaction, it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's initial excuse was a past bad experience, but now he's admitting it's because he doesn't enjoy it. That makes it seem like he's not putting in the effort to reciprocate, which can be seen as selfish. \n\nThe author was initially understanding of his discomfort but feels she's been accommodating him without reciprocity. Her decision to stop giving oral sex is a form of seeking balance. It's important to consider that both partners should feel their needs are met. If one is consistently giving and the other isn't, that can lead to resentment. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for stopping. The answer would depend on whether her action is a reasonable response to his lack of reciprocity. Since she's communicating her feelings and is trying to find a compromise, it's a form of standing up for her own needs. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about mutual consent and respect. If the author is not comfortable continuing without reciprocity, she isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate could be a problem he needs to address, but the author's right to express her needs is valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
