I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering stopping giving blowjobs because her boyfriend doesn't reciprocate with oral sex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship. Her boyfriend told her initially that he didn't like oral due to a bad experience. She accepted that and didn't push. But over two years, he only gave it to her 8 times. Recently, he told her that he just doesn't like it because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author is upset, feels selfish, and has stopped giving him blowjobs unless it's reciprocated. She's considering ending the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The boyfriend changed his reason from a past trauma to personal dislike. The author felt lied to because the initial excuse was different. She's now asserting her needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend isn't meeting her needs, and she's feeling used because she's giving without reciprocity. Stopping the oral sex is her way of setting boundaries. But does that make her wrong? It's a matter of mutual needs. If the relationship is based on reciprocity and one party isn't fulfilling their end, it's reasonable for the other to seek balance. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author didn't address the issue sooner or that stopping oral sex without discussion could be seen as a tit-for-tat. But the author did communicate her feelings and tried to understand his reasons. Now she's setting boundaries after feeling neglected. \n\nFrom a relational standpoint, both partners have the right to express their needs. The boyfriend's behavior could be seen as selfish, and the author is prioritizing her own well-being. So, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. The key points are communication, mutual respect, and reciprocity. She's acting to address a long-standing issue, not just reacting impulsively. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
