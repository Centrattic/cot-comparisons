I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs if her boyfriend refuses to reciprocate by giving her oral sex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend said initially he didn't like giving oral sex because of a past experience, but later admitted he just doesn't like it because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels she's been lied to and is now stopping giving him blowjobs to reciprocate. She's planning to bring it up again and possibly end the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect, communication, and reciprocity in a relationship. The author has been giving oral sex frequently, but the boyfriend isn't returning the favor. The author is now choosing to stop as a form of protest. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should feel respected and their needs met. If one partner is consistently not fulfilling the other's needs and isn't willing to reciprocate, it's a problem. The boyfriend's excuse changed from a past trauma to just not liking it, which seems dismissive of the author's feelings. The author's decision to stop giving oral sex is a form of asserting her own needs, which is valid. However, stopping abruptly might affect the relationship, but the main issue is the lack of reciprocity and honesty from the boyfriend.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her actions are justified. Since the boyfriend isn't reciprocating and the author is standing up for her own needs, it might be that she's not in the wrong. The problem lies more with the boyfriend's behavior and lack of compromise. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
