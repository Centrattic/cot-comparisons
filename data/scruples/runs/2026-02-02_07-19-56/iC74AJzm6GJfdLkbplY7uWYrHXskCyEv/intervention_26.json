I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs to her boyfriend because he doesn't reciprocate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for two years. The boyfriend initially gave a reason (bad experience) for not giving oral sex, but now admits he just doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish and stops giving him blowjobs as a form of protest, planning to bring it up again. She's considering ending the relationship if there's no compromise.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication about needs are important. The boyfriend's change in excuse from a past trauma to just not liking it might indicate dishonesty or not addressing the issue. The author feels her pleasure is secondary, which is a valid concern. Reciprocity in intimacy is common in healthy relationships. However, using the withdrawal of a sexual act as a form of punishment might escalate conflict. But it's important to consider whether she communicated her feelings and if he's open to compromise.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual satisfaction. If both partners aren't meeting each other's needs and there's no willingness to discuss solutions, the relationship might be imbalanced. The author's decision is based on her right to have her needs met, but the method (stopping oral without resolution) could be seen as a last resort. However, given the context, it's a matter of personal boundaries. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: if both partners are not compromising, the blame isn't on one side. The boyfriend not being truthful and not trying to meet her needs could be his part. The author acting on her boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
