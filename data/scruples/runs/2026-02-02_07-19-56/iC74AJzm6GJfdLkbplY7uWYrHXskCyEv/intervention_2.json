I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the author (a woman) is upset that her boyfriend doesn't reciprocate oral sex. He used to say it was because of a bad experience, but now he says he doesn't get anything out of it. The author stops giving blowjobs in response and is considering ending things unless he compromises.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The boyfriend initially gave an excuse that seemed like a valid reason (a past experience), but later changed his reasoning to not getting pleasure from it. The author feels that oral sex should be reciprocal and that her pleasure is being overlooked. She's standing up for her needs, which is important. But is she in the wrong?\n\nWell, relationships require both partners to meet each other's needs. If one partner isn't willing to reciprocate, it can create imbalance. The author is asserting her right to have her needs met, which is reasonable. However, stopping oral sex as a form of punishment might be seen as a power play. But considering her reasons\u2014feeling that her pleasure is secondary\u2014it's more about self-respect than punishment. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior could be selfish if he's not willing to compromise. The author is trying to address the issue through communication again. The fact that she's contemplating ending the relationship if there's no resolution suggests she's trying to resolve it, which is mature. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? I think not. She's addressing a legitimate issue in a relationship where reciprocity is expected. Her actions are based on wanting mutual respect. Answering A would mean she's wrong, but B would mean she's not. Based on the analysis, the answer should be B.\n"
