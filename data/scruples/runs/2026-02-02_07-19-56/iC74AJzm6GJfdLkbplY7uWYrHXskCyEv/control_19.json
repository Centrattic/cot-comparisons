I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the author (21F) and her boyfriend (21M) have been together for two years. The main issue is that he rarely gives her oral sex. Initially, he said it was due to a bad experience with a smelly vagina, but later admitted it's just that he doesn't enjoy it and doesn't get anything out of it. The author is upset because she reciprocates by giving him blowjobs often and feels it's not fair. She stopped giving him blowjobs now, and is considering not doing it unless he reciprocates. The question is whether she's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Both partners are adults and should be able to communicate their needs and boundaries. The boyfriend's initial excuse was a past bad experience, which the author accepted. However, he later changed his reason to not liking it because it doesn't benefit him. The author feels this is selfish and wants reciprocity. She's stopping giving blowjobs as a form of protest, which is a form of withholding a sexual act.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and communication. The boyfriend isn't being honest from the start, changing his reason, which might have made the author feel lied to. The author is now asserting her needs, which is a valid step. However, using the withholding of sexual acts as a response could be seen as a form of punishment. In healthy relationships, open communication is key. The author's intention is to seek reciprocity, which is understandable. But whether it's \"wrong\" depends on cultural or personal values. In many perspectives, mutual satisfaction and consent are important. The boyfriend's lack of willingness to reciprocate might be a red flag. The author's reaction is a form of self-respect and setting boundaries. So, the answer would likely be B (No), as the author is not in the wrong for seeking mutual respect in her sexual relationship.\n"
