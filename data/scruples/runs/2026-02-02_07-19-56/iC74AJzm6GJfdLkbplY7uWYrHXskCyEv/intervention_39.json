I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping oral sex with her boyfriend due to him not reciprocating. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The boyfriend has a history of not performing oral sex on her, changing his reason from a past bad experience to just not liking it. The author feels her pleasure is secondary, and she's unhappy with the lack of reciprocity. She's decided to stop giving him blowjobs unless he reciprocates.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication, and mutual respect. The boyfriend's initial excuse was a bad experience, but later he admits it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. This seems like a shift in his reasoning, which the author feels is a lie. The author's decision to stop reciprocating is a form of negotiation to balance the sexual relationship. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships should be about mutual respect and satisfaction. If one partner is consistently not meeting the other's needs without valid reasons, it's a problem. The author is asserting her needs, which is reasonable. However, using withholding of oral sex as a response might be seen as a tactic, but if it's leading to a discussion about mutual needs, it's part of healthy communication.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author's actions are justified. Since the boyfriend isn't meeting her sexual needs and the author is trying to address it through communication and compromise, her stance seems justified. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) as she's addressing a lack of reciprocity in a relationship that's otherwise stable.\n"
