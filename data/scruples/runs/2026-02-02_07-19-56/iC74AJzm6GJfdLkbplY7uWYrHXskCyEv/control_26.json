I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the boyfriend isn't giving her oral sex and she feels it's not being reciprocated. She's been giving him blowjobs a lot, but he's only given her oral eight times in two years. He initially had an excuse about a bad experience, but later changed it to not liking it because he doesn't get anything out of it. She's now angry and stopped giving him blowjobs, planning to stop entirely unless it's reciprocated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect and communication in a relationship. Both partners should feel their needs are met. The boyfriend's initial excuse was a past experience, but later changed to personal preference. The author feels her pleasure is secondary, which is a valid concern. She's communicating her feelings, which is good. She's not just being selfish; she's seeking reciprocity. Oral sex is a common form of intimacy, and if one partner is doing it frequently without the other reciprocating, it can create imbalance. \n\nIs it fair for her to stop giving blowjobs as a response? If the issue is about reciprocity and her needs aren't being met, then her decision to stop could be a way to encourage mutual respect. However, relationships require compromise. If she's willing to talk it out, maybe there's a middle ground. But if he's not willing to meet her halfway, her stance isn't unreasonable. She's not wrong for wanting equality in the relationship. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her needs and seeking a balanced relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
