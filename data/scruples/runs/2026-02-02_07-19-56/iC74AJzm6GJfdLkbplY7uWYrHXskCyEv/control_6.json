I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a woman in a two-year relationship who's upset because her boyfriend refuses to give her oral sex most of the time. Initially, he had an excuse about a bad experience, but now he's changed it to not liking it because he doesn't get anything out of it. She's angry at being lied to and feeling that her pleasure is secondary. She's stopped giving him blowjobs as a result and is considering bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships and sexual reciprocity. In many relationships, mutual pleasure is important. If one partner is consistently not engaging in an act that the other finds important, it can create imbalance. The boyfriend's initial excuse was about a past experience, but he later admitted it's about his own pleasure. That could be seen as dishonesty, which is a factor in the author's feelings.\n\nThe author is choosing to stop giving blowjobs to assert that her pleasure matters. It's a form of reciprocal action. But is this the wrong approach? Maybe there are other ways to address the issue, like open communication or seeking counseling. However, relationships require compromise, and if both parties aren't willing to meet in the middle, it can lead to problems. The author feels wronged, and the boyfriend isn't meeting her needs. But is she in the wrong for stopping? It depends on the context. If she's using it as leverage, that could be seen as a negative tactic. But if it's a boundary due to feeling unappreciated, it might be justified.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior of only doing things that please him is a red flag. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No) because she's setting a boundary based on mutual respect and reciprocity. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate is the primary issue here. The author isn't wrong for wanting her needs met and adjusting her behavior accordingly.\n"
