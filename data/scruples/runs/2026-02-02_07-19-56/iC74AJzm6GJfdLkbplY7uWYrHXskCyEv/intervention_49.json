I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. The main issue is that he doesn't give her oral sex as much as she'd like. Initially, he had an excuse about a bad experience, but now he admits it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. She feels this is selfish, especially since she reciprocates by giving him blowjobs. She's stopped giving him oral now as a form of protest and is considering ending the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author tried to address the issue directly after hearing his friends, which shows she's made an effort to understand his reasons. His initial excuse changed, which might have made her feel lied to or misled. The concept of reciprocity in sexual acts is important to her, and she's frustrated that her pleasure is being prioritized lower because he doesn't enjoy giving oral sex.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's expressing her needs and setting boundaries. If one partner is consistently prioritizing their own pleasure over the other's, that's a red flag. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate could lead to resentment. However, everyone has different turn-ons and turn-offs. The boyfriend's reluctance might not be malicious but could be a genuine lack of enjoyment. That said, the author has a right to feel that her needs aren't being met, especially if she finds oral sex fulfilling and he doesn't reciprocate.\n\nThe author's decision to stop giving blowjobs is a form of asserting her boundaries. While it might strain the relationship, she's making it clear that her comfort and satisfaction matter. The boyfriend's change in excuse from a past trauma to a current preference might have triggered her feeling that he was dishonest. It's possible he's being selfish, but it's also possible he's being honest about his current feelings. Either way, the author's decision stems from her need for mutual respect and reciprocity, which are valid in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's standing up for her needs and seeking a balanced relationship. The boyfriend's behavior could be the issue here, but the author's actions are a response to that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
