I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (21F) has been in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend (21M). The main issue is that he doesn't give her oral sex, only doing it eight times in two years. She tried to understand his initial excuse about a bad experience but now he says he just doesn't get anything out of it. She's angry because she feels it's unfair and has stopped giving him blowjobs as a form of reciprocation. She's planning to talk to him again and might end the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants to know my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. In a relationship, mutual respect and communication are key. Both partners should feel their needs are met. The boyfriend's excuse changed from a bad experience to not getting anything out of it. That might be a problem because he's not addressing her needs. The author feels that oral sex should be reciprocal, which is a common expectation in relationships. She communicated her feelings and stopped giving him oral sex as a way to balance the power dynamic. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, if the boyfriend is not meeting her sexual needs, she has the right to express that. Ending or changing the relationship based on unmet needs isn't necessarily wrong. However, communication is crucial. The author did talk to him, so she's not just acting out of nowhere. Her action of stopping oral sex could be seen as a form of encouragement for him to reciprocate, which is a valid stance. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that stopping oral sex could be seen as a punishment or manipulation. But given that she's communicated her feelings and tried to address it, it's more about setting boundaries. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner is consistently not meeting the other's needs, it's a fair concern. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs and trying to get reciprocal treatment. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic because he's not addressing her needs and changed his excuse. The author's actions are a response to that, so the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
