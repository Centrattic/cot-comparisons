I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a two-year relationship where the boyfriend rarely gives oral sex, giving a bad experience as an excuse at first. Now he says he just doesn't get pleasure from it. The author stops giving him blowjobs in response and is considering ending the relationship if it's not reciprocated.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author feels that oral sex should be reciprocal. She's been giving it a lot but only getting it 8 times in two years. The boyfriend initially had an excuse, but now it's a personal preference. The author feels her pleasure is being neglected, leading her to stop giving blowjobs as a form of protest.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author has tried to discuss the issue, and the boyfriend's response was that he doesn't enjoy it. But the author feels it's selfish. Now she's using reciprocity as a way to enforce change. Is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel her needs aren't met. If a partner is unwilling to meet her needs despite communication, it's reasonable to reconsider the relationship. On the other hand, stopping blowjobs as a punishment might be seen as withholding what she's been doing to get what she wants. However, if she was doing it out of obligation and not reciprocity before, maybe she's justified.\n\nThe question is whether her actions are in the wrong. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity could be seen as selfish, as she mentioned. The author's response is to stop giving oral in return. If the problem is lack of mutual satisfaction, her action is a form of asserting her needs. But withholding is a form of punishment, which can be seen as negative in communication. However, if the initial behavior was already unbalanced, maybe she's correcting the imbalance.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author tried to communicate her feelings after the initial excuse, but the boyfriend didn't change. Now she's taking action to protect her own needs. Whether this is wrong depends on cultural or moral perspectives. Some might say it's fair to stop giving something you're not getting in return. Others might say that using withholding as leverage isn't constructive. However, given the boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate despite knowing her feelings, the author might not be in the wrong here. She's prioritizing her own needs after repeated neglect. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
