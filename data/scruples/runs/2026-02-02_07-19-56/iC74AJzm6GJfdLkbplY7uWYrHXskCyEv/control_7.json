I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs because her boyfriend doesn't reciprocate by giving her oral sex.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and her boyfriend have been together for two years. He initially had an excuse (a bad experience) for not giving oral, but now he admits he just doesn't like it. The author feels it's unfair since she does oral for him often and he doesn't reciprocate. She's stopped giving him oral in response and is considering ending the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nI need to assess if her actions are justified. She's expressing her needs and boundaries, which is important in any relationship. Reciprocity in sexual activities is a common expectation, and feeling that one's needs are neglected can lead to resentment. The boyfriend changed his excuse from a bad experience to not enjoying it, which might feel like a betrayal or dishonesty. The author's decision to stop oral is a form of asserting her own needs, not just about getting something out of it, but about mutual respect and equality in the relationship.\n\nHowever, communication is crucial. The author did talk to him again and is planning to bring it up, indicating she's trying to resolve the issue. Ending or damaging the relationship over this could be a consequence of not reaching a mutual understanding, but it's also about whether the relationship is meeting both partners' needs.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel valued and respected. If one person's basic needs are consistently unmet, it's reasonable to address it. The author isn't just being selfish; she's seeking balance. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate, even after an honest conversation, could indicate a deeper issue about prioritizing his own pleasure over hers, which is problematic.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her needs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
