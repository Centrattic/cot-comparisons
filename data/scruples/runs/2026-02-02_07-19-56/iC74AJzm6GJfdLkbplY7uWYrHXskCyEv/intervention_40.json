I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs because her boyfriend isn't reciprocating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship. She's been giving oral sex to her boyfriend but he only gives it to her occasionally. Initially, he had an excuse about a bad experience, but now he admits he just doesn't get anything out of it. She feels used because she's not getting reciprocal pleasure. She's stopped giving blowjobs and is considering ending this if he doesn't compromise.\n\nThe key points here are communication, reciprocity, and mutual respect. Open communication is crucial in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. The boyfriend changed his reason from a bad experience to personal preference, which the author feels is a lie or an excuse. She's upset because she's not getting what she wants in return, leading to her decision to stop reciprocating.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships are about mutual satisfaction. If one partner is consistently unhappy with the sexual dynamics, it's reasonable to seek a change. The author is asserting her needs after trying to accommodate her boyfriend's initial reluctance. Her decision to stop giving oral sex is a form of communication that her needs aren't being met. However, the method of doing it without prior discussion might be abrupt. But given the context, she did mention planning to talk to him again, so maybe she's still in the negotiation phase.\n\nThe boyfriend's stance of not reciprocating because he doesn't enjoy it could be seen as selfish if it's causing her distress. The author's frustration is valid because she's feeling her pleasure is secondary. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner is consistently sacrificing their own needs, that's a problem.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own needs after trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity is the main issue here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
