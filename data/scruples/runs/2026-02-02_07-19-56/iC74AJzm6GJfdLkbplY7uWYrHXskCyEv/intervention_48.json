I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is upset because her boyfriend doesn't perform oral sex on her as much as she'd like. Initially, he gave an excuse about a bad experience, but now he says he just doesn't get anything out of it. She's angry he's being selfish and has stopped giving him blowjobs to reciprocate, planning to cut it off unless he complies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The boyfriend had an initial reason but then changed his stance, which might have made the author feel lied to. The key issue here is about reciprocity and communication in their sexual relationship. The author feels her pleasure is secondary, which affects her satisfaction and trust.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are crucial. If one partner is uninterested in certain activities and the other feels it's important, they need to find a middle ground. The author's decision to stop oral sex as a form of retaliation might be seen as a way to enforce reciprocity, but it could also be a power play that might harm the relationship. However, if the boyfriend is being selfish and not considering her needs, the author has a valid point about wanting equal exchange.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that everyone has different turn-ons, and the author should accept her partner's preferences unless there's a deeper issue. However, the boyfriend's change in excuse from a bad experience to just not caring suggests a lack of effort or consideration. The author's frustration stems from feeling used and not valued equally, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nConsidering that the author is trying to address the imbalance by setting boundaries, it's about whether their actions are justified. If the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise, the author's decision to stop reciprocating could be a reasonable step to prioritize her own needs and seek a more balanced relationship. Therefore, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
