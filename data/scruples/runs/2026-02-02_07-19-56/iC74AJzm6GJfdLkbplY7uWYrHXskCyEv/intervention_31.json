I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for stopping blowjobs in her relationship. The situation is that her boyfriend hasn't given her oral sex much, and his reasons changed from a past bad experience to just not enjoying it. She's upset because she feels he's being selfish and wants reciprocity. She stopped giving him blowjobs in response.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical aspects here. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend initially gave a reason (past experience) that he later changed to just not enjoying it. The author feels this is a lie or at least a contradiction, making her feel like her pleasure isn't valued. She's now stopping oral sex as a form of protest or to seek fairness.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, in a consensual relationship, both partners should have the right to express their needs and boundaries. The boyfriend's lack of willingness to reciprocate might be an issue, especially if it's affecting her satisfaction. However, the author is choosing to withhold a sexual act as a form of leverage. This could be seen as a form of conditional consent, which some might argue is a problem because consent should be freely given without pressure. But others might say it's about seeking balance and addressing the imbalance in the relationship.\n\nCommunication is crucial. The author did talk to her boyfriend, so she's not just arbitrarily stopping without discussion. She's trying to address the issue. The boyfriend's change in reasoning might indicate he's not being honest or is being selfish. If the relationship is built on mutual respect, he should be open to compromise. If he's not, then the author's actions might be justified as seeking equity.\n\nBut is she in the wrong for using her own actions to enforce reciprocity? Some might say that in a healthy relationship, both parties should want to please each other without needing to be forced. However, if one partner is consistently unhappy with the lack of reciprocity, it's reasonable for them to express that. The author's decision could be seen as self-respect and prioritizing her own needs, which is not inherently wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, withholding sex can be a form of emotional manipulation. However, if it's a mutual negotiation and she's communicating her needs, it's more about setting boundaries. The key is whether her actions are respectful and part of an ongoing dialogue. If she's giving him the chance to adjust and not pressuring him beyond that, then she's acting responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's addressing an imbalance she feels exists in the relationship and is seeking reciprocity. Her actions are a form of self-advocacy, which is important in any partnership. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
