I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who's been in a two-year relationship and feels her boyfriend isn't giving her enough oral sex. He initially gave an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted he just doesn't like doing it because he doesn't get anything out of it. She's angry and stopped giving blowjobs in return, considering ending the relationship if he doesn't reciprocate.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The woman's perspective: she feels her needs aren't being met, especially after being misled. She's trying to communicate her feelings and seek reciprocity. The boyfriend's perspective: he's upfront about not enjoying giving oral, but maybe he's not aware of how much it affects her. The initial excuse was a bad experience, but he later changed his stance, which might have made her feel lied to. \n\nCommunication is key here. The woman did approach him again after learning the truth and is planning to bring it up again. Her action of stopping oral sex is a form of negotiation. Relationships require mutual satisfaction, and if one partner isn't meeting the other's needs, it's valid to address it. However, whether she's in the wrong could depend on cultural or personal values about reciprocity in relationships. Some might argue that oral sex is a personal choice and she shouldn't feel obligated. Others might see it as a matter of fairness. The fact that she communicated her feelings and is seeking compromise suggests she's not inconsiderate. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate could be seen as the issue here. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong since she's advocating for her own needs and trying to resolve the issue constructively.\n"
