I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping oral sex with her boyfriend because he isn't reciprocating. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together two years. The boyfriend initially said he didn't want to give oral due to a past experience, but now he's changed his reason to not liking it because he gets nothing out of it. The author feels this is selfish, as she gives him oral often but he hardly reciprocates. She stopped giving him blowjobs as a consequence.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong for doing that. Let's break it down. The author is expressing her needs and boundaries. She's not happy with the lack of reciprocity. The boyfriend isn't meeting her sexual needs, which is causing her distress. She's taking action by stopping an activity that's uncomfortable for her. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The boyfriend changed his reason, which the author found misleading. She's now asserting that she wants reciprocity. Stopping oral sex as a form of response might be a personal choice, but is it wrong? \n\nIt's about consent and mutual satisfaction. If one person is not getting their needs met, it's valid to express that. The author is trying to address the imbalance. The boyfriend might need to reconsider his stance, but the author isn't wrong for seeking a reciprocal relationship. \n\nHowever, the act of withholding something to make him reciprocate could be seen as a form of manipulation. But given the context of her frustration and the boyfriend not meeting her needs, it's more about setting boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs in a long-term relationship where communication was lacking. The answer is B.\n"
