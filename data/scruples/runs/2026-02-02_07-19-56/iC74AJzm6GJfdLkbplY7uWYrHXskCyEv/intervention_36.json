I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 21-year-old woman, has been in a relationship for almost two years. Her boyfriend doesn't give her oral sex much\u2014only 8 times in two years. He initially had an excuse about a bad experience, but now he just says he doesn't like doing it because he \"gets nothing out of it.\" The author is upset because she feels she's been doing it a lot without reciprocity. She's stopped giving him blowjobs now and is considering if that's the right move, possibly leading to the relationship ending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is expressing her frustration about a lack of reciprocity in their sexual activities. She's communicated her feelings to him, and he admitted that it's not about her but that he just doesn't enjoy it. She feels it's selfish of him not to reciprocate, given that she's willing to give oral sex. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong by stopping blowjobs. The key points here are consent, communication, mutual respect, and reciprocity. The author has made it clear that she's unhappy with the lack of reciprocity and has discussed it with her partner. She's not forcing him to do anything; she's choosing to stop giving oral sex because she's not getting the same from him. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel their needs are met. If one partner is making an effort but the other isn't, it can lead to resentment. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate might be seen as prioritizing his own pleasure over hers, which the author finds unfair. The fact that he changed his reason from a past trauma to just not liking it might have made her feel lied to or manipulated. \n\nThe author's decision to stop giving blowjobs is a form of self-respect and setting boundaries. She's not in the wrong for asserting her needs, especially after open communication. Relationships require mutual effort and consideration. If both parties aren't willing to compromise or meet each other's needs, it can lead to issues. The author is choosing to prioritize her own well-being and satisfaction, which is a valid stance.\n\nHowever, there's a consideration about whether withholding a sexual act is a form of punishment or fair negotiation. Some might argue that stopping blowjobs could be seen as a tit-for-tat, but in this context, she's doing it because she's not getting reciprocal pleasure. The decision is based on her own dissatisfaction and the lack of willingness from the other side to adjust. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial excuse versus the current one is a point of contention. The author had accepted the first reason but found out later that he's just being selfish. That could be a breach of trust, leading to her anger and subsequent actions. \n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, the author isn't violating any moral standards by setting boundaries. She's addressing an imbalance in the relationship. The boyfriend's behavior, on the other hand, might be the issue here. The author's actions stem from a place of seeking equality and respect in the relationship, which are fundamental in any healthy partnership.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's taking a stance for her own needs and has communicated her concerns. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate is the root problem. Therefore, the correct answer would be B.\n"
