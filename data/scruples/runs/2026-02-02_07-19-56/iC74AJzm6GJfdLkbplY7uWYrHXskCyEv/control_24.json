I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs to her boyfriend because he doesn't reciprocate with oral sex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 21-year-old female in a two-year relationship. Her boyfriend told her initially that he didn't like giving oral due to a bad experience. However, over time, he only did it 8 times, and now he says he doesn't like it because he \"gets nothing out of it.\" She's upset because she feels her pleasure is secondary and she's stopped giving him blowjobs unless it's reciprocated.\n\nSo, key points here are mutual respect and reciprocity in a relationship. The author was initially understanding of his past issue but after two years, he's not making an effort. He changed his reason from a past trauma to just not liking it for personal gain. She's now setting a boundary by stopping oral sex unless he reciprocates. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are important. The author has communicated her feelings and is seeking reciprocity. The boyfriend's lack of effort in reciprocating might be an issue. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on mutual respect. If one partner is only focused on their own pleasure, that can be a problem. \n\nBut I need to be careful not to assume one-sidedness. Maybe the boyfriend has other reasons not mentioned? However, he did change his excuse from a past experience to a selfish one, which could indicate he isn't being truthful. The author's response is about wanting equal effort in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's advocating for her needs and setting healthy boundaries when her partner isn't meeting them.\n"
