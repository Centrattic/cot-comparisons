I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a two-year relationship where the boyfriend doesn't give oral sex, and the author stops giving him blowjobs in response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend initially had a reason (bad experience), but now says he just doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels it's unfair because she reciprocates by giving him oral, and she's not getting the same. She stops giving him blowjobs as a result.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. Both partners should feel their needs are met. The boyfriend changed his reason from a past issue to personal preference, which the author found misleading. She's now taking a stand by stopping oral sex unless it's reciprocated. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to communicate their needs and find a middle ground. The author is expressing her dissatisfaction and trying to address the imbalance. Stopping oral sex as a form of protest might be seen as a reaction, but it's part of her asserting her needs. Neither side is entirely in the wrong, but the question is whether the author specifically is in the wrong.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the action of stopping blowjobs is justified. Since she's trying to get reciprocal pleasure and the boyfriend isn't meeting her needs, her decision might be seen as justified. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
