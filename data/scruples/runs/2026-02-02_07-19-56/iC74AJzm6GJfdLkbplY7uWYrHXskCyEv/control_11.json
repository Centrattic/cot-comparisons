I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering stopping giving blowjobs because her boyfriend doesn't reciprocate with oral sex.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend initially gave a reason for not giving oral sex (a bad experience), but now he says it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. She feels this is selfish and that oral should be reciprocal. She's angry about being treated like her pleasure is secondary and has stopped giving blowjobs as a result.\n\nI need to consider if she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, consent, and mutual respect in the relationship. The author has tried to address the issue by asking him and then deciding to stop reciprocating unless there's compromise. She's not threatening to end the relationship immediately but is setting boundaries.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel their needs are respected. If one partner is consistently not meeting the other's sexual needs without valid reasons, it's a problem. The boyfriend's change in excuse from a past trauma to just not liking it might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The author's decision to stop giving blowjobs as a form of reciprocation is a boundary she's setting to prioritize her own comfort and needs.\n\nIt's important to note that both partners have the right to express their boundaries and needs. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's addressing a two-year issue and seeking reciprocity. The boyfriend's lack of willingness to meet her halfway might be the root issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting her needs, even if it risks some tension. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
