I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a two-year relationship where the boyfriend doesn't give vaginal oral as much as the author would like, and now she's considering stopping giving him blowjobs because he's not reciprocating.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend initially had an excuse (smelly vag) but later admitted it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels she's been lied to and is now stopping oral because she's not getting reciprocal pleasure. She's planning to bring it up again and might end the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nSo, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The main factors here are communication, consent, and mutual satisfaction in a relationship. Both partners have the right to express their needs and boundaries. The boyfriend changed his reason from a past bad experience to just not getting pleasure, which the author found misleading. She's now choosing to stop reciprocating because she's not getting emotional or physical satisfaction from her actions. \n\nIn relationships, reciprocity is important for both partners to feel valued. If one partner is consistently not meeting the other's needs in a key area, it's a valid concern. The author isn't being selfish by seeking mutual respect and reciprocity. She's communicating her feelings, which is healthy. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate might stem from personal preferences, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she's overreacting by stopping oral entirely, but given the context of the relationship and the lack of reciprocity, it's her right to prioritize her needs. The decision to stop might lead to tension, but it's a consequence of the boyfriend's unmet obligation to communicate and compromise. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's asserting her needs and seeking a balanced relationship, which is valid.\n"
