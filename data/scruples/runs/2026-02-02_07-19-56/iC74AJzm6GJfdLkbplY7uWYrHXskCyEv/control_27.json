I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs to her boyfriend because he doesn't reciprocate by giving her oral sex.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together for two years. The boyfriend initially said he didn't want to give oral due to a bad experience. But over time, he only did it 8 times. The author recently found out that his real reason is that he doesn't enjoy it, not because of the initial excuse. She feels she's being selfishly treated, as she reciprocates but he doesn't. She stops giving him blowjobs now and is considering ending the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nSo, the core issue is about reciprocity in sexual activities. The author feels her needs are not being met, and she's taking action. Is she in the wrong?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both partners should express their needs and be open to compromise. The boyfriend didn't communicate his true feelings initially, leading the author to believe there was a valid reason. When she confronted him, he admitted it's because he doesn't get pleasure from it, which she finds selfish. \n\nThe author is now asserting her needs by stopping oral sex. Some might argue that she's being retaliatory, but others might see it as standing up for her own needs. It's important to consider that mutual respect and satisfaction are crucial in a relationship. If one partner is not fulfilling the other's needs without valid reasons, it can lead to resentment. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial lack of honesty and his current stance might be problematic. The author's decision to stop giving blowjobs is her way of seeking reciprocity. Whether she's in the wrong depends on cultural or personal values, but from a fairness standpoint, she's not wrong for addressing her unmet needs.\n"
