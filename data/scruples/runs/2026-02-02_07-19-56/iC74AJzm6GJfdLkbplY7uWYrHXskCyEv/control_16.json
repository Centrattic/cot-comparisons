I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is also 21. The main issue is that he doesn't perform oral sex on her. Initially, he gave an excuse about a bad experience with a smelly vagina, which made her accept it without pushing. But over two years, he only did it eight times, so rarely that she almost forgot he could. Then, when his friends were talking about doing it often, she felt hurt and asked if there was something wrong with her. He admitted it's not about her, but that he just doesn't get pleasure from it and is being selfish. Now the author has stopped giving him blowjobs because she's tired of the one-sidedness, and she's considering not doing it again unless he reciprocates. She's upset about being lied to and feeling her pleasure is secondary.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical and relational aspects here. The key points are lack of reciprocity, the boyfriend's initial dishonesty (changing his reason after two years), and the author's decision to stop performing oral sex as a form of compromise.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and satisfaction are important. If one partner is not fulfilling the other's needs, it can lead to resentment. The boyfriend's behavior of not going down on her for most of the relationship and not being honest about his reasons could be seen as neglecting her needs. The author felt that since she's doing something for him (giving him blowjobs), he should reciprocate. That seems fair because relationships often involve give and take.\n\nThe boyfriend's original excuse was a past bad experience, but later he admitted it's just that he doesn't get pleasure from it. That could be a valid reason, but the fact that he only tried eight times in two years might indicate that he's not making an effort. The author might feel that this is not a valid reason to ignore her needs, especially since she's willing to give oral but he isn't. \n\nThe author's response of stopping blowjobs could be seen as a form of protest or negotiation. By withholding a sexual act she's willing to do, she's trying to get him to reciprocate. This can be a healthy form of communication if done respectfully. However, it's important to consider if this action is a reasonable compromise or if it's being used as a punishment tactic. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the problem is about the lack of reciprocity and the boyfriend's dishonesty, then the author's actions are in response to those issues. She's trying to address an imbalance in the relationship, which is a valid concern. The boyfriend's initial misrepresentation of his reasons might have led her to not push as hard as she could have. Now that she's aware of the true reason, she's taking steps to ensure mutual satisfaction. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that people have different sexual preferences, and it's not always about reciprocity. If the boyfriend is asexual towards oral sex or genuinely doesn't enjoy it, the author might need to accept that or find other ways to meet each other's needs. But the author is not just accepting; she's trying to enforce reciprocity as a compromise. \n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of communication and the imbalance in their sexual relationship. The author had the right to ask for reciprocity, especially since she felt she was making an effort without getting anything in return. The boyfriend's dishonesty about his reasons for not performing oral sex adds to the problem. \n\nTherefore, the author's decision to stop giving blowjobs is a reasonable step to address the unfair dynamic. She's not in the wrong because she's standing up for her needs and expecting mutual respect and effort in the relationship. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
