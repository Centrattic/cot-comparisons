I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping oral sex in their relationship because their boyfriend isn't reciprocating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together for two years. The boyfriend initially had an excuse about not liking oral due to a past experience, but now he says he just doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish and stops giving him oral, which leads to potential conflict.\n\nThe main points to consider are consent, communication, and reciprocity in a relationship. The author is trying to address their own needs and set boundaries. They've communicated their feelings and are seeking reciprocity. The boyfriend's change in excuse from a past trauma to just not wanting to reciprocate might indicate he's not prioritizing her needs equally.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel respected and their needs met. If one partner is consistently not meeting the other's expectations without valid reasons, it's a problem. The author is standing up for themselves, which is important. They're not forcing the boyfriend to do anything, but setting a boundary about their own actions. \n\nHowever, there's a potential for imbalance if the author stops oral without considering other forms of intimacy or problem-solving together. But given the boyfriend's lack of reciprocity and the author's distress, setting a boundary seems reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author is addressing their needs and seeking equality in the relationship, which is not being wrong.\n"
