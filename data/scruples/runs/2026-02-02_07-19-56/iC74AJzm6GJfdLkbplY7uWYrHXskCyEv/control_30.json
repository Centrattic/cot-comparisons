I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple's sexual dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author (21F) is in a two-year relationship. Her boyfriend (21M) rarely gives her oral sex, giving a past bad experience as the reason. Now, he admits he just doesn't like doing it because he \"gets nothing out of it,\" which the author finds selfish. She's angry he's been dishonest and feels her pleasure is secondary. She's stopped giving him blowjobs as a response and plans to discuss it again, possibly ending oral sex unless there's reciprocity.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The boyfriend changed his reason from a past issue to personal preference. The author felt lied to and is now taking action by withholding oral sex. She's using this as a form of negotiation to encourage reciprocity.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. If one partner isn't fulfilling the other's needs, communication is crucial. The author is addressing her dissatisfaction and setting boundaries. While it's a personal choice, if the boyfriend isn't reciprocating, it's reasonable for her to express her needs. However, withholding intimacy can be seen as a form of punishment, which might not be healthy. But given the context of the boyfriend's dishonesty and the lack of reciprocity, the author's actions are a response to being treated unfairly.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's addressing her own needs and seeking mutual respect, it's more about her right to have her needs met. The boyfriend's initial dishonesty and the lack of reciprocity are issues on his part. The author is taking a stand, which is valid. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
