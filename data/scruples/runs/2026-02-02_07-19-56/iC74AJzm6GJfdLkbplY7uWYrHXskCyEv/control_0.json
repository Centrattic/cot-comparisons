I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's been in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. He doesn't go down on her much, only eight times in two years, and he initially gave an excuse about a bad experience with a smelly vagina. Later, he admitted it's just that he doesn't get anything out of it. She's upset because she feels it's selfish and she reciprocates by giving him oral sex. Now she's stopped giving him blowjobs because she's tired of feeling like her pleasure is secondary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a healthy relationship. Mutual respect and communication are key. The author tried to communicate her feelings when she noticed his lack of reciprocation. He changed his reason from a past experience to not getting anything out of it. That might have made her feel like he was hiding his true feelings, which could be a valid reason for her frustration. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners should feel valued and their needs should be considered. If one partner isn't willing to meet the other's needs because they don't benefit from it, that could be seen as a lack of reciprocity. The author is now withholding oral sex as a way to make him reciprocate, which is a form of negotiation. \n\nBut is she in the wrong for doing that? It depends on the perspective. Some might say that making a demand for reciprocity is fair, especially if there's a power imbalance in the sexual dynamics. Others might argue that she should have addressed the issue earlier or that her response could harm the relationship. However, the fact that she's communicating her needs and setting boundaries might be justified, given that he's not meeting her needs. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior might be selfish, as he's not considering her pleasure. The author's decision to stop is a way to enforce mutual respect. In this case, she might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
