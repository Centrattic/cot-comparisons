I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a two-year relationship where the boyfriend doesn't give oral sex as much as the author would like. The boyfriend initially had an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted he just doesn't like it because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels the relationship is unbalanced and stops giving blowjobs in response. She's considering ending the relationship if it doesn't change.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did communicate her feelings, and the boyfriend was honest about his reasons. But the author feels she's being treated as if her pleasure is secondary, which is a valid concern. Reciprocity in intimacy is important for many people, so if one partner isn't meeting the other's needs, it can create tension. The boyfriend's admission that he's not willing to reciprocate as much as she expects might be the root of the problem.\n\nThe author's decision to stop giving blowjobs as a form of reciprocation seems like a stand to enforce mutual respect and balance. But is this fair? It depends on the context. If the boyfriend isn't willing to compromise or find a middle ground, the author is asserting her needs. However, communication should ideally involve finding solutions rather than ultimatums. The author might be in the right in seeking balance, but maybe the approach could have been different. However, the boyfriend's refusal to meet her halfway might justify her stance. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs in a relationship where reciprocity is expected.\n"
