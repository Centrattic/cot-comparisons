I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to stop giving blowjobs if her boyfriend doesn't reciprocate with oral sex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a two-year relationship where she's been giving her boyfriend oral sex frequently, but he only reciprocates about 8 times in two years. Initially, he said it was due to a bad experience, but later admitted he just doesn't enjoy it and doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels her pleasure is secondary, and after realizing this, she's decided to stop giving blowjobs unless it's reciprocal. She's planning to confront him again, and if he doesn't comply, the relationship might be in trouble.\n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. Sexual practices and reciprocity can be a sensitive topic. The author is expressing her dissatisfaction and choosing to stop an act that she feels is one-sided. She's not just acting on impulse but has communicated her feelings and given him multiple chances to adjust. His reluctance seems to stem from personal preference rather than a valid reason, like a medical issue or trauma that she's accommodating.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships thrive on mutual understanding and compromise. If one partner's needs are consistently unmet, it's reasonable to seek a balance. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's addressing a recurring issue that affects her well-being. His lack of willingness to compromise could be the bigger issue here. However, the decision to stop a sexual act might affect the relationship dynamics, but it's her right to prioritize her own satisfaction and communicate her boundaries.\n\nSo, considering that the author has tried to communicate and the boyfriend isn't meeting her needs reciprocally, she's not in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer should be B, No.\n"
