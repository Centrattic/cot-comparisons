I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. He doesn't give her oral sex and has only done it eight times in two years. He initially gave an excuse about a bad experience (smelly vag), but now he says he just doesn't get anything out of it. The author is upset because she feels her pleasure is secondary. She stopped giving him blowjobs and is considering cutting them off unless he reciprocates. The question is, is she in the wrong?\n\nFirst, let's consider consent and mutual satisfaction in a relationship. Healthy relationships require both partners to feel satisfied and respected. If one partner is consistently not fulfilling the other's needs without valid reasons, that could be a problem. The boyfriend changed his excuse from a past trauma to just not wanting to reciprocate. The author felt lied to, which adds to the tension. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior might be selfish if he's only focused on his own pleasure. The author's response is to stop giving blowjobs as a form of protest. Is that fair? Well, if both partners are supposed to reciprocate, then the author's demand for reciprocation makes sense. She's not just stopping for revenge but because she values mutual pleasure. \n\nHowever, communication is key. The author did talk to him again, and if he refuses to compromise, then the situation is out of her hands. But the initial act of stopping blowjobs could be seen as a consequence for his behavior, not just a selfish act. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that stopping oral sex could be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip. But in this case, the author is trying to establish mutual respect and reciprocity, which is a valid relationship standard. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the relationship requires mutual effort and the other person isn't meeting their partner's needs, then the author's actions are justified. She's addressing a legitimate concern in the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
