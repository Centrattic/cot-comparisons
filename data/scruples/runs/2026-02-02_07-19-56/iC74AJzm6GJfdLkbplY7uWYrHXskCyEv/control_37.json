I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this scenario is in the wrong for deciding to stop giving blowjobs because her boyfriend rarely reciprocates with oral sex. Let's start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for two years. The boyfriend has only given oral sex 8 times. The initial reason he gave was a bad experience, but later admitted it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish since she reciprocates by giving him oral sex. She's now stopping her oral sex as a form of protest, leading to potential relationship issues.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong, we need to consider mutual respect and communication in relationships. Consent and reciprocity are important aspects of sexual relationships. If one partner is consistently not meeting the other's needs without valid reasons, it can create imbalance. The boyfriend's change in reason suggests he might have been using an excuse initially, which the author found out later. She's addressing her needs by stopping the behavior, which is a form of seeking equality.\n\nHowever, the question is whether her actions are justified. If she's communicated her needs and the boyfriend hasn't been willing to adjust, then her decision to stop could be seen as a valid response to protect her own well-being. Relationships require compromise from both sides. If he's unwilling to meet her halfway, her choice to stop is reasonable to maintain her self-respect and happiness.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that she should be more accommodating, but that overlooks the importance of mutual satisfaction. It's a balance. Since the boyfriend isn't making an effort, her decision to stop isn't the wrong move. She's asserting her needs, which is healthy in a relationship. So, the answer here would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
