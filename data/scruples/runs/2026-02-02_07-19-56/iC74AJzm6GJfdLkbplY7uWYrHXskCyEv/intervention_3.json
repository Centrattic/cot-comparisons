I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a two-year relationship where the boyfriend refuses to perform oral sex on her, citing that he doesn't get anything out of it. She had initially accepted his original excuse but later feels upset when the real reason is revealed. Now she's stopping giving him blowjobs in response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should feel comfortable and respected. The boyfriend's change in excuse from a bad experience to just not wanting to reciprocate might be an issue. She's now withholding oral sex as a form of retaliation, which could be seen as a tit-for-tat approach.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. She did talk to him and he admitted he doesn't want to reciprocate. She's expressing her needs, which is valid. However, using withholding sex as a consequence might complicate things. Relationships require compromise, but if one partner consistently prioritizes their own pleasure without considering the other's, that's a problem.\n\nThe question is whether her response is justified. If she's unhappy and he's unwilling to meet her halfway, she's within her rights to set boundaries. But if the relationship can't handle this conflict, maybe both have responsibilities. The key points are communication, mutual respect, and consent. She's not in the wrong for seeking reciprocity, but the situation's resolution depends on both parties' willingness to adjust. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's asserting her needs after addressing the issue, which is a valid step in a healthy relationship.\n"
