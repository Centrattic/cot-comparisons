I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a romantic relationship where the woman is upset because her boyfriend doesn't give her oral sex, and she's considering stopping giving him blowjobs as a result.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The boyfriend initially gave an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish, especially since she reciprocates by giving him oral sex. She's angry that her pleasure is being prioritized below his, and now she's threatening to stop unless he changes his behavior.\n\nFrom the woman's perspective, she's setting boundaries because her needs aren't being met. She's tried discussing it, and now she's considering a reciprocal action to get her needs met. But is this fair? The boyfriend isn't forcing her to do anything; he's just not engaging in an act she wants. However, she's now choosing not to engage in something he might want, which could be seen as a tit-for-tat approach. \n\nBut wait, she mentions that the main issue is the lack of reciprocity. She's giving him oral sex but he's not giving her the same. She's feeling used because she's not getting the same in return. In that case, her decision to stop could be a way to balance the relationship. However, the method of stopping without a compromise might lead to conflict. \n\nBut the question is if she's in the wrong. The key points are mutual respect and communication. If she's not getting her needs met and has tried to address it, then stopping the behavior could be a valid choice. However, if the boyfriend's reasons are genuine (he doesn't enjoy it), maybe her expectation is unrealistic. But she's arguing that oral should be about mutual pleasure, not just one side. \n\nAnother angle: the woman is taking a stand for her own pleasure, which is important. In healthy relationships, both partners should feel their needs are considered. If the boyfriend isn't willing to compromise, maybe the woman is justified in her actions. \n\nOn the other hand, if the woman suddenly stops giving oral without a clear discussion, it might come as a shock. She mentions planning to bring it up again, so maybe she's trying to work through it. However, threatening to stop could be seen as a punishment, which might not be fair. But given the context, she's standing up for herself after feeling unappreciated. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's advocating for her needs. The initial excuse was a lie, and now she's trying to establish mutual respect. Her actions, while they might cause tension, are about seeking fairness.\n"
