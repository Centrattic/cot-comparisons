I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend doesn't give oral sex, and the author stops giving him blowjobs as a result. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend initially had a bad experience (smelly vag) as a reason for not giving oral. Over two years, he only did it 8 times. The author asked if there was something wrong, and he changed his reason to not liking it because he gets nothing out of it. The author feels it's selfish and reciprocates by stopping blowjobs. Now she's considering ending the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I need to consider consent, communication, and mutual respect in relationships. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial excuse was a past experience, but later he admitted it's because he doesn't enjoy it. The author values reciprocity and feels her pleasure is secondary. She's communicating her needs, which is reasonable. Stopping oral is her way of seeking balance. The boyfriend isn't meeting her needs, so she's asserting herself. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should strive for mutual satisfaction. If one partner's needs are consistently neglected, the other has the right to set boundaries. The author is not being selfish; she's addressing a long-standing issue. The boyfriend's lack of willingness to reciprocate is the key issue here. The author's actions are a response to his behavior. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for herself after years of imbalance. The boyfriend's refusal to give oral without valid reasons is the main problem. The author's decision to stop blowjobs is a valid attempt to seek equality. So the answer should be B.\n"
