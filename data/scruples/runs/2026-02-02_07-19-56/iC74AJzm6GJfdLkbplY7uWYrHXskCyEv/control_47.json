I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for stopping oral sex with her boyfriend because he rarely reciprocates. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend initially gave a reason (smelly vag) but later admitted it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels used and that her pleasure is secondary. She stops giving blowjobs and is considering ending the relationship if it's not reciprocated. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The boyfriend's initial excuse changed, which might indicate he wasn't honest. The author is now standing up for her needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. Reciprocity in intimacy is often expected, so her reaction is understandable. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If the boyfriend's actions (or lack thereof) are causing her distress and he's unwilling to compromise, then his actions are problematic. The author's decision to stop oral sex is a form of seeking balance. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. If she's willing to stop giving blowjobs, but the boyfriend is unwilling to reciprocate, it might lead to conflict. But since he's admitted he doesn't want to reciprocate, her choice is about self-respect. \n\nI think the key here is whether the boyfriend's behavior is respectful of her needs. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, the author's decision is valid. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
