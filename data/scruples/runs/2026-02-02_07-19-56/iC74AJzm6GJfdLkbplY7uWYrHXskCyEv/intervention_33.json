I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for stopping oral sex in her relationship. \n\nFirst, the key points: The couple has been together for two years. The boyfriend says he doesn't like giving oral because of a past experience, but he's only done it 8 times. The author feels she's been lied to when he changed his excuse from a bad experience to just not enjoying it. She's now stopped giving him oral because she wants reciprocity and is upset about the lack of reciprocity in their sexual relationship.\n\nThe author's main argument is about fairness and mutual satisfaction in the relationship. She's feeling that her needs aren't being met, and she's trying to address it by stopping an activity she's uncomfortable with. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate is making her feel unappreciated. \n\nI need to consider if her decision is justified. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If one partner is consistently not meeting the other's needs, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. The author is trying to address the imbalance by stopping an act she's not getting anything out of. The boyfriend's initial excuse changed, which might indicate he's been dishonest or not fully transparent. \n\nThe ethical angle here is whether the author is justified in her actions given the lack of reciprocity. If the boyfriend is prioritizing his own pleasure and not meeting her needs, her decision to stop could be seen as a self-respecting move. Also, considering that she's communicated her feelings and is planning to discuss it again, she's trying to find a solution rather than just causing conflict.\n\nHowever, some might argue that stopping oral sex could damage the relationship, but the root issue is about mutual respect and satisfaction. If the boyfriend isn't willing to compromise, then the author is standing up for her own needs. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the author is not in the wrong. She's addressing a valid concern about reciprocity and trying to balance the relationship. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
