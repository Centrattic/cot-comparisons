I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend refuses to give oral sex, citing that he \"gets nothing out of it,\" which the author finds selfish. She stops giving him blowjobs as a form of protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The boyfriend initially gave a different reason (smelly vag) but later admitted it's just that he doesn't like it. The author feels her pleasure is being neglected and decides to stop reciprocating. The question is whether she's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, mutual respect and communication are key. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling a sexual act that the author values, and she's expressing her dissatisfaction by stopping an act she's doing for him. It's a matter of reciprocity and consent. The author's decision to stop is a form of negotiation to encourage mutual satisfaction. \n\nHowever, some might argue that stopping an act of affection could be seen as a manipulation tactic or a breach of commitment. But in this context, the author is seeking equality in the relationship. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate might be the root issue here. Since both parties have the right to their preferences, but also a responsibility to meet each other's needs within the relationship, the author's action could be justified as a means to address imbalance. \n\nSo, considering that the author is advocating for her own needs and trying to establish mutual respect, the answer would lean towards her not being in the wrong. The key point is whether the action is a reasonable response to a perceived imbalance. Since she's communicating her needs and setting boundaries, it's a valid step in seeking a balanced relationship.\n"
