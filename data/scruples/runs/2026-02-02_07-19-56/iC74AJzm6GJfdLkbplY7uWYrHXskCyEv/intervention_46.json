I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend isn't reciprocating oral sex. The author stopped giving blowjobs because he wasn't giving her head, and now she's considering ending the relationship over it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend initially gave a reason (bad experience) but later changed his stance, saying he doesn't get anything out of oral. The author feels upset and angry because she's been doing it for him but he's not returning the favor. She stopped giving him oral and is threatening to end the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate that. From a relationship perspective, communication and mutual respect are key. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity could be a problem. If both partners are supposed to fulfill each other's needs, not reciprocating might lead to resentment. The author tried to address the issue, was honest about her feelings, and is now setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. If she stops giving him oral, is that fair? Well, if he's not willing to reciprocate, maybe she's justified in protecting her own needs. The boyfriend's initial excuse changed, which might indicate he wasn't being honest. The author might be right in feeling that her pleasure is secondary. \n\nOn the other hand, stopping all oral sex could be a significant change. But if the boyfriend isn't willing to compromise, maybe the author is right to prioritize her own satisfaction. The key here is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response to a lack of reciprocity in the relationship. \n\nIn terms of moral rightness, if the boyfriend isn't meeting her needs and refuses to change, she's probably not in the wrong for asserting her boundaries. The user thinks she's wrong, but from a relationship dynamics standpoint, mutual satisfaction is important. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The user's perspective might be that she should try to work it out more, but if the boyfriend isn't willing to meet her halfway, her actions are justified.\n"
