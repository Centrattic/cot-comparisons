I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping oral sex because her boyfriend isn't reciprocating. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been in a two-year relationship. The boyfriend initially said he didn't like giving oral due to a bad experience but later admitted he just doesn't enjoy it. The author feels it's selfish, especially since she does it for him and he isn't doing it for her. She's now stopping oral as a form of protest, leading to potential relationship issues.\n\nSo, consent and mutual respect are key here. The boyfriend isn't refusing oral entirely, just not doing it often. But the author feels this is a lack of reciprocity. She's taking a stand for her own pleasure, which is valid. However, she's using withholding oral as a leverage. Is that fair?\n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is crucial. The author did communicate her feelings, and the boyfriend didn't change his behavior. She's now taking action to protect her own needs. But does that make her in the wrong? Or is the boyfriend the one being inconsiderate by not meeting her needs?\n\nSexual preferences vary, but the key is mutual satisfaction. If one partner's needs aren't being met, it's a problem. The author's decision to stop oral is her right, but might affect the relationship. However, the root issue is the lack of reciprocity and respect for her pleasure. The boyfriend's initial lie and then admitting selfishness shows a pattern of not prioritizing her needs.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for herself after feeling neglected. The real issue is the boyfriend's lack of effort to reciprocate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
