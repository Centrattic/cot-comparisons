I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation she described. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend doesn't perform oral sex as much as she'd like, and she stops giving blowjobs in response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author (21F) is in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend (21M). He initially had an excuse about a bad experience leading to not performing oral sex, but later admitted he just \"gets nothing out of it,\" meaning it doesn't pleasure him. The author feels used because she gives him oral sex often but he doesn't reciprocate. She's angry about being lied to and now stops giving him blowjobs as a form of protest. She's considering bringing it up again and possibly ending the relationship if there's no compromise.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but the user wants to know my opinion.\n\nSo, to evaluate this, I need to consider mutual respect and communication in relationships. The boyfriend changed his reason from a past trauma to just not enjoying it. That could be seen as misleading. The author felt her pleasure was secondary, which is a valid concern in a relationship where both partners should feel valued. However, when she stops giving blowjobs in response, is that fair?\n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, communication is key. The author did communicate her feelings and tried to understand his reasons. He wasn't honest initially. The author's response is to reciprocate by stopping her oral sex as a way to enforce balance. While it's her right to express her needs, using the withholding of pleasure as a form of punishment might not be the healthiest approach. However, she's also acting on her own discomfort and the realization that her partner wasn't truthful.\n\nThe question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the boyfriend was not fulfilling her needs and was dishonest, then the author's actions could be justified as standing up for her own needs. However, if she's cutting off a mutual activity as retaliation without seeking compromise, that might be seen as reactive. But in the context of the boyfriend's lack of reciprocity and dishonesty, her actions might be seen as a reasonable boundary.\n\nIn many relationship dynamics, both partners should feel their needs are met. If one partner is consistently prioritizing their own pleasure over the other's, it's an issue. The author's decision to stop giving blowjobs is a way to assert her boundaries. While it could strain the relationship, it's her way of saying her pleasure matters too. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, the method of response (withholding oral sex) is a form of punishment that might not be ideal. But given the context, it's a boundary-setting action rather than being in the wrong.\n"
