I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong for stopping blowjobs if her boyfriend isn't reciprocating. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend has only performed oral sex on her eight times in two years, using an initial excuse about a bad experience. Later, he changes his reason to not getting anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish since she reciprocates, and she's now stopping giving him oral sex. \n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics and communication. The boyfriend's behavior seems inconsistent. Initially, he had an excuse related to a past experience, then shifted to personal preference. The author felt neglected and tried to address it, leading to her decision to stop reciprocating.\n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity could be a valid concern for the author. However, the author is taking a stance by stopping her oral sex as a form of protest. This could be seen as using a sexual act as leverage, which might not be the healthiest approach, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n\nBut the author also mentions feeling lied to because his reasons changed. She's addressing a legitimate issue of imbalance. Stopping oral sex could be her way of enforcing reciprocity, which is a personal choice. However, whether this action is right or wrong might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about sexual compromise in relationships.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if her actions are justified. The author is reacting to a perceived injustice in the relationship. While using a sexual act as a bargaining chip can be problematic, the root issue of lack of reciprocity might make her stance understandable. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), as the author is addressing a valid concern about respect and equality in the relationship, even if the method is contentious.\n"
