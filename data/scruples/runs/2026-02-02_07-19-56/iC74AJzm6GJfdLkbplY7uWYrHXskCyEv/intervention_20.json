I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one partner isn't reciprocating oral sex, leading the other to stop giving blowjobs in return.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman (21F) mentions that her boyfriend (21M) has only given her oral sex 8 times in two years, citing a past bad experience as the reason. Initially, she accepted his excuse, but later he admitted it's because he \"gets nothing out of it,\" which she finds selfish. She then stops giving him oral sex to reciprocate, leading to potential relationship issues.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and consent. The boyfriend changed his reason from a past trauma to not enjoying it, which the woman feels is a lie. She's upset that he didn't communicate truthfully, making her question her own worth. Her decision to stop giving blowjobs is a form of reciprocal action, but she's worried about damaging the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if her actions are justified. In relationships, mutual respect and communication are crucial. If the boyfriend is being dishonest about his feelings or not considering her needs, then her response might be a way to address the imbalance. However, stopping an activity that the partner enjoys (blowjobs) could be seen as a punishment, which might not resolve the underlying issues.\n\nBut, considering the boyfriend's lack of reciprocity and the woman's efforts to communicate, her decision to stop might be a valid attempt to seek equality. It's about balancing personal boundaries and ensuring both partners feel valued. If the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise, then the woman's actions might be justified in asserting her needs.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the boyfriend was being selfish and not meeting her needs, her response could be justified. However, using the withholding of a sexual act as leverage might not be the best approach, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to a perceived imbalance. Therefore, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
