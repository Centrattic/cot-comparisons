I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author is a woman in a two-year relationship. Her boyfriend has only given her oral sex 8 times. Initially, he said it was because of a bad experience (smelly vagina), but later changed his reason to not liking it because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels that oral should be reciprocal since she does it for him. She's now stopped giving him blowjobs because she's tired of doing it without reciprocity. She's planning to bring it up again and might end the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Communication is key in relationships, especially around intimacy. The boyfriend changed his reason over time, which the author feels is being dishonest. The author is asserting her needs now, which is a common step in relationships when boundaries or expectations shift.\n\nIs it fair for the boyfriend to not reciprocate oral sex? The author argues that oral should be mutual. From a relationship health perspective, mutual satisfaction is important. If one person is consistently giving and not receiving, that can create imbalance and resentment. The author's anger stems from feeling that her pleasure is secondary, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial excuse was a past experience, but he later admitted it's just that he doesn't enjoy it. That shift might indicate he was hiding his true feelings, which could be a communication issue. The author is now responding by withholding oral, which is her right to set boundaries.\n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. The author is threatening to end the relationship if he doesn't change, which is a significant decision. But if the relationship is causing her distress and he's unwilling to meet her needs, maybe that's a sign the relationship isn't healthy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's standing up for her needs, which is a positive step. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity could be seen as selfish, as she points out. The wrong here might be on the boyfriend's side for not being honest from the start or for not considering her feelings. But the question is about the author's actions. She's stopping an activity she's done before, which is her choice. If he's causing her distress by not meeting her needs, she's justified in setting boundaries. So the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
