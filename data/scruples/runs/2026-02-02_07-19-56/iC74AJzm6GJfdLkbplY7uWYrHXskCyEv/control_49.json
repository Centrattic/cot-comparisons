I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping blowjobs. The situation is about a two-year relationship where the boyfriend doesn't reciprocate oral sex. Initially, he had an excuse about a bad experience, but now he admits it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels used and wants reciprocity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual respect. The author is addressing a valid concern about unequal treatment in the bedroom. The boyfriend's initial excuse was a bad past experience, but later he changes it to personal preference. That shift might feel like a lie, leading to the author's frustration. \n\nReciprocity in sex is important for many people. If one partner is consistently giving without receiving, it can create resentment. The author is taking a stand by stopping oral to get the same in return. That's a form of communication about their needs. \n\nBut relationships require communication and compromise. The author is planning to discuss it again. If they can't reach a compromise, maybe the relationship isn't balanced. However, stopping intimate acts can be a big move. It's a way to enforce boundaries, which is okay if done respectfully.\n\nIs the author wrong? In the context of needing mutual satisfaction, probably not. The boyfriend isn't meeting her needs, so she's setting a boundary. The key is whether the author is acting out of a place of fairness and communication. She's not being cruel, just asserting her needs. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
