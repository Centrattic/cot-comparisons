I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend refuses to give oral sex, and the author stops giving him blowjobs in return. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The boyfriend initially gave an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted it's because he \"gets nothing out of it.\" The author is upset because they feel their pleasure is secondary. She stops giving him blowjobs as a form of reciprocity.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to address the issue directly after being upset by his friends' comments. The boyfriend's change in reasoning from a past experience to selfishness might have caused the author to feel lied to. The author's decision to stop oral sex is a response to the lack of reciprocity.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, everyone has different boundaries and expectations. The author is asserting her needs by stopping oral sex, which is a personal choice. However, relationships require compromise. If she stops without trying to find a middle ground, it could lead to conflict. But the boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate might be the root issue here.\n\nThe key points are: the boyfriend's lack of reciprocity, the author's communication attempts, and the mutual adjustment in intimacy. The author isn't being selfish; she's addressing her unmet needs. The boyfriend's initial excuse was later revealed as a cop-out, so the author's reaction is understandable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs and the boyfriend's behavior is the issue. She's trying to communicate and find a solution, which is reasonable.\n"
