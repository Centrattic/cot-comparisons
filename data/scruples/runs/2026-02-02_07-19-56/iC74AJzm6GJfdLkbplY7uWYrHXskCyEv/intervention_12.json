I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping blowjobs in her relationship because her boyfriend doesn't reciprocate with oral sex. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend initially gave a reason (a bad experience) for not giving oral, but later admitted he just doesn't like it because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish, especially since she regularly gives him oral. She's now stopping her oral to reciprocate, which could potentially damage the relationship.\n\nI need to consider consent, communication, and mutual respect. The boyfriend isn't forcing her to perform oral sex, so it's about their mutual agreement. The author is setting a boundary here, which is her right. However, the boyfriend's reasons might be valid for him, even if she finds them selfish. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is choosing to stop because she's not being treated fairly. If both partners aren't getting their needs met, then it's a valid concern. Her decision to stop might be a form of leverage to encourage reciprocation, which could be seen as a healthy boundary in a relationship where mutual respect is required.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author's actions are causing unnecessary harm or not allowing for open dialogue, that might be an issue. But the scenario suggests she's planning to talk to him again, so she's trying to communicate. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling her pleasure is secondary. In a relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. If one is consistently not meeting the other's expectations, it's a problem. So stopping oral sex to address this imbalance isn't necessarily wrong. It's about negotiating their sexual relationship in a way that's fair to both. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs and setting boundaries, which is important for a healthy relationship.\n"
