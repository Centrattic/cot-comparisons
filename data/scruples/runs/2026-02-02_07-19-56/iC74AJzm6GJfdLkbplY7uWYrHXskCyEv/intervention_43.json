I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for stopping blowjobs because her boyfriend isn't reciprocating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend. She says he doesn't go down on her, only 8 times in two years. Initially, he gave an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted he just doesn't like doing it because he doesn't get pleasure from it. She's angry because she feels it's selfish and has stopped giving him blowjobs, planning to continue unless he compromises.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, from a relationship ethics standpoint, communication and mutual respect are key. The boyfriend didn't disclose his true feelings about oral sex from the start, changing his story later. That lack of honesty could be an issue. The author, feeling her pleasure is secondary, is now deciding to stop reciprocating. \n\nIs it fair for her to stop giving blowjobs if he's not reciprocating? It depends on the value placed on reciprocity in a relationship. If both partners expect mutual satisfaction, then not reciprocating could be seen as unfair. However, the boyfriend's refusal to engage in an act she desires without adequate discussion might be the root problem. \n\nThe author's decision is based on feeling undervalued and wants to address the imbalance. If the boyfriend isn't willing to adjust, perhaps the author is justified in her actions. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner isn't meeting the other's needs, changes might be necessary. \n\nThe key points here are honesty from the boyfriend and the author's right to seek pleasure in the relationship. The boyfriend's change in excuse could be seen as dismissive of her needs. By stopping blowjobs, the author is trying to enforce reciprocity, which could be seen as a valid step in asserting her own needs. \n\nSo, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a cultural or ethical perspective I'm missing. In some views, oral sex might be considered optional, but if both partners expect mutual acts, then the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his part. The author's action is a response to that, which could be justified.\n"
