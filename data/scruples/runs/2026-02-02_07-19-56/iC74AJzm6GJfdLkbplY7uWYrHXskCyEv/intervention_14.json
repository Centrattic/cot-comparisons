I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for stopping giving blowjobs because her boyfriend isn't reciprocating. \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author is a 21-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is also 21. He initially gave an excuse about not liking giving oral due to a bad experience. Over two years, he only did it eight times. She recently confronted him after hearing his friends talk about giving head often, and he admitted he just doesn't like it because he doesn't get pleasure from it. She's upset because she feels her pleasure is secondary, and she's stopped giving blowjobs in response. She's planning to bring it up again and might end the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thought she might be, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nKey points to consider: Consent and communication are crucial in relationships. The author's boyfriend didn't reciprocate, which she found unfair. She tried to address it, but he didn't make an effort. The author felt she was being treated as if her pleasure was secondary, which is a valid concern. In healthy relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The boyfriend's refusal to compromise might be the issue here. The author's decision to stop giving blowjobs is a form of protest to encourage mutual respect and reciprocity.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she should have addressed this earlier or that stopping oral sex could be seen as a form of coercion. But given that she tried to communicate and he wasn't willing to meet her halfway, her stance seems reasonable. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one partner isn't willing to adjust, it's valid for the other to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of personal preferences. Oral sex might not be something everyone enjoys giving or receiving. But if one partner's preferences significantly affect the other's enjoyment and they're not willing to find a middle ground, it's a problem. The boyfriend's initial excuse was a bad experience, but later admitted it was about not getting pleasure from it, which is different. The author might feel she was misled initially.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is asserting her needs, which is important. If a relationship isn't meeting both partners' needs, it's reasonable to seek changes. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reciprocity. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
