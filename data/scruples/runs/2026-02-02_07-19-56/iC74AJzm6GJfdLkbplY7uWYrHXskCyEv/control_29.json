I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering stopping giving blowjobs if her boyfriend refuses to reciprocate with oral sex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a two-year relationship where her boyfriend has only given her oral sex 8 times. Initially, he gave an excuse about a bad experience, but later admitted it's because he doesn't get anything out of it. She's angry about the lack of reciprocity and has stopped giving him blowjobs in response. She's planning to bring it up again and might end the relationship if he doesn't compromise.\n\nNow, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect in the relationship. The boyfriend is choosing not to reciprocate an act that the author values. The author is setting boundaries based on her needs and the lack of reciprocity. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are met and respected. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocity could be seen as prioritizing his own pleasure over hers. The author's decision to stop an act she's uncomfortable with is a form of asserting her boundaries. It's important to note that both partners should communicate openly and make efforts to meet each other's needs unless there's a valid reason (medical, psychological, etc.) that can't be overcome. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial excuse changed, which made the author feel lied to. This change in reasoning could indicate dishonesty or a lack of willingness to address her needs. The author is now responding in kind by stopping an act she's doing for him. While this might cause tension, it's a way of expressing that her pleasure is important and should be mutual. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. If both parties can't meet in the middle, it might lead to issues. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. She's standing up for herself after feeling her needs were consistently ignored. The boyfriend's refusal to reciprocate, despite her communication, might make him the one in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, consent to stop an activity is valid. The author isn't forcing him to continue, but she's making a choice based on his behavior. It's about mutual respect and satisfaction. If one partner is consistently not meeting the other's needs without valid reasons, it's reasonable for the other to adjust their behavior. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's asserting her needs and boundaries in a relationship where reciprocity isn't happening. The boyfriend's lack of willingness to compromise might be the issue here.\n"
