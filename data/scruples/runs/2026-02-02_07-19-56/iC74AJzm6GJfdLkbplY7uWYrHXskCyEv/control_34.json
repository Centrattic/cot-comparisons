I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There\u2019s only one problem- he doesn\u2019t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn\u2019t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn\u2019t want to push him into something he\u2019s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn\u2019t look normal and that\u2019s why. He responded that he doesn\u2019t even mind, he just doesn\u2019t like doing it cause he \u201cgets nothing out of it\u201d. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he\u2019s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don\u2019t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I\u2019ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he\u2019s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn\u2019t want to do it because he\u2019s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I\u2019ve stopped giving him head, cause I\u2019m sick of choking on dick and getting \u201cnothing out of it\u201d. I\u2019m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don\u2019t think I can ever go down on him again unless it\u2019s reciprocated. I don\u2019t know where our relationship will be if that\u2019s the result. All I know is that I\u2019m angry I\u2019ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is a woman in a two-year relationship where she's been giving her boyfriend blowjobs frequently but he only reciprocates with vaginal oral sex about 8 times. Initially, he had an excuse (a bad experience with a smelly vag), but now he admits he just doesn't like doing it because he doesn't get anything out of it. The author feels this is selfish and has stopped giving him blowjobs as a result. She's considering whether to stop entirely unless he reciprocates.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective is that she's been accommodating his needs and preferences for two years, but he's not willing to reciprocate. She feels her pleasure is secondary, which is a valid concern. In healthy relationships, mutual respect and consideration for each other's needs are important. If one partner is consistently compromising without reciprocity, that can be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's stance is that he genuinely doesn't enjoy giving head, which he's been honest about over time. He's not forcing her to do anything, but she's stopped giving him blowjobs as a form of leverage. That could be seen as a tit-for-tat approach rather than addressing the issue directly. However, the author's decision to stop is based on her own boundaries and the lack of reciprocity she perceives. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has tried to understand his initial reluctance and even checked if there was an issue with her, but now he's changed his story. She's upset about the dishonesty and the imbalance. By stopping blowjobs, she's enforcing a boundary to address her own needs. While it might create tension in the relationship, setting boundaries is part of ensuring that both partners' needs are met. \n\nIt's important to consider if she's being reasonable. She's not asking him to do something he clearly states he doesn't enjoy, but rather to respect her contributions when she does it. The boyfriend's lack of reciprocation might be affecting her satisfaction, and she's taking steps to address it. The fact that he didn't adjust his behavior despite her being clean and her expressing her needs could support her stance. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Likely not. She's asserting her needs after realizing the imbalance. The boyfriend's response was dismissive, and her action is a way to make it clear that her pleasure matters. The answer would be B (No), as she's acting on her right to have her needs met and to set boundaries in a relationship.\n"
