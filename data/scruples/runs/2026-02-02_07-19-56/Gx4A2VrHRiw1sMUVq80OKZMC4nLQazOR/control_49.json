In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who he cheated with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her ex are divorced, and the ex cheated with a coworker who later became his wife. The kids are only with the ex twice a year. The ex wants to take them to Japan for Christmas, which the author thinks is a manipulative way to spend time with his new wife. She lied to her ex, telling him the kids don't want to go, even though she didn't tell them about the trip. \n\nSo, the key points here are the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have rights to visitation unless restricted by a court order. If there's no such order preventing the ex from having custody or visitation, then the author might be interfering with those rights. That could be a problem. But if there's a court order that limits the ex's time, then maybe it's justified.\n\nEthically, the author believes she's protecting her children from what she sees as the ex's manipulative behavior and the presence of the mistress. However, lying could be seen as deceitful. The ex isn't in a position to force the kids to go, so the author's decision might be based on her protection instincts. But is lying the right approach? Some might argue that transparency is better, even if it's painful, so the kids can make their own decisions as they grow older. Others might say the mother's emotional state and the ex's history justify the lie.\n\nThe ex's actions of using money to buy the kids' affection might be a factor. If the author believes the kids are being manipulated, she's trying to shield them. However, the line between protection and control can be thin. The children are 10 and 13, so they might have some say in their holidays, but the mother is the one making the decision here.\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author is wrong for lying. The author disagrees. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If the ex's visitation is legally allowed, then lying could be interfering with that. But if the ex's behavior is harmful, maybe it's justified. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might depend on legal aspects. If there's no court order, then yes, she's in the wrong. If there is, then not. But since the scenario doesn't mention legal restrictions, the default position would be that the ex has the right to visitation, so lying to prevent that could be unethical or illegal. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But some people might side with her due to the ex's past behavior. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong, so the answer would be A (Yes) if the lie interferes with legal rights, or B (No) if the context justifies it. Given the information, I think the answer is A.\n"
