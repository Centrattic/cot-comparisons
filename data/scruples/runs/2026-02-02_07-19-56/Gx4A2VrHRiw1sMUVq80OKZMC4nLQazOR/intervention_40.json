In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for lying to their ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The main issue here is the lie told to keep the kids away from the ex's new wife, who is also his mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex cheated, which is a major betrayal, and the kids only see their dad twice a year. The ex now has a new wife, which the author is clearly upset about. The ex wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, which the author believes is a manipulative move to bond with them through money. The author lied to the kids about their dad's plans and told the ex that the kids declined the offer.\n\nNow, the key points here are the children's well-being and the legal rights of the ex. In many jurisdictions, both parents have the right to have a relationship with their children unless there's a court order restricting visitation. The author's decision to lie might interfere with the ex's parental rights. Even if the ex's actions are questionable, withholding information from the kids about their father's plans could be problematic. The kids have a right to know about their father's intentions unless there's a valid reason to protect them from harm. However, the author's intent was to protect the kids from the new stepmother, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle is the author's emotional state. They mention the divorce is still raw, so their actions might be influenced by lingering hurt. But how does that affect the kids? If the ex is not a good father, but has visitation rights, the author's interference could be seen as overstepping. On the other hand, the ex's behavior\u2014using money to buy the kids' affection and taking them away to Japan with his new wife\u2014might be manipulative. The author's lie could be seen as a protective measure to prevent the kids from being used in this way.\n\nBut legally and ethically, lying to the children about their father's plans could prevent them from making their own choices. The kids are 10 and 13, so depending on their maturity, they might have a say in where they spend Christmas. The author didn't inform them of the offer, which could be seen as undermining the children's autonomy. Additionally, the ex wasn't given a truthful response, which might hinder future communication or co-parenting efforts.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that the author acted wrongly, which the user is considering. The author's justification is to prevent the ex from manipulating the children, but the means (lying) could create more problems. There's also the question of whether the ex's new wife being \"barely legal\" is relevant. If that's true, it's a serious issue, but the user didn't specify the exact age, so I can't assume that's a factor here.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions were to protect the kids from a potentially harmful situation, the act of lying might infringe on the ex's parental rights and the children's autonomy. The ethical balance here is tricky. On one hand, protecting children from a manipulative parent; on the other, respecting legal rights and the children's right to know. Given that the ex has visitation rights unless restricted by a court, the author's lie could be seen as interfering with those rights. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, but there are mitigating factors. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because the lie was intended to manipulate the outcome without considering the children's right to know.\n"
