In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for lying to their ex-husband about where their kids wanted to go for Christmas to prevent them from spending time with his mistress, who is now his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parents are divorced, and the ex cheated with a coworker who was a subordinate. The kids are 10 and 13. The ex wants to take them to Japan for Christmas, which he knows they like, possibly to bond with them post-divorce. The author lied about the kids not wanting to go, instead of telling them the truth about the trip being with the new wife. The friend says the author is wrong, but the author thinks they're stopping manipulation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent to protect the kids from the ex's new wife, the method used (lying), and the ethical considerations around parental decisions regarding children's time with the other parent.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have rights to custody and visitation unless there are safety concerns. The ex's intention might be to spend time with the kids, but the author is concerned about the new wife's influence. However, the author's lie prevents the kids from making their own choice unless they were mature enough. The age of the kids is 10 and 13; 13 might be old enough to have some input, but 10 is still young. The author's decision to withhold the truth could be seen as manipulating the situation to avoid the ex's new wife, but maybe also protecting the kids from a potentially uncomfortable situation.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author might be acting out of resentment and a desire to prevent the kids from being influenced by the ex's new wife. However, lying to the kid's father about their wishes could be considered dishonest and might undermine the kids' autonomy. The ex isn't being given the full context, and the author is using their judgment to override the kids' potential interest in a trip to Japan.\n\nThe friend's criticism suggests that the author shouldn't have lied, perhaps implying that the ex should have the chance to involve the kids, even if the author is uncomfortable with his new wife. The ex isn't a perfect parent, but if there's no legal barrier, the mother might be overstepping by not allowing the kids to decide or by not being transparent.\n\nAlso, the term \"barely legal\" might be a red herring or exaggerated. If the new wife is now legally his spouse, that's a separate issue. If the author's intention is to keep the kids away from the new wife, that might be a personal conflict, but unless there's a court order or abuse, it's a matter of personal ethics.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was deceptive and if there are clear justifications. Lying can be seen as wrong if it's not protecting the child from harm but from the parent's personal issues. The author might be projecting their own feelings onto the kids, assuming that the kids would be uncomfortable, but maybe the kids just want to go to Japan and don't care about the new wife.\n\nSo, the author's action is a lie to manipulate the ex's decision. Even if the motive is protecting the kids from the ex's manipulative tactics, the method is still deception. The ethical dilemma here is between the mother's right to protect her children's emotional well-being and the father's right to have a relationship with his children. If there are no legal reasons to block visitation, the mother's lie could be seen as interfering with the kids' relationship with their father, even if the father's behavior is questionable.\n\nThe answer would likely hinge on whether the author's actions are justified in the context of the kids' best interests. If the ex is a bad father but the trip is a positive experience for the kids, the mother might be the asshole for denying that. However, if the new wife is harmful or if the ex is using the trip to manipulate the kids, then maybe it's justified. But the story doesn't indicate any immediate harm beyond the mother's personal feelings. So, the lie is based on the mother's perception of manipulation rather than actual harm. In that case, the mother might be in the wrong for not allowing the kids to make their own choice and for not being truthful with the ex.\n"
