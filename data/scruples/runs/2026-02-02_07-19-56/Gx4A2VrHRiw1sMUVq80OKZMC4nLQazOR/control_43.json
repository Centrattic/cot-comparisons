In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is the asshole (AITA) for lying to their ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress during the marriage. The author's friend said they shouldn't have lied, but the author disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, after divorce, both parents typically have visitation rights. If the ex has court-ordered custody or visitation, the mother might not have the legal right to deny it. However, if it's not legally mandated, maybe there's more room to negotiate. But the key here is the mother lying about the kids' preferences to avoid them being with the ex and his new wife. \n\nEthically, the mother's intent is to protect her kids from what she sees as a manipulative situation. The ex cheated, leading to the divorce, and now the new wife is his former mistress. The ex is using Christmas as an opportunity to bond with the kids, possibly through financial means. The mother might feel that the kids are being used to replace their previous family dynamic with a new one that includes the mistress. \n\nHowever, lying to the kids about their father's intentions could backfire. If the kids find out later, it might damage their trust in the mother. Also, the ex might have a right to be with his children, and denying access without a legal basis could be problematic. The friend's argument is that the mother shouldn't have lied, which implies that even if she wanted to protect the kids, honesty is important. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's actions are driven by protecting the kids from a situation she perceives as harmful. She might believe that the ex is manipulating the kids and that the new wife is inappropriate. If the kids are old enough (10 and 13), their actual preferences should be considered, but the mother chose not to share the offer, which could be seen as undermining the kids' autonomy. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the ex's behavior. Cheating with a coworker who was in a position of subordination is ethically questionable. The mother's resentment is understandable, but her solution involved deception. The ex might have a legal right to visitation, but the manipulation aspect (using Japan trip as a way to get the kids) complicates it. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, the parent with primary custody can make decisions about visitation, but they still need to consider the child's best interests. If the other parent is trying to gain favor by lavish spending, it's a concern. However, lying to prevent that might be seen as overstepping, even if the mother's intent is good. \n\nThe children's well-being is central here. If the mother is shielding them from a potentially harmful relationship with their father's new wife, but at the cost of honesty, it's a tough call. The kids might have wanted to go to Japan but felt their mother's decision was made without their input. \n\nSo, the author's actions are morally ambiguous. Legally, if there's no court order, the mother might have some leeway, but ethically, lying to the kids and to the ex could be problematic. The friend's point is valid in that honesty is important, but the mother's protection motives are also understandable. The answer likely leans towards B, but I need to be careful about the nuances.\n"
