In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their ex about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas because they didn't want the kids to spend time with the ex's mistress, who is now his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex cheated, which is a big deal. The person is still hurt and it's a recent divorce. The ex is now trying to bond with the kids during his visitation, which is only twice a year. The ex is using money to buy the kids' affection, which the person is upset about. The ex's new wife is the mistress, and the person doesn't want the kids to spend time with her. \n\nThe author lied to their ex about the kids' preferences. The ex had asked the kids' opinion because the kids usually spend Christmas with grandparents. The author said the kids declined Japan, but the truth is they were never actually asked. The author's friend says it's wrong, but they disagree.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, lying is generally dishonest. The ex has a right to know what the kids want, especially if it's part of their custody agreement. By lying, the author is preventing the ex from having that experience with the kids, which might be his right as a parent. Also, the kids might miss out on an opportunity to do something they wanted, like visiting Japan and experiencing Japanese culture they love.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's actions are questionable. He cheated, the author is still healing, and the ex is now with his mistress. The author's motivation is to protect the kids from being manipulated or from seeing the mistress. The ex's intent might be more about showing off money and bonding, which the author sees as manipulative. The author might feel that the ex isn't a good father, so they're acting in the kids' best interest by keeping them away from a potentially toxic situation.\n\nBut legally, unless there's a court order restricting the ex's contact with the kids, the author can't unilaterally decide where the kids go. The ex has visitation rights, and the author's lie could interfere with that. The author's actions might be seen as undermining the ex's parenting rights. Also, the kids might be confused later if they find out the truth, which could affect their relationship with both parents.\n\nHowever, the emotional aspect is significant. The author is protecting the kids from what they perceive as a harmful situation. If the ex's new wife is involved, maybe the kids are already aware of the divorce and the cheating, so the author is trying to shield them from further discomfort. But the lie could backfire if the kids end up resenting both parents for different reasons.\n\nI think the key points are the legality of the ex's visitation rights and the author's intent. If the author is acting out of protection, maybe it's understandable, but the method is dishonest. The ex has a right to know the kids' wishes, so lying might be a breach of that. However, the ex's behavior (cheating, using money to buy affection) complicates things. It's a tough call, but lying might not be the best approach. Maybe the author should have tried to communicate the concerns honestly instead of lying.\n"
