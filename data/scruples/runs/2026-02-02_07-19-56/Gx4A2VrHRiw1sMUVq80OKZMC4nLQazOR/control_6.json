In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The situation involves a divorce where the ex cheated with a coworker, who later became his wife. The ex wants the kids to go to Japan for Christmas, but the author thinks it's a ploy to bond with the kids and his new wife, so she lied and said the kids don't want to go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The ex has custody arrangements, but the author is the one making decisions about the kids' preferences. Since the kids are 10 and 13, their wishes might be considered in custody decisions, but the parent's role is to act in their best interest. However, lying to the other parent about the kids' desires could be problematic. It might interfere with the ex's right to spend time with the children unless there are valid concerns about the children's well-being.\n\nThe ex's actions (cheating, introducing a new spouse) might raise valid concerns about the kids' emotional well-being. The author's decision was to protect the kids from what she perceives as manipulation. On the other hand, keeping the ex in the dark and lying could damage any future co-parenting efforts. If the author is withholding information to prevent the kids from having a positive experience with their father, even if he's not perfect, that's a gray area.\n\nEthically, honesty in co-parenting is generally advised. Lying could lead to mistrust and legal issues if the ex decides to challenge the decision. However, the author's intent was to protect the kids from a situation she believes is harmful. The ex's behavior might be seen as selfish, using the children to feel better about his new relationship. But the author's lie might prevent the kids from experiencing a culturally enriching trip they wanted. \n\nI need to check if there are any legal guidelines. In many places, both parents have the right to spend time with their children unless there's a court order restricting it. If the author is lying to prevent that, she might be acting against the court's intended custody arrangements. However, if the ex is violating custody agreements or there are valid safety concerns, the situation changes. The author mentions the ex is \"objectively not a good father,\" but without specific evidence of harm, it's hard to say if her actions are justified legally.\n\nEmotionally, the author is still dealing with the trauma of the divorce and betrayal. Her actions might stem from protectiveness, but lying could backfire if the kids discover the truth later. It's possible the ex could seek legal action or the situation could escalate. On the other hand, the ex might be using the kids to fill a void from the divorce, and the author's intervention prevents that. \n\nIn conclusion, the decision hinges on whether protecting the kids from what the author sees as manipulation justifies the lie. If there's no legal wrongdoing and the ex isn't violating custody terms, the lie could be seen as unethical. However, if the ex's actions are harmful and the author has a valid reason to protect the kids, it's a more complex situation. Since the author isn't providing specific evidence of harm beyond her perception, the lie might be considered wrong because it undermines honest co-parenting.\n"
