In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about where the kids wanted to spend Christmas. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe ex-husband cheated with a coworker, then they got divorced. Now he's living with the mistress, who's now his wife, and he only sees their kids twice a year. He's trying to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, but the author lies to the kids, saying they can't go because he's with his new wife. The author's friend says she's wrong, but she disagrees.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether lying to the children is appropriate. The author's motivation is to protect the kids from spending time with their father's new wife, who was his mistress. The ex is using money to try to buy the kids' affection, and the author thinks this is a manipulation tactic. But is lying justified?\n\nIn co-parenting situations, honesty is usually important. If the author is withholding the truth from the kids, that could have consequences. The kids might feel they're being kept in the dark, or find out the truth later, which might damage trust. Also, the father has his rights, even if he's not a good parent. Blocking his attempts to spend time with the kids, even if it's with his new wife, might interfere with his parenting time unless there's a court order preventing that.\n\nThe author's actions prevent the kids from choosing to go to Japan, which they might have wanted. The father is providing a different holiday experience, which the kids might enjoy. The author is essentially making a decision for the kids based on her feelings towards the ex and his new wife. But is that fair to the kids? They might have their own opinions about spending time with their dad and stepmom.\n\nAlso, the father isn't in the wrong here necessarily. Cheating is bad, but now he's married to the mistress. The author's ex has a right to be involved with his children, even if the author disagrees with his choices. The author's lie could be seen as interfering with the father's parenting time, which might not be her right.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation is to protect the kids from what she sees as manipulation. She feels hurt and betrayed, and maybe she doesn't want the kids to be exposed to a situation that could be emotionally difficult. But in the long run, lying to the kids about their father's intentions could backfire. The kids might feel they can't trust their mom's decisions or might learn the truth in a hurtful way.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are understandable, the act of lying to the children and manipulating their response is ethically questionable. It's possible that a more honest approach, perhaps discussing the situation with the kids and co-parenting more openly, would be better, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because she's acting on her personal feelings rather than the best interests of the kids, and possibly violating co-parenting principles.\n"
