In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his mistress, now his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The key points are that the author and her ex are divorced, and their children are 10 and 13. The ex cheated with a coworker who is now his wife. The ex wants the kids to spend Christmas in Japan, which the author thinks is a ploy to bond with them after the affair. The author lied to her ex, telling him the kids didn't want to go, to keep them with her parents instead.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The possible angles here include legal custody arrangements, the ethics of lying to protect children from a parent they don't see often, and the emotional impact on the children.\n\nLegally, if there's a co-parenting agreement, the author might need to follow specific guidelines. If the ex has visitation rights, the author could be interfering with that. However, the situation doesn't mention legal details, so I can't be sure. But the user might assume that the author is within her rights if there's no legal requirement to allow the visit. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author's action is motivated by protecting the kids from her ex's new wife, whom she views negatively. But lying could prevent the kids from spending time with their father, which is their right. However, the ex is described as a manipulative figure, using expensive gifts to gain favor. The author might believe she's shielding the kids from emotional harm or manipulation. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that the author shouldn't have lied, suggesting that honesty is always best in co-parenting. But if the ex's intention is indeed manipulative, the author's lie could be seen as a protective measure. \n\nAnother angle is the children's wishes. The kids are 10 and 13, so they have some level of agency. However, the author might have made the decision without their input, which could affect their relationship with the author later on. \n\nThe ex's behavior is questionable, but the author's deception could have long-term consequences. If the kids find out they were lied to, they might feel betrayed. However, if the ex is truly being manipulative, the author's action might be justified as a form of protection. \n\nUltimately, the answer hinges on the balance between protecting the children from a harmful situation and upholding the rights of the other parent. Since the ex is described as a problematic figure using money to buy affection, the author's lie might be seen as a necessary evil. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
