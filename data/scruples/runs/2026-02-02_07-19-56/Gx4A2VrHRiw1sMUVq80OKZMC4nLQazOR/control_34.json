In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a parent who is divorced from their ex-husband. The ex cheated with a coworker, who is now his wife. The kids are 10 and 13, and the ex wants them to spend Christmas in Japan with him and his new wife, but the author lied to the kids about it, saying the ex isn't around because he's with his mistress. The author's friend says they shouldn't have lied, but the author thinks they stopped a manipulative plan.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The ex is trying to reconnect with the kids after a divorce that was hurtful. The author might be protecting the kids from a potentially harmful situation, given the ex's history. But lying to the kids about their father's whereabouts? That could be problematic. The kids have a right to know both parents, unless there's a valid reason to restrict contact. However, the ex's new wife was once his mistress, which might be a point of contention. \n\nBut legally, in many places, a parent can't unilaterally decide where the kids spend holidays unless there's a court order restricting the other parent's access. If the ex has custody rights, the author might not have the legal authority to block him, unless there are valid safety concerns. The author is lying to prevent the kids from going, which could interfere with the ex's parenting time. \n\nHowever, the ex is using the trip as a way to buy their affection with money, which could be seen as manipulative. The author's motivation is to protect the kids from a potentially unhealthy dynamic, but the method of lying might not be the best approach. The kids might feel lied to, which could affect their trust in the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex's actions in cheating and then involving the mistress (now wife) might have caused lasting damage. The author's trauma from the divorce is real, and they might be acting from a place of hurt. But is lying the right way to handle that? It's a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if the ex's intentions are genuinely harmful, but they might be overstepping if the ex has the right to custody time. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to protect their children from a potentially bad situation, even if the method is questionable. However, there's also a case that they should address this through proper channels instead of lying. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, given the context of the ex's manipulative behavior.\n"
