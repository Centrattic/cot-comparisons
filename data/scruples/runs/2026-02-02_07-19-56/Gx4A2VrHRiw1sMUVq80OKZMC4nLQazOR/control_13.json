In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about her kids' Christmas plans. The backstory is that the ex cheated, now he's with his mistress (now his wife), and he wanted to take the kids to Japan without the author. She lied and told him the kids didn't want to go, so they could stay with her parents instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Lying is generally seen as wrong, but there might be exceptions for protecting children from a harmful or manipulative parent. The ex is described as not a good father, using money to buy the kids' affection. The author might feel that she's protecting the kids from a potentially negative environment, given the ex's history of cheating and the new wife being \"barely legal\" (though the ex is presumably an adult, so maybe that's a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe she meant the wife was inconsiderate or inappropriate).\n\nThe key points are: the ex's intent to use the trip as a ploy to bond with the kids, the author's emotional state due to the divorce, and the kids' well-being. The author's friend says she's wrong for lying, but the author feels justified. \n\nLegally, in co-parenting situations, both parents usually have rights. However, if one parent is unfit, the court might intervene. The author might not have the legal right to deny access, but she's not exactly denying access; she's just influencing the kids' decision by lying. The kids are 10 and 13, so they might be old enough to make some choices, but the parent is supposed to guide them. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect her children from a manipulative parent. However, lying to her ex about the kids' wishes could be seen as manipulative as well. The ex might have had a legitimate right to ask the kids, and by lying, the author is preventing that. But given the ex's behavior, maybe the author's actions are a form of self-defense and protection for the kids. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the ex not being a good father. If he's using money to buy the kids' affection, the author might believe that the kids are being manipulated, and keeping them away is in their best interest. However, the ex is still a parent, and the kids have a right to have a relationship with both parents unless there's a court order restricting that. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's a gray area. The author's intentions are to protect her children from a harmful situation, but the method involves deceit. Whether that makes her the \"asshole\" depends on the balance between the harm of the ex's actions versus the harm of lying. If the ex was genuinely trying to spend time with the kids in a positive way, the author's lie could be harmful. But if the ex's intentions are manipulative and harmful, the lie could be justified. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that lying is wrong, but the author might have valid reasons. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions are in the kids' best interest. Since the ex's behavior is questionable and the trip seems like a ploy, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, legally, she might have overstepped, but the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about morality. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's acting in what she believes is the best interest of her children, protecting them from a manipulative parent. While lying is not ideal, the context of the ex's behavior justifies her actions.\n"
