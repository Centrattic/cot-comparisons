In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by lying to her ex-husband about her kids' Christmas plans. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated, and now he's married to his mistress. The kids are with the mom most of the time, only seeing the dad twice a year. The dad wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, which he knows they love, but the mom thinks it's a manipulative move to get them to bond with his new wife. The mom lies to the kids and tells her ex they refused the trip so they can stay with her parents instead.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions and the consequences. The mom's main reason is to protect the kids from what she perceives as her ex's manipulation. She feels that the ex is using the kids to replace the wife he cheated with. However, the ex is a legal parent, and the kids have a right to see him, unless there's a court order preventing that. Lying to them about the trip could be seen as undermining the ex's parental rights. \n\nBut on the other hand, the ex's behavior is questionable. Cheating and then quickly marrying the mistress while trying to spend quality time with the kids might be part of a pattern that's not in the kids' best interest. The mom's actions are protective, but lying isn't the healthiest approach. Maybe there's a better way, like discussing it with the kids or involving a mediator. Still, the ex has a right to be in the kids' lives unless proven otherwise in court. \n\nThe mom's friend says she was wrong, but the user is conflicted. The ethical dilemma is between protecting the kids from a manipulative parent versus respecting the other parent's rights. The law usually favors both parents having a relationship with their children unless there's danger. Since there's no mention of legal issues, the mom's lie might be seen as wrong because it could be blocking a legitimate parental right. However, the ex's actions (cheating, using money to influence) might justify the mom's protective stance. \n\nIn summary, while the mom's intentions are to protect, the act of lying to prevent the visit could be legally and ethically questionable. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she's interfering with the ex's parental rights without legal justification. But if the ex's behavior is deemed harmful, the answer could be B. But given the general legal stance, the lie might be the problem.\n"
