In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a parent who divorced their ex-husband, who cheated with a coworker, and now they've married that person. The ex is trying to get the kids to spend Christmas with them in Japan, but the author lied to the kids about it to prevent that. The ex isn't a good father, but he has money and is using it to try to buy the kids' affection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions for their children, especially regarding visitation. But after a divorce, there might be custody agreements. If the ex has visitation rights, the author might need to follow those. However, if there's no legal requirement for the kids to spend time with the ex, the author might have more freedom. The author mentions the kids spend Christmas with grandparents, which is a tradition. So maybe the ex is trying to change that without legal grounds.\n\nEthically, the author is protecting their kids from a parent who's not acting in their best interest, according to the author. The ex is using money to manipulate the kids, which is concerning. The author's lie is to prevent the kids from being exposed to a situation that might be harmful or confusing. But lying to children about their parent's intentions could have its own issues. The kids might feel betrayed if they find out they were lied to, especially if they wanted to go to Japan.\n\nHowever, the ex's actions are questionable. Cheating, then marrying the mistress, and trying to use financial resources to gain favor with the kids could be seen as manipulative. The author is trying to shield the kids from that, which is a protective measure. But the method of lying might be problematic. Instead of lying, maybe the author could have explained the situation to the kids and made a joint decision, or sought legal advice if necessary.\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author shouldn't have lied, which suggests there's a conflict in moral judgment. The author feels justified because they see the ex's actions as manipulative. Others might argue that the ex has a right to spend time with the kids, and the author is undermining that. But if the ex's behavior is harmful, maybe it's in the kids' best interest to limit contact.\n\nSo considering all this, the author's actions are driven by protecting the kids from a potentially harmful situation. The ex's behavior is questionable, and the author is taking steps to prevent the kids from being influenced negatively. While lying isn't ideal, the intent is protective. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
