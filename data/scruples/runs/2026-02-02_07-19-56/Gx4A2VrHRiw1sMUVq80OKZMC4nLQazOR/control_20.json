In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who lied to their ex-husband about their kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was previously his mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The ex-husband cheated with a coworker who was even under his authority, which adds a power dynamic. The author is still emotionally affected by the divorce and believes the ex is using money to buy the kids' affection. The ex wants the kids to go to Japan with him and his new wife, but the author thinks it's a manipulative ploy to bond them, ignoring the kids' usual tradition with their grandparents.\n\nThe author lied, telling the ex that the kids didn't want to go, even though they weren't consulted. The friend later criticized this, but the author defends it as protecting the kids from the ex's manipulation. \n\nNow, considering legal and ethical angles. In many places, after a divorce, both parents have rights to spend time with their children unless there's a court order restricting it. The author's lie could interfere with the ex's parenting time. However, if there are valid concerns about the ex's behavior\u2014like the affair and questionable motives\u2014it might be a protective measure. But the author didn't mention any legal restrictions or custody issues that would justify the lie. \n\nEthically, lying to prevent the kids from being with the other parent is tricky. Parents have a duty to act in their children's best interests. If the author believes the ex is genuinely manipulative and harmful, maybe the lie is protective. However, the author's judgment could be clouded by personal feelings from the divorce. Also, the kids' preferences matter; they might want to spend time with their dad, even if it's part of his strategy. \n\nThe author's friend argues against the lie, which is a red flag. Trusting the legal system or a custody arrangement is usually better than unilateral decisions. The author might be overstepping by making choices without consulting the kids or considering their rights. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the ex's behavior. Cheating on the author with someone under his employ is serious, and the new wife was a mistress. The author might see this as a way to protect the kids from a toxic influence. Still, unless there's a court order preventing contact, it's a gray area. The lie could prevent the kids from having a relationship with their father, which is also a concern. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be protective, the act of lying undermines the legal and ethical principles of co-parenting. The ex has a right to see his children unless proven otherwise in court. The author's personal feelings shouldn't override the kids' right to see both parents unless there's a valid legal reason. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they interfered with the ex's parenting time without legal justification, even if their intentions were protective.\n"
