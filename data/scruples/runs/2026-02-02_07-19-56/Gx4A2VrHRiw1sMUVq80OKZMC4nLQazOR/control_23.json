In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about where the kids wanted to go for Christmas to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation fully. The ex-husband cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author is still emotionally raw from the divorce. The ex is now married to the mistress and only sees the kids twice a year. He wants the kids to spend Christmas with him in Japan, but the author doesn't want them to go, thinking it's a manipulative move to bond them with the new wife. She lies about the kids' wishes to say no.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's motivation is to protect the kids from what she sees as a manipulative situation. The ex is using money to buy the kids' affection. The author feels hurt and betrayed, and this action is a way to shield the kids from what she perceives as a negative influence. However, lying to the kids and the ex could have consequences. The ex might feel that the author isn't being honest, and the kids might be caught in the middle of a parental conflict.\n\nBut then, in custody or co-parenting situations, both parents have rights. The author's decision to lie could be seen as undermining the ex's parenting time, especially if the ex is legally allowed to have those visitations. Also, the kids might have a right to know and decide for themselves if they want to go. By not telling them the truth, the author is taking away their agency in the matter.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's behavior is questionable. Cheating and then entering into a relationship with the mistress is part of a pattern that the author finds manipulative. The author's emotional state is still affected by the divorce, and she's protecting the kids from a situation she sees as harmful. The ex's use of money could be a red flag, and the author might be acting in the kids' best interest by preventing them from being exposed to that dynamic.\n\nBut then again, lying might not be the right approach. Even if the ex's intentions are bad, the author should perhaps work through legal channels or communicate openly rather than deceive. This could lead to more conflict down the line. The ex might not have a legal right to visitation, but if it's part of the divorce agreement, interfering could have consequences.\n\nThe author's friend says she shouldn't have lied, which adds another perspective. The author might be projecting her hurt on to the kids, thinking they're being manipulated, but maybe the kids actually want to go. By not asking them, she's assuming their desires without their input.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the ex has a legal right to see the kids, then interfering could be problematic. However, if the ex is being manipulative and harmful, the author might be justified in protecting the kids. But lying isn't the solution. The right approach would be to address the underlying issues through proper channels rather than deception.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The author's intentions are protective, but the method of lying is questionable. Co-parenting requires honesty, even if the other parent is flawed. So, while her motives are understandable, the action of lying is ethically problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
