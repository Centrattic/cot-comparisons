In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas to avoid them spending time with his new wife, who is his mistress. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her ex are divorced, and he cheated on her with a coworker who's now his wife. The kids are 10 and 13, and they've spent Christmases with the author's parents. The ex is using his money to try to buy the kids' affection by offering a trip to Japan. The author lied to her ex, telling him that the kids declined the trip, when in reality she didn't let them know about the offer.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motives and the potential harm of the lie. The author felt that the ex's offer was manipulative, using the kids' interests in Japanese culture to get them to spend time with him and his wife. She wanted to protect the kids from possibly being influenced against her or forming a bond with someone she views negatively.\n\nNow, is lying wrong? Well, lying can be problematic, especially when it involves children. However, the context here is a parent (the author) making a decision to protect her children from what she perceives as emotional manipulation. The ex's actions (cheating, moving on quickly, using money to influence the kids) might be seen as inappropriate or harmful.\n\nThe question is whether the author's lie is justified. If the ex is trying to manipulate the kids, and the author is trying to shield them from that, her actions could be seen as protective. However, lying to the other parent about the kids' wishes might interfere with their right to make their own decisions, especially as the kids are older and might have their own preferences.\n\nBut the author didn't even consult the kids, which could be an issue. If the kids wanted to go, her lie would prevent them from experiencing the trip. On the other hand, if the trip is part of the ex's strategy to undermine the author's role as a parent, then her lie could be seen as protecting the children's best interests.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In many places, both parents have the right to have their children spend time with them, unless there are concerns about safety or well-being. If the author is blocking access, that could be legally problematic. However, she's not blocking access; she's just not allowing the kids to choose this particular trip. It's a gray area.\n\nThe friend's criticism is that she shouldn't have lied. The author argues she was protecting the kids. So, the moral question is whether the ends justify the means. If the author truly believes the ex is manipulating, then her actions might be seen as justified. However, if there's no evidence of harm, then the lie could be unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, lying is generally frowned upon, but intentions matter. If the author's intention is to protect her children from a harmful situation, her actions might be more understandable. However, if the ex's actions aren't inherently harmful, then the lie could be seen as overstepping.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author acted in good faith to protect the kids from potential emotional harm versus infringing on their autonomy and the ex's rights. Given that the ex's behavior includes cheating and using money in a manipulative way, the author's actions might be seen as justified. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily the asshole.\n"
