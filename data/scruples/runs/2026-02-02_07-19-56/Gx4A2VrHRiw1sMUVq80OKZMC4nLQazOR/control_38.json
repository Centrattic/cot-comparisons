In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about lying to her ex-husband about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas, because she didn't want them spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The ex cheated, the author found out in a humiliating way, and the ex is now married to the mistress, and they only see the kids twice a year. The ex wants the kids to go to Japan for Christmas, which the author thinks is a manipulative attempt to bond with them. She lies to her ex, telling him the kids don't want to go, and instead they'll stay with grandparents as usual.\n\nNow, the question is whether lying was wrong. The author's friend says she shouldn't have lied, but the author disagrees. \n\nLet me break it down. The ex is in a new relationship with the mistress, and the author is worried about the kids being in that environment. The ex has money and is using it to try to gain the kids' favor. The author's intention is to protect the kids from what she sees as a manipulative situation. \n\nBut is lying okay in this context? Well, lying is generally considered unethical, but there are exceptions. If the lie is to protect someone from harm or in a bad situation. The author believes that going to Japan with the ex and his new wife is harmful or manipulative. However, the ex is the legal parent, so the kids' other parent has the right to have them visit. \n\nThe author's actions could interfere with the ex's parenting rights. Even if the author thinks the ex is a bad father, unless there's a legal agreement or court order preventing visits, the ex has the right to spend time with the kids. The author's lie might be interfering with that. \n\nAlso, the kids might have their own desires. The author didn't ask the kids, which is a problem. If the kids wanted to go, she's denying them that choice. But she did say the kids have always gone to grandparents, so maybe they're used to that. Still, the kids could have a say in their own holiday plans. \n\nThe ex's actions\u2014taking the kids to Japan\u2014might be seen as a way to bond, but the author has valid reasons to be distrustful. However, the lie could prevent the kids from having a relationship with their father. If the ex is a bad parent, maybe the author is protecting them, but it's a grey area. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author's intent is to protect the kids from a manipulative situation. But legally, unless there's a restriction, the ex's parenting time can't be unilaterally blocked. The author's lie could be seen as undermining the other parent's rights. \n\nSo, the key points are: Is the lie justified in protecting the kids from a harmful situation, or is it an overstep that violates the ex's rights as a parent? The author's friend thinks she's wrong, and the author disagrees. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to decide for the kids and the ex's rights. Since the ex is the legal parent, the author might be in the wrong by interfering with custody arrangements. However, if the ex is abusive or dangerous, the author might have a case. The scenario doesn't mention any abuse, just that he's a bad father and manipulative. \n\nSo in the absence of legal prohibitions against the ex's visitation, the author's lie might be considered unethical because it prevents the kids from spending time with their father. The author's motivation is understandable, but the action itself is a lie that affects the ex's parental rights. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
