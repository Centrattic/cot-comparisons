In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about where the kids wanted to spend Christmas. The situation is that the ex wants to take the kids to Japan with his new wife, who was his mistress. The author didn't want the kids to spend time with her ex and his wife, so she lied and told the ex the kids didn't want to go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex cheated, which is a big betrayal. Now they're divorced, but the ex is trying to maintain a relationship with the kids, possibly using money and gifts to win them over. The author is concerned about the kids being with their father and his new wife, who was his mistress. She felt it was manipulative, so she lied to prevent it.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, both parents usually have rights to their children unless there's a court order restricting contact. The author might not have the legal authority to block the ex's visitation unless there's a specific reason, like harm to the kids. But the user is asking about whether the author was in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally.\n\nEmotionally, the author is still hurt from the divorce and the cheating. She's trying to protect the kids from what she perceives as manipulation. However, lying to the ex about the kids' wishes could be seen as dishonesty. The kids might end up confused if they find out they were lied to. Also, the ex might feel that his parenting rights are being undermined.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's actions of taking the kids to Japan with his new wife, who was his mistress, could be seen as problematic. The author might believe she's acting in the kids' best interest by keeping them away from a potentially harmful situation. The friend who said she shouldn't have done it might be emphasizing honesty, but the author's intent was to protect the kids.\n\nThere's a conflict between honesty and protecting the children. The author's lie could be justified as protecting the kids from a manipulative situation, but it's still a lie. However, the ex's behavior in taking the kids with his mistress might not be in the kids' best interest either.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The author's intent was to shield the kids from what she saw as a harmful environment. The ex's actions might be seen as using the kids to gain favor. If the author believed that the visit would be harmful, her lie could be seen as a protective measure. However, the ethical issue is whether lying is acceptable in this context. \n\nIn some cases, protecting children from harmful situations is a priority, even if it involves deception. On the flip side, honesty is important for trust. But given the context of the ex's past behavior and the current situation, the author's actions might be considered morally justified despite the lie. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
