In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about her kids' Christmas plans. The situation involves a divorce where the ex cheated, is now with his mistress, and wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and ex are divorced, and the ex has significant money. The ex's new wife was his mistress during the marriage. The author feels the ex is using money to manipulate the kids. The key issue is whether lying to the kids about their preferences to prevent them from going with the ex is justified.\n\nThe author didn't tell the kids about the offer and instead fabricated their response to say they'd rather stay. The ex was informed the kids declined. The question is whether this lie is acceptable given the circumstances.\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. Protecting children from a potentially harmful or manipulative situation could be seen as a parent's duty. However, lying to the other parent might be problematic, especially if it's about the children's preferences. But the ex's actions (cheating, using money to gain favor) might justify the author's decision. The author might believe she's shielding the kids from emotional harm or manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the ex had a right to know the kids' actual wishes, lying could be seen as undermining their autonomy. However, the author might argue that the ex's true intentions (manipulation via luxury) make the lie a necessary evil.\n\nLegally, parental rights and custody arrangements matter. If the ex has visitation rights, the author might be overstepping by preventing him from exercising them. But if the court allows such decisions, her actions might be justified.\n\nEmotionally, the author is still dealing with the betrayal and the ex's new relationship. Her actions could be a way to cope, but could they harm the kids in the long run? If the kids wanted to go, being denied might affect their relationship with both parents.\n\nThe friend's criticism suggests that the author should have communicated truthfully. However, the author might feel that the ex's intentions were malicious, making the lie a protective measure.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a form of deception, but the context\u2014protecting children from a manipulative ex\u2014might be seen as a mitigating factor. The answer likely depends on whether the lie was necessary to prevent harm, which is subjective. However, in terms of right vs. wrong, there's a strong argument that the author is not in the wrong given the circumstances.\n"
