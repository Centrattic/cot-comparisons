In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a divorce where the ex-husband cheated with a coworker, who's now his wife. The ex is trying to spend Christmas with the kids in Japan, possibly to bond with them, and the author lied to the kids about his plans, saying he's away with a \"sidepiece\" to keep them from going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. After a divorce, custody arrangements usually dictate where and with whom the children spend their holidays. If the ex has legal visitation rights or a court order allowing him to take the kids, then the author might be interfering with that. But the post doesn't mention any legal custody issues, so maybe it's about shared custody or the father's new wife trying to influence the kids.\n\nEthically, the author is lying to the kids about their father's whereabouts. The ex is using the kids' interests (Japanese stuff) to manipulate them into wanting to go. The author's intent was to prevent the kids from being with someone they don't like (the mistress now wife) and a father who they don't get along with well. However, lying to children, even with good intentions, can have consequences. It might teach them that lying is okay, or it could harm their relationship with the author if they find out the truth.\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author shouldn't have lied, but the author disagrees. The key here is whether the lie was justified. The ex is described as manipulative, using money to buy the kids' love, which suggests he's using unethical tactics. The author might be protecting the kids from what they perceive as a harmful situation, but is lying the right approach?\n\nAlso, the ex was not invited, and the author is prioritizing the kids' traditional holiday with grandparents. The ex's actions of living with the mistress and only seeing the kids twice a year could be seen as neglectful. The author might be acting in the kids' best interest by maintaining their existing traditions and preventing the ex from using holidays to manipulate them.\n\nBut legally and ethically, the parents should have a say in such decisions, especially if the ex has a right to visitation. The author isn't consulting the ex on the kids' preferences, which could be a problem. However, the ex's manipulation might be a valid reason to question his parenting decisions. The author's lie could be a form of protection, but it's a gray area because it's still a lie.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's actions are harmful to the kids' relationship with their father, even if he's a bad father. But the ex's actions (cheating, using money to influence) are also problematic. The author is trying to shield the kids from a potentially hurtful situation, but lying might not be the best method. The friend's criticism is about the lie, but the author thinks it was necessary. \n\nIn many cases, both parents are supposed to have a role in the children's lives unless there's a court order preventing that. The author might be justifying the lie as protection, but it's still withholding information and manipulating the kids' decisions. Even if the ex is manipulative, the author's lie could be seen as equally manipulative. However, the ex's actions are more clearly unethical and harmful. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author is protecting the kids from a manipulative and potentially harmful parent. But there's a risk in lying to them. However, the ex's behavior is the root issue, so the author's actions could be seen as necessary. Alternatively, the author should have been honest and let the kids decide, even if the ex is using emotional manipulation. But the author might believe the kids are too young to understand the situation. \n\nI think in this context, the author's intention to protect the kids from a manipulative situation, even if it involves a lie, is more about their well-being. The ex's actions are the main problem here. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
