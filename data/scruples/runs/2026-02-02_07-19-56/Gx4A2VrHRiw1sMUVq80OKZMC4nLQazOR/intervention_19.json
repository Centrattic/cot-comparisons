In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about her kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. The ex cheated, got a divorce, and now the kids only see him twice a year. The mother didn't want them to spend time with his new wife, so she lied and told the ex the kids said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014cheating, moving on quickly, and trying to buy the kids' love with expensive trips. The mother feels hurt and betrayed. She's protecting the kids from what she sees as a manipulative situation. But lying to the ex about the kids' wishes is a key point here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mother did the right thing. On one hand, she's protecting her children from a potentially harmful situation with a parent who isn't a good father and from the stepmother who was the ex's mistress. On the other hand, she's lying to the ex, which could be seen as deceitful. But the ex's actions were deceptive too, so maybe her actions are a form of self-defense?\n\nThe friend said she shouldn't have lied, but the mother disagrees. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to think about the ethics here. Lying is generally frowned upon, but sometimes justified in cases of protecting others, especially children. The mother's intention was to shield the kids from their father's manipulative behavior. However, the father has a legal right to see his children, unless there's a court order preventing it. If the mother is interfering with custody arrangements, that could be problematic legally, but the story doesn't mention any legal issues. \n\nThe mother might be acting in the kids' best interest based on her perspective. But is lying acceptable here? If the kids wanted to go, the mother's decision not to let them could be overstepping, but the story says the mother didn't even tell the kids about the offer, which adds another layer of complexity. By not telling them, she's also controlling their choices, which might not be right for teenagers and a 10-year-old. \n\nHowever, the father's actions are questionable. He's using a fake invitation to Japan as a way to spend time with the kids and his new wife. The mother's lie prevents that. So, is the mother justified in lying to protect her kids from what she sees as a bad influence? Or is she being selfish, not letting the kids decide for themselves?\n\nThe father's behavior is manipulative, so the mother's lie could be a necessary evil. But legally, the father has visitation rights unless restricted. If the mother is denying him that through deception, it's a legal issue too. But the story doesn't mention any legal consequences, so maybe it's not relevant here.\n\nIn terms of morality, the mother is acting out of a place of hurt and protection. The ex's actions were hurtful, so the mother's response might be seen as justified. However, lying is still a lie, even if the intent is good. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, I'm leaning towards the mother not being in the wrong. She's protecting her children from a manipulative and harmful situation. The lie is to prevent the ex from getting what he wants, which is the kids' time and affection. Therefore, the answer might be B (no).\n"
