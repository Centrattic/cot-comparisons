In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent lying to an ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with the ex and his new wife, who was the ex's mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, after a divorce, both parents have rights to their children's time unless there are court restrictions. The author's ex is offering a Christmas trip, which the kids are excited about because of their interest in Japanese culture. The author, however, lies about the kids' preferences to keep them away, possibly due to ongoing resentment from the cheating and the new marriage.\n\nThe author's motivation is based on protecting the kids from what they perceive as manipulation by the ex. But is lying to the kids appropriate? Even if the ex is not a good father, the kids have a right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a court order preventing it. The author's action could be seen as interfering with the ex's parenting time, especially if there's no legal restriction. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex's behavior (cheating, using money to gain favor) might make the author's decision seem more understandable. However, lying to the kids about their father's plans and the ex's intentions could harm the children's trust in the author. Also, the ex was not invited, but the author's response might escalate conflict rather than resolve it.\n\nThe key factors are the legal rights of both parents, the children's best interests, and the method used to deny the ex's request. If there are no legal barriers, withholding the truth might be considered unethical or even harmful. The author's friend thinks they're in the wrong, which adds another perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, using deception to prevent the ex from having time with the kids might be ethically questionable, especially if it affects the children's well-being and trust. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
