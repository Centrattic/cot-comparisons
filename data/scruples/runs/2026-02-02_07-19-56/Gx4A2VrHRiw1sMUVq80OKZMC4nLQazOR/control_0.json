In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their ex-husband about their kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress. The situation is quite complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and ex are divorced, and the ex cheated with a coworker who's now his wife. The kids are 10 and 13, and the ex is trying to bond with them through expensive trips. The author felt the trip to Japan was a manipulation tactic to get the kids to spend time with him and his new wife, so they lied to the kids, saying their dad wasn't available because he was with his mistress. The friend said the author shouldn't have done it, but they disagree.\n\nNow, the key points here are about lying versus protecting the kids. The author's intention was to shield the children from what they see as a manipulative situation. However, lying to the kids might be harmful in the long run. On the other hand, the ex's actions could be seen as trying to reconnect with the kids, which is a parent's right, even if the approach seems underhanded.\n\nLegally, both parents usually have visitation rights. The author might be interfering with that. But emotionally, if the ex was abusive or manipulative, the author might have a point. But the author is making a judgment about the ex's motivations and the new wife's intentions, which could be biased. The kids might want to spend time with their dad regardless of the ex's intentions. Also, lying could damage trust with the kids once they find out.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the lie was justified. If the ex's actions were genuinely harmful, maybe. But if it's just about preventing time with his new spouse, the author's interference might be overreach. Since the author's friend said they shouldn't have lied, it's a gray area. The author's emotional response is valid, but the method (lying) is questionable. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong for lying, even if their intentions were protective.\n"
