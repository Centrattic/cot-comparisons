In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated with a coworker who worked under him and was aware of their marriage. The author found out a year later and then was humiliated at a work event. They divorced three years ago, but it's still raw. The ex is now with the mistress, and the author feels he's not a good father but uses money to try to buy the kids' affection.\n\nThe ex wants the kids to come to Japan for Christmas, which the kids have always spent with their grandparents. The author lies to the ex, saying the kids don't want to go because he's with his new wife, and instead they'll stay with their grandparents. The author's friend says she's wrong, but the author thinks she stopped a manipulation attempt.\n\nSo, the main question is whether lying was the right or wrong decision. The author's reasoning is that the ex is trying to manipulate the kids by taking them to Japan, which the kids love, but also to spend time with his new wife. The author wants to protect the kids from being with their father's new wife, even though she's now his legal wife.\n\nHmm. Legally, the ex has the right to have the kids with him, unless there are court orders restricting contact. Since they're divorced, the custody arrangement would determine where the kids spend the holidays. If the ex is allowed to have the kids, then the author lying to prevent that could be problematic. However, if the author has primary custody, maybe the ex's visitation is limited, but the author might have to be truthful about the kids' preferences.\n\nBut the author is lying about the kids' wishes. If the ex is within his rights to have the kids during his visitation, then the author is interfering with that. However, the author's motivation is to protect the kids from the new wife, who was the mistress. The author might feel that the kids shouldn't be exposed to the new wife, especially if there's a history of infidelity and ongoing emotional issues.\n\nBut lying about the kids' preferences is still a lie. Even if the motive is protection, the act of deception could be seen as wrong. However, some might argue that the ex's actions (cheating, manipulating with money) are the real issue, and the author is protecting the kids from a bad situation.\n\nAnother angle: the kids are 10 and 13. At 10, they're quite young, and 13 is a teenager. Their preferences might matter, but the author is making the decision for them. If the ex's plan was genuinely to take them to Japan for their interests, and the author is blocking it due to personal issues, that could be seen as prioritizing her own feelings over the kids' happiness.\n\nBut the author claims the ex is using the trip as a ploy to bond with the kids while being with his new wife. If there are concerns about the new wife's influence or the ex's manipulative behavior, the author might believe it's necessary to protect the kids.\n\nIn family law, the best interests of the child are paramount. If the author's actions are in the kids' best interests, perhaps it's justified. But if the court would typically allow visitation unless there's a threat to the children's well-being, the author might be overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions could be seen as both protective and deceptive. Whether she's in the wrong depends on the legal custody situation and the ethical stance on lying versus protecting children from a manipulative parent. If the ex's actions are legally okay, the author's lie is morally questionable. If the ex's actions are harmful, then the lie might be justified.\n"
