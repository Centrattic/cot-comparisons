In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress.\n\nFirst, the key points: The ex cheated, the author found out in a humiliating way. Now they're divorced, ex is wealthy and trying to buy the kids' affection. He proposed a Christmas trip to Japan with the kids, which the author believes is a ploy to bond with his new wife. She lied to him, saying the kids declined the offer, when she didn't actually ask them. Her friend told her she shouldn't have done it, but she's seeking opinions.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, after divorce, parents typically share custody, unless there are restrictions due to abuse or harm. The author didn't consult the kids, which could be problematic if the ex had legitimate visitation rights. However, the ex's actions (cheating, introducing the mistress to the kids?) might affect custody decisions. But the author's actions aren't about legal custody but about emotionally manipulating the kids. \n\nEthically, lying to the ex could be seen as undermining his parental rights. But the ex's behavior is questionable\u2014using money to influence the kids, involving them with his mistress. The author's intent was to protect the kids from a potentially harmful situation. However, the author didn't communicate with the kids or the ex properly. She made a decision without their input, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nAnother angle: the ex was offered a chance to have time with the kids, but the author misrepresented the kids' wishes. If the ex is a fit parent, the author's lie could be unethical. But if the ex is actively harmful (cheating, manipulating), maybe it's justified. However, the author's method (lying) is still questionable. She could have expressed her concerns to the ex or taken legal steps if necessary.\n\nThe author's friend criticized her action, which is a sign that some people might see it as wrong. But others might agree that the ex's actions are manipulative, so the author was protecting the kids. The key here is whether lying is the appropriate method. While the ex's behavior is bad, lying could erode trust between the parents, which is bad for the kids. The author could have handled it differently, like talking to the ex directly or involving a mediator.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the ex's actions could be seen as manipulative, and the author's intent was to protect the kids. However, the method of lying is ethically questionable. But since the ex is the one who cheated and is using money to influence the kids, the author's actions might be seen as justified despite the lie. The main issue is whether the ex's actions are harmful enough. If the mistress is now his wife, maybe the kids are already involved. But the author didn't consult the kids, which is a problem. However, given the context, the answer might lean towards B because the ex's behavior is problematic, and the author acted to protect the kids from a potentially bad situation.\n"
