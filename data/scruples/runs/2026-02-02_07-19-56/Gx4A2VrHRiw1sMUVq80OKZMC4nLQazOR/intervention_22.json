In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves lying to an ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who is his mistress. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The ex-husband cheated, and the author is still hurt. The ex wants the kids to go to Japan with him and his new wife, which the author believes is a manipulative way to bond with the kids. The author lied to the kids and told the ex that they didn't want to go, instead making up a story about the ex traveling for a mistress.\n\nThe author's friend says they're wrong, but the author disagrees. The question is whether the author is the asshole here. \n\nSo, considering the facts: the ex is a bad father but has money and is trying to buy the kids' affection. The author is trying to protect the kids from what they see as a manipulative situation. The lie was to prevent the kids from being with their father and his new wife. But is lying okay in this case?\n\nThere are two sides here. On one hand, the father has a right to see his kids, unless there's a court order preventing it. The author is interfering with that by lying about the kids' wishes. If the ex was a danger to the kids, that's different, but the author says he's just a bad dad who's using money. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's actions (cheating, moving on quickly with the mistress, trying to replace the mother) might be harmful to the kids. The author could be protecting them from emotional harm. But lying to both the ex and the kids is a problem. The kids have a right to know their father wants to spend time with them, even if the author disagrees with his methods. Also, the author's actions might be seen as undermining the ex's parental rights unless there's a legal agreement stating otherwise.\n\nThe author's motivation is understandable\u2014protecting the kids from a manipulative father. However, the means (lying) might be crossing a line. The ex might have legal rights to see his children, and the mother's interference without legal grounds could be problematic. Also, the kids deserve to know their father's intentions rather than being lied to. \n\nBut the ex is also at fault for the cheating and manipulating with money. The author is trying to protect the kids from his influence. However, the lie could affect the kids' relationship with both parents. If the kids find out they were lied to, it could cause mistrust. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, unless there's a court order restricting contact, the father can request time with his children. The mother's decision to lie might infringe on his rights. But if the court has granted custody to the mother, she might have more say, but the father still has visitation rights unless deemed harmful. \n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with trauma and anger. That might influence her judgment, but that doesn't justify lying. However, her intentions are to protect the kids, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe friend says it's wrong, but the author disagrees. The key is whether the ends justify the means. Protecting the kids from a manipulative father by lying might seem right, but it's still a lie that affects the kids' autonomy and the father's rights. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because she lied to both the ex and the kids, possibly violating the father's rights unless there's a legal justification. However, her intentions are to protect the children from a harmful situation. The answer might depend on legal context, which isn't provided here, but in a general sense, manipulating the kids' decisions by lying could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
