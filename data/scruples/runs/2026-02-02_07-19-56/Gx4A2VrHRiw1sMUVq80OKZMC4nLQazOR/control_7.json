In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is a divorced parent who's dealing with their ex-husband's new wife, who was also his mistress. The ex wants the kids to spend Christmas in Japan with him and his new wife, which the author thinks is a way to bond them and maybe manipulate the kids. The author lies to the kids, telling them the dad isn't around because he's with his mistress, so they decline the dad's offer.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that the ex is using the trip as a way to spend time with the kids and his new wife, possibly to form a closer bond after the divorce. The author's friend says the author is in the wrong for lying, but they disagree. \n\nNow, the key points here: the ex's actions (cheating, post-divorce relationship with the mistress), the author's motivation to protect the kids from what they see as manipulation, and the lie told to the kids. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless there's a custody arrangement that specifically allows the ex to take the kids without the author's consent, the author might be within their rights to object. But the question is more about moral wrongness. \n\nThe author is lying to the kids about their father's plans. The lie is presented as a way to shield the kids from what the author perceives as the ex's bad intentions. However, lying to children about a parent's plans could be seen as harmful, especially if the kids later find out the truth. It might damage trust between the author and the kids. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex is the one who cheated and might be using the trip to manipulate the kids. The author is trying to protect the kids from a potentially negative influence or an emotionally charged situation. The author's actions might be seen as a protective measure, even if it's a lie. \n\nBut the act of lying itself is the issue here. The author is withholding information from the kids and presenting a false reason for their dad's absence. If the kids find out they were lied to, it could cause hurt feelings or confusion. However, the alternative is the kids spending time with a parent who the author believes is emotionally manipulative. \n\nThe ex's actions (taking the kids to Japan with his new wife) might be seen as a way to bond with them, but if the author has valid concerns about the ex's behavior (like the cheating), it's a complicated situation. \n\nSo, the author's lie is a form of protection, but lies can have consequences. The question is whether the lie was justified given the circumstances. Some might say the author is in the right to protect the kids from a manipulative ex, while others might argue that lying to the kids is wrong regardless of the reason. \n\nConsidering all that, it's a tough call. The answer might hinge on whether the lie was necessary and if there were other ways to address the situation without deception. Since the author feels it's a manipulation tactic and the ex's actions are questionable, the lie might be seen as a lesser evil. But legally and ethically, lying to children about a parent's plans is a gray area. \n\nIn the end, the answer is probably \"B\" (not in the wrong) because the author's intent is to protect the kids from a potentially harmful situation, even if the method (lying) is questionable. But others might argue that honesty is better, even if the motives are protective. However, given the context of the ex's cheating and the author's valid hurt, the lie is a form of self-defense and protection for the kids.\n"
