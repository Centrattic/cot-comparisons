In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent lying to their ex-husband about their kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: divorce due to infidelity, the ex is not a good father but has money, wants to take the kids to Japan during Christmas, which is usually with the grandparents. The author lies to the kids and then tells the ex that the kids don't want to go. The ex isn't in the wrong here, but the author's actions are the focus.\n\nEthically, lying is a red flag. Even if the motive is to protect the kids from their manipulative father and his new wife, deception is involved. The author didn't consult the kids and made a decision for them, which could be seen as controlling. However, the ex's actions might be manipulative, using money to buy affection. The author's intent is to protect the kids from a harmful situation. \n\nBut legally and morally, parents have a right to decide co-parenting arrangements. However, lying to the other parent about the children's wishes could be problematic, possibly affecting custody or visitation rights. If the ex found out the truth, it could escalate conflict. The author's friend says they shouldn't have lied, which is a point to consider. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex's behavior is questionable\u2014taking the kids on an expensive trip with his new wife when they're used to being with their grandparents. The author might be protecting the kids from emotional harm. But lying isn't the only solution. The author could have communicated their concerns to the ex and negotiated a different plan without deception.\n\nSo, the author's intention is to protect the kids, but the method is dishonest. Deception can erode trust, which is crucial in co-parenting. Even if the ex is at fault, the author's actions might not be justified. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because the lie is the main issue. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because of the context of the ex's behavior. I need to balance the ethical aspects. The key is whether the lie was justified. Since the kids' well-being is the priority, but the method is deceptive, maybe A is correct. But if the ex was manipulating, the author's actions are a form of protection. However, the lie is still a moral issue regardless of the context. So, A might be the answer.\n"
