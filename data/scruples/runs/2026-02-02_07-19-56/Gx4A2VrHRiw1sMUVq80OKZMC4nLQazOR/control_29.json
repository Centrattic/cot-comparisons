In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The situation is about the ex wanting the kids to spend time with him and his new wife (who was his mistress) in Japan. The author didn't want the kids to go and instead said they wanted to stay with their grandparents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author's friend said they shouldn't have lied, but the author thinks they were just protecting the kids. The ex is using money to try to influence the kids, which the author sees as manipulative. \n\nThe author's main reason for lying is to prevent the kids from spending time with the ex's new wife, who they consider inappropriate. The ex isn't being a good father, but he has money. The author is worried about the ex's intentions and the potential emotional impact on the kids. \n\nOn one hand, lying isn't good. It can cause trust issues, especially when it comes to co-parenting. The ex might have a right to know the kids' preferences if he's involved in their lives. But on the other hand, the author is protecting the kids from a potentially harmful situation. They might feel that the ex's actions are still manipulative, and the author is trying to shield the kids from his influence. \n\nAlso, the kids are 10 and 13, which means they might not have the emotional maturity to handle being with their father and his new wife. The author is making a decision based on their own judgment of what's best for the kids. However, in a custody arrangement, both parents usually have a say, and withholding the kids' actual opinion could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut the author didn't lie to the kids, just to the ex. They told the ex the kids said no, when actually they didn't ask the kids. Maybe that's the key point. If the kids had a choice, the author is denying them that. However, if the author believes the ex is using the trip to manipulate the kids, they might think it's necessary to protect them, especially if the ex is acting in bad faith.\n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspects. Lying is generally wrong, but it's about protecting children from a manipulative parent. The ex's actions (cheating, trying to buy affection) are questionable. The author's intent was to prevent the kids from being manipulated, not to lie for personal gain. \n\nSo, in this case, the author's action could be seen as a protective measure rather than selfish. The ex might have a right to be involved, but if he's using the trip to form a new family while excluding the author, there's a conflict. The author's friend's opinion is that lying was wrong, but that's a common reaction without considering the full context. \n\nThe key is whether the author's lie was harmful. The kids ended up staying with their grandparents, which is a neutral decision. The ex might be upset, but he's the one who cheated and is now in a new relationship. The author's decision could be justified as acting in the kids' best interest, given the past manipulation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made a call to protect the kids from a manipulative situation, even if they used a lie to do so. The ex's behavior is the root issue here.\n"
