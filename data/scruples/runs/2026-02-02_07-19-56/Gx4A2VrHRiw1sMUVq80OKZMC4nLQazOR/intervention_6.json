In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a divorced parent, and the ex-husband cheated with a coworker who eventually became his wife. The kids are 10 and 13, and the ex only sees them twice a year. The author feels the ex isn't a good dad but has money and is trying to buy their love. The ex wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, which the author thinks is a manipulative ploy to spend time with them and his new wife. The author lied to the kids about the ex's plans, telling them he's unavailable because he's with his mistress, and told the ex that the kids said no.\n\nThe author's friend says they shouldn't have done it, but the author disagrees. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying to protect the kids from what they see as manipulation.\n\nFirst, consider the legal and custody aspects. If there's a custody agreement, the ex might have the right to take the kids on trips unless restricted. The author might be violating that by lying. But maybe the custody agreement allows for the author to have decision-making authority regarding the kids' schedules. However, the ex is asking to take them, so if the custody arrangement allows for it, maybe the author should have discussed it with the kids honestly.\n\nEthically, lying to the kids about the ex's plans could be harmful. Manipulating the truth, especially to protect them from a parent, might backfire. The kids might find out later and feel lied to, which could damage trust. Also, the author is making assumptions about the ex's intentions and the mistress's age (calling her \"barely legal\" when it's not clear if that's true), which could be unfair.\n\nBut the author's motivation is to protect the kids from what they perceive as manipulation and a toxic environment. The ex's behavior (cheating, using money to gain favor) is questionable. The author might think they're acting in the kids' best interest by not exposing them to the ex's new wife and his manipulative tactics.\n\nHowever, the legal right to decide where the kids go for holidays depends on custody agreements. If the ex has visitation rights, the author might be overstepping by lying. Also, lying to the kids could prevent them from making their own choices, which they might be capable of considering their ages.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own unresolved feelings from the divorce. They might be projecting their hurt onto the situation, using the kids as a buffer. The friend's criticism might be pointing out that the author's actions could be harmful in the long run, even if the intentions are good.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are to protect the kids, the method of lying could be unethical and potentially harmful. If the ex has legal rights to take the kids, the author might be violating those. However, if the author has primary custody and control over decisions, maybe it's their choice. But the deception towards the kids is a problem. So, the author might be in the wrong for lying, even if their motives are understandable.\n"
