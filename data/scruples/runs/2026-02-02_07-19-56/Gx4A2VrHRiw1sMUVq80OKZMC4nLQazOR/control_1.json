In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is about the author lying to their ex-husband about where the kids wanted to spend Christmas. The ex wants the kids to go to Japan with him and his new wife (who was his mistress), and the author didn't want the kids to go. The author lied and told the ex that the kids said no, instead of telling them the truth.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated with someone who worked for him, which is a big betrayal. The author is still hurt, and the ex is now trying to bond with the kids through expensive trips. The author thinks this is a manipulation tactic to get the kids to spend time with him and his new wife, which the author is against. The author didn't tell the kids about the offer and just told the ex that the kids declined.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying. Let's consider the key points. The author's actions were motivated by protecting the kids from their father's new wife, whom they consider a mistress. The ex is using money to try to buy the kids' affection, which the author resents. The author's lie was to prevent the kids from going on the trip. The ex wasn't in the country and wasn't present for the kids' usual Christmas with grandparents.\n\nNow, legal custody matters. If the ex has legal custody or visitation rights, the author might be overstepping by not allowing the kids to go. But if the author has primary custody and the ex's visitation is limited, then maybe the author has more say. However, the author is the one making decisions about the kids' time without consulting them, which could be harmful if the kids actually wanted to go.\n\nBut the author's friend says they shouldn't have lied. The author's reasoning is that the ex is manipulative and trying to use the trip to bond with the kids and his new wife. The author might believe it's for the kids' best interest to avoid that scenario. However, lying to the ex could be seen as undermining the co-parenting agreement or not being honest, which could affect the kids if the ex later finds out or if the kids feel misled.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the kids have always spent Christmas with grandparents. Maybe there's a precedent, and changing that could be a big deal. But the author's decision was based on protecting the kids from the ex's new wife and potential emotional harm. The ex is described as not a good father but has money to buy the kids' love. The author is trying to protect the kids from a potentially harmful situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex might have a right to spend time with the kids, and the author is denying him that by lying. But if the ex's behavior is harmful (like involving the mistress), the author might be justified in stepping in. However, the author should ideally communicate with the ex honestly, even if it's difficult.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key factors are the children's best interest, the legal custody arrangement, and the author's intent. If the author is acting in the kids' best interest to protect them from a manipulative ex and a potentially harmful situation, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the lie is preventing the kids from making their own choice or if the ex has rights to visitation, the author could be overstepping. However, given the context of the ex's behavior and the author's justified anger, the lie might be seen as a protective measure rather than an act of selfishness. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
