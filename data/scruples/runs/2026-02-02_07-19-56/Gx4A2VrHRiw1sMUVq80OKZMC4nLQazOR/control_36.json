In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their ex about the kids' Christmas plans. The ex cheated with a coworker, leading to a divorce. Now the ex wants the kids to go to Japan with him and his new wife, but the author lies to the kids, saying the ex isn't available because he's with the mistress. The author's friend says they shouldn't have done that, but the author thinks they're protecting the kids from the ex's manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child custody post-divorce usually requires cooperation unless there's a court order restricting contact. If the ex has legal rights to visitation, the author might be interfering. But if there's a court order in place limiting contact due to the cheating and the ex's behavior, then the author might be justified. \n\nThe author mentions the ex isn't a good father but has money. The ex's actions could be seen as trying to bond with the kids through expensive gifts. The author's lie is to prevent the kids from going, which they see as a ploy. However, lying to the kids about their father could be harmful. The kids have a right to know about their father's plans, even if the father's behavior is questionable. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's emotional state. They mention it's still raw from the divorce. Their actions might stem from protecting the kids from a bad situation, but deception could backfire if the kids find out later. The ex might also feel wronged if the author is blocking his access without legal grounds. \n\nIn terms of ethics, lying to protect the kids from a manipulative parent could be seen as a protective measure. However, in a legal context, unless there's a court order or immediate harm, withholding information might not be justified. The ex's new wife was previously a mistress, which could be a sensitive issue for the kids if they find out. The author's friend's criticism suggests that honesty is better, even if the situation is difficult.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a mix of protecting the kids and possibly violating legal or ethical standards. If there's no legal restriction, the author might be overstepping. But if the ex's behavior is harmful, the author might be protecting the kids. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. However, the act of lying to the kids about the father's availability is questionable, as it withholds information from the children and might prevent them from making their own choice. The answer hinges on the presence of legal constraints and the potential harm of the ex's actions versus the harm of the lie.\n"
