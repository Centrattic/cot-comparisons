In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a divorced parent lying to their ex about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas to avoid them spending time with the ex's new wife, who was his mistress. The ex is portrayed as someone who cheated, and now the kids only see him twice a year. The author is trying to protect the kids from what they see as a manipulative situation where the ex is using money to buy the kids' affection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to have a relationship with their children unless there's a court order restricting visitation. The ex isn't necessarily restricted from seeing the kids; they just have limited time. The author's lie could be seen as interfering with the other parent's custody rights. But if there's a custody agreement, maybe there are specific rules about how decisions are made. If the author has primary custody, they might have more say, but the ex's time is still part of the arrangement.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is acting out of concern for the kids' well-being, trying to protect them from a potentially harmful dynamic. The ex's actions might be problematic\u2014using money to gain favor with the children could be manipulative. The author's lie is intended to shield the kids from that, but lying to the children themselves isn't addressed here. The author didn't tell the kids about the offer, which might affect their autonomy. However, the kids are 10 and 13, so their ability to make such a decision might be limited, and the parent is making the judgment call.\n\nThe author's friend is critical, suggesting that lying is wrong. But the author's rationale is based on protecting the kids from a manipulative situation. The ex's history of cheating and the current situation with the new wife could be valid concerns. However, the author's method of handling it through deception might not be the best approach. Legal advice might be necessary if there's a conflict over custody or visitation rights.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author is still dealing with the pain of the divorce and betrayal. Their actions could be influenced by lingering hurt and a desire to prevent the kids from being exposed to what they perceive as further manipulation. However, the kids' best interests should be the priority. If the ex is genuinely manipulative, there might be a case for protecting the kids, but doing so through a lie could backfire if the kids find out the truth later.\n\nIn family law, courts typically encourage both parents to maintain a relationship with their children unless there's evidence of harm. The author's actions might be seen as undermining the ex's parental rights unless there's a legal basis for restricting contact. The ex's behavior, like taking the kids to Japan with his new wife, could be a point of contention. If there's no court order preventing this, the author's interference might not be legally justified, even if ethically they believe it's right.\n\nUltimately, the question hinges on whether the author's actions were justified to protect the children from a harmful situation. If the ex is indeed manipulative and the author has reason to believe that the kids are being exploited, then the lie might be seen as a protective measure. However, if there's no legal barrier and the ex is within his rights, the author might be overstepping. The answer depends on the context of their custody arrangement and the specific behaviors of the ex, but ethically, there's a gray area where intentions are protective but the method is deceptive.\n"
