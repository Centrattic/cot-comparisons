In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The author's ex cheated, they're divorced, and the ex now has a new wife, who was the mistress. The ex wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, but the author lies and says the kids don't want to go, so they can stay with grandparents instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to have a relationship with their children unless a court decides otherwise. The author is preventing the ex from spending time with the kids, which might be against custody agreements. If there's no legal agreement, maybe the author can decide, but if the ex has visitation rights, interfering could be problematic.\n\nEmotionally, the author is hurt from the cheating and the ex's behavior. They might feel protective, but lying could be seen as manipulative. The ex is using money to try to buy the kids' affection, which is bad, but cutting off their access entirely might not be the right approach. The author's friend says they shouldn't have lied, which adds another perspective.\n\nThe kids' well-being is key. If the ex is a bad father, maybe the kids are better off with grandparents. But if the ex has legal rights, the author should handle this through proper channels rather than lying. Also, the kids' wishes might matter\u2014should the author have considered their input more honestly?\n\nThe ex's actions are definitely questionable, but the author's response might not be the best solution. Lying could lead to more conflict and possibly legal issues. Maybe the better approach is to communicate honestly, set boundaries, or seek mediation instead of deception.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they prevented the ex from spending time with the kids without legal grounds, even if the ex's behavior is bad. The right approach is to handle it through proper means rather than lying.\n"
