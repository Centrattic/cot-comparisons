In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: the author and her ex are divorced, and he cheated on her with a coworker, who is now his wife. The kids are 10 and 13, and they've spent Christmas with the author's parents every year since they were babies. The ex wants to take them to Japan for Christmas, but the author thinks it's a ploy to get the kids to bond with the new stepmom, who was his mistress. The author lies to her ex, telling him the kids don't want to go and will stay with the grandparents instead.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The ex has a history of infidelity, and the author is still hurt. The kids' well-being is a priority. The ex is using money to buy their affection, which might not be healthy. The author's lie was to prevent the kids from being exposed to the new wife, whom she considers the mistress. However, the ex has legal rights as a parent, and the kids might have a right to spend time with him. But since the kids are with the grandparents every year, maybe the author is acting in their best interest by maintaining the status quo.\n\nOn the other hand, lying could be seen as manipulative, even if the intent is good. The ex might feel that he's being denied a relationship with his children. The author's friend says she's wrong, but the author believes she's protecting the kids from a potentially harmful situation. There's a conflict between the ex's parental rights and the author's desire to shield the kids from the new wife. \n\nThe key points are: the ex's actions in the past (cheating) and the author's motivation (protecting kids from a manipulative situation). If the ex is a bad father, but the author is lying to prevent that, it's a tough call. The line between protecting children and denying their father's rights is thin. However, the author might argue that the ex's new wife was the mistress, and exposing the kids to that could be traumatic. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, AITA (Am I the Asshole) often considers intent and potential harm. The author's intent was to protect, which is a common justification. However, the method (lying) could be questionable. If the ex had a legitimate right to spend time with the kids, then the author's lie might be seen as undermining that. But if the ex's actions are manipulative and harmful, then the lie serves a protective role. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were justified based on the ex's behavior. Since the ex cheated and is now trying to buy the kids' affection, the author might believe she's acting in the kids' best interest. However, without legal custody issues mentioned, the ex does have a right to be involved. But given the manipulation and the kids' established tradition, the author's lie could be seen as a necessary measure. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
