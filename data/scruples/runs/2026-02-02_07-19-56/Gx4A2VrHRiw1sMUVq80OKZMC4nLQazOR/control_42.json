In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is the ex-wife of someone who cheated on her with a coworker, now wants to prevent her kids from spending Christmas with their dad and his new wife. The dad is taking them to Japan for a Christmas trip, and the author lies to her kids about it, telling them their dad isn't around because he's with his new wife. She tells her ex that the kids said no, but the truth is she didn't even ask them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to have their children, even after divorce. Unless there's a court order preventing contact, the dad might have the right to take the kids. The author lying about the kids' preferences could interfere with that right. But there's also the context of infidelity and the dad's behavior. If he's not a fit parent due to manipulation or other issues, maybe the court would support the mother's actions. However, the author didn't go through legal channels; she just lied.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal and ongoing pain. Her actions are driven by a desire to protect the kids from what she sees as manipulation and a new stepmother who's an ex-mistress. But is it her place to decide without consulting the kids? The kids are 10 and 13, so they might have their own opinions, and not being asked could leave them confused or hurt if they find out the truth later. The author's friend says she shouldn't have done it, which adds another perspective that maybe lying isn't the right approach, even if the motive is protective.\n\nThe ex is portrayed as someone who isn't a good father but has money. He might be trying to buy the kids' affection, which the author is trying to prevent. However, lying to the kids and the ex could backfire if the ex finds out, leading to more conflict. There's also the issue of honesty with the children. If they find out they were lied to, it could damage trust with the mother, especially if they value their father's side.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author's intention is to protect her children from a situation she deems harmful. But the method\u2014lying\u2014could be seen as a moral problem regardless of intent. It's a classic dilemma between doing what's right versus what's kind or necessary. The ex's actions might be questionable, but the author's response bypasses legal processes and honest communication.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are driven by protecting her children, but the method involves deception. Whether that makes her the asshole depends on societal views on parental rights and the ethics of lying to protect children versus upholding the other parent's rights. If the dad's actions are legally permissible and the author's deception interferes without legal basis, then she might be in the wrong. However, if there's a valid reason to believe the dad is unfit, maybe her actions are justified. But since the situation isn't in court and she's choosing to lie, it's tricky. The friend's perspective suggests that lying is not the right approach. So, leaning towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she lied, but there's a strong argument for B (No) due to the circumstances. However, the act of lying itself is a clear breach of honesty, which is why A might be the correct answer here.\n"
