In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. The ex is now married to his mistress, and the author doesn't want the kids to spend time with him. She lied to her ex by telling him the kids said no, when in reality she didn't even ask them and just assumed they'd prefer staying with their grandparents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's ex is a manipulative figure here, using money to try to gain favor with the kids. The author feels hurt and betrayed, especially given the cheating and the current relationship with the mistress. She might see protecting the kids from their father as a necessary act, even if it's dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, lying to the kids and the ex could have consequences. The kids might find out later that their mother lied, which could affect their trust in her. Also, the ex might feel that his parenting rights are being undermined. However, the ex isn't exactly a model parent, as the author describes him as not being a good father but using money to buy affection.\n\nThe key points here: the author's motivation was to protect the kids from what she perceives as her ex's manipulation. But is lying the right approach? In family law and co-parenting situations, transparency is usually important. However, if there's a history of abuse or manipulation, courts sometimes take sides. \n\nBut the question isn't about legalities; it's about whether the author is an asshole. The author's actions were driven by her past trauma and a desire to protect her children. While lying isn't ideal, the context of the ex's behavior might justify it. However, the author didn't even ask the kids, so she assumed their wishes. That could be seen as not respecting the kids' autonomy. But given the ex's actions, maybe the author felt it was necessary to protect them.\n\nSo, should the author be in the wrong? If the ex is abusive or manipulative, then the author's lie could be a protective measure. But if the ex is a legitimate co-parent with rights, then the lie could be seen as crossing a line. The situation is complex. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as justified given the ex's behavior. Since the ex is described as using money to buy the kids' affection and being a bad father, the author's actions might be viewed as a necessary evil. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
