In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and her ex are divorced. The ex cheated with a coworker who is now his wife. The kids are 10 and 13, and the ex wants them to spend Christmas in Japan with him and his new wife. The author lies to her ex, telling him the kids don't want to go, so they can stay with her parents instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex cheated, which is a big deal. The author feels hurt and betrayed. Now he's trying to spend Christmas with the kids, which the author thinks is a way to bond with them, using his money. But the author is worried about the kids being with his new wife, who was the mistress. The author decides not to tell the kids about the trip offer and lies to her ex, saying the kids declined.\n\nThe question is whether lying was wrong. On one hand, the author might feel that protecting the kids from a potentially harmful situation (spending time with their dad's mistress) is necessary. She might also feel that the ex's actions are manipulative, trying to buy the kids' affection. On the other hand, lying might not be the best approach because the kids have a right to know their father wants to spend time with them. Also, the author is making a decision without involving the kids' input, which could be seen as controlling or not respecting their wishes.\n\nAnother angle is custody and legal arrangements. If the ex has visitation rights, the author might not have the legal right to unilaterally decide against them. But since the kids spend time with grandparents usually, maybe there's a pattern. However, the ex's behavior (cheating, buying love) complicates things. The author's friend says she's wrong, but the author disagrees.\n\nI need to weigh the ethics here. Lying to prevent something the author perceives as harmful could be seen as protective, but it's still a lie. The ex might have a right to be in his kids' lives, even if his methods are questionable. The author's actions might prevent the kids from experiencing a different family dynamic or bonding with their father. However, the father's actions (cheating, moving on quickly) could impact the kids negatively. \n\nHmm. The author's intention was to protect the kids from what she sees as an inappropriate situation. But is lying the right way? Maybe there's a better approach, like involving a mediator or discussing with the kids. But since the kids are minors, maybe the parent has the authority to make such decisions. Still, the ex's rights as a parent might also need to be considered. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author feels justified because of the past betrayal. But others might argue that the ex has a right to time with the kids, and the author shouldn't be making decisions based on her own anger. Also, the ex's new wife was his coworker and the mistress, but now legally married. Does that change things? Maybe the author is holding a grudge. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the lie was to protect the kids from harm or to satisfy the author's own feelings. If the former, maybe it's understandable. If the latter, then it's wrong. The author mentions the kids love Japanese stuff, so maybe the trip could have been good for them. But she's blocking it because of her own hurt. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key factors: the author's justification for the lie, the ex's rights as a parent, the potential impact on the kids. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the ex's actions were manipulative and the author's intention was to protect the kids from a harmful situation. However, some might argue that the author should have found a different way, like discussing with the kids or finding a middle ground. But given the context of the ex's cheating and trying to buy the kids' love, the author's actions might be seen as justified.\n"
