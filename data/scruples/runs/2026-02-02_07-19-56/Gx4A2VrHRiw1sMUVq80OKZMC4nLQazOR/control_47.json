In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent lying to their ex about their kids not wanting to spend Christmas with him and his new wife. The ex-husband cheated, the author is still hurt, and they believe the ex is trying to manipulate the kids by taking them to Japan with his new wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have rights to their children post-divorce, and decisions about custody and visitation are usually determined by the children's best interests. The author didn't consult the kids and instead made up their response. That could be problematic because the kids have the right to maintain a relationship with both parents unless there's a court order preventing it. The ex taking the kids to Japan might be within his rights if it's part of his custody agreement or agreed upon in their divorce settlement.\n\nThe author's motivation is understandable\u2014protecting the kids from the ex's new wife and the ex's manipulative behavior. However, lying about the kids' wishes could interfere with the ex's parenting rights. The ex might have the legal right to take the kids, even if the author disagrees with his decisions. Also, the author's ex is now married to the mistress, which complicates things, but legally, unless there's a restraining order or court order affecting custody, the ex can have the kids.\n\nThe author's friend says they shouldn't have lied, which adds another layer. The author might be projecting their own hurt and anger onto the situation, thinking they're protecting the kids, but the kids might have wanted to go. The author's actions could prevent the kids from experiencing something they wanted, like visiting Japan, which they're interested in. Also, lying might not be the best approach; perhaps a more constructive method would be to express concerns through legal channels or mediation if there are valid reasons to oppose the visit.\n\nHowever, if the author has legitimate concerns about the ex's parenting\u2014like the ex being a manipulative figure or the new stepmother not being suitable\u2014it's possible that the author is trying to protect the kids from a harmful situation. But without legal proof or a court order, the author can't unilaterally decide the kids' visits. Their actions could be seen as overstepping if they're preventing the ex from exercising parental rights without a legal basis.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are to protect the kids, the act of lying and withholding information from the ex might infringe on the ex's parental rights. Unless there are legal reasons to prevent the visit, the author's actions could be considered overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they manipulated the situation without a legal basis, even if their motives were protective.\n"
