In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about where the kids wanted to go for Christmas to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are divorced, and the author is still emotionally hurt from the cheating. The ex-husband is trying to have the kids with him and his new wife for Christmas, which the author sees as a manipulation tactic. She lied about the kids' preferences to keep them from going.\n\nThe key points here are the children's well-being, the legal custody arrangements, and the ethical implications of lying. If there's a custody agreement that requires both parents to agree on major decisions, the author might be violating that by unilaterally making the decision. However, if the kids have been spending Christmases with the author's parents since birth, maybe the current arrangement is established and the ex is trying to change it without proper agreement.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling hurt, but the kids' best interests should be the priority. However, the author's decision to lie could be seen as manipulative too, even if her intentions are good. The ex might be using the kids as leverage, but the author's response is also a form of leverage. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the kids' wishes. At 10 and 13, they might have their own preferences, and the author is making a choice without their input, which could affect their autonomy. The friend's criticism might stem from the idea that honesty is important, even if the ex is at fault.\n\nBut considering the ex's history of infidelity and the new wife being his mistress, the author might be protecting the kids from a potentially uncomfortable or harmful situation. However, the right approach might have been to communicate with the ex or involve a mediator rather than lying.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, lying to a co-parent can complicate custody issues and set a bad example for the kids. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the co-parenting relationship, especially if there's a shared custody agreement. On the other hand, the ex's behavior is questionable, using money to influence the kids and the kids might not want to go with him.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author's intent was to protect the kids, but the method of lying might be ethically questionable. However, given the ex's manipulative behavior, some might argue the ends justify the means. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for lying, especially if it affects the kids' ability to make their own choices or if it causes future legal issues.\n"
