In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a mom who's divorced from her ex-husband, who cheated on her with a coworker, and now they're married. The kids are 10 and 13, and the ex wants them to come to Japan for Christmas. The mom didn't tell them about the offer and lied, saying the kids said no. The question is whether she's in the wrong for lying to protect them from their dad's new wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since they're divorced, custody arrangements might dictate who can decide where the kids spend holidays. If the mom has sole custody or primary custody, she might have the authority to make such decisions. But if there's a shared custody arrangement, the ex might have a say. However, the mom mentions they only see the kids twice a year, which might indicate he has limited custody. That could mean her decisions are within her rights.\n\nEmotionally, the mom is still hurt from the cheating and seeing her ex with the mistress. She's trying to protect the kids from what she perceives as manipulation. The ex is described as not a good father but has money, so the trip to Japan might be a way to buy the kids' affection. The mom's action is a lie, but her intention is to prevent the kids from being exposed to the mistress and to maintain their usual holiday routine with grandparents. \n\nHowever, lying about the kids' wishes could be seen as manipulating the situation herself. The kids might have wanted to go to Japan, especially since they love Japanese stuff. The mom didn't give them a choice, which could affect their autonomy. But on the other hand, the ex's intentions might be manipulative, so the mom is trying to shield the kids from that.\n\nEthically, the mom is protecting the kids from a potentially harmful situation, but she's also being dishonest. The friend's perspective is that the mom shouldn't have lied, maybe because the kids should have the choice. But the mom's reasoning is that the ex's offer isn't in the kids' best interest. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the mom's actions are based on her belief that the ex is trying to manipulate the kids, then her lie might be seen as a protective measure. However, withholding information and lying could damage trust if the kids find out later. But considering the ex's history of cheating and the current situation, the mom might be justified in her actions to protect the children's well-being.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on how you weigh the intent versus the action. If the intent is to protect the kids, some might see it as justified. Others might argue that honesty is important and that the mom should have found another way to handle the situation, like consulting a mediator or discussing with the ex. But given the context of the ex's behavior and the mom's protective instincts, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
