In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their ex about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas, to prevent them from spending time with the ex's mistress, who is now his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex cheated with a coworker, who later became his wife. The kids are 10 and 13, and they usually spend Christmas with their grandparents. The ex wants to take them to Japan, which the author thinks is a ploy to bond with them and the new wife. The author lied to the ex, saying the kids don't want to go, and told the kids their dad is away with his new wife. The friend said it was wrong, but the author disagrees.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex's actions (cheating, now with the mistress as wife), the author's motivation (protecting kids from the ex's manipulative plans), the lie told to the ex, and the deception towards the kids about the ex's whereabouts.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author's main concern is protecting the kids from the ex's manipulative behavior. The ex is using money to buy their affection, which the author is against. But lying to the ex could be seen as a form of deception, which might be problematic. However, the author's intention is to protect the children from a potentially harmful situation, especially considering the ex's history.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are not old enough to make such decisions on their own. The author is the custodial parent, so making decisions about their time with the ex is part of their responsibility. The ex is only involved twice a year, which might be part of the custody agreement. The author's friend thinks the lie is wrong, but the author's action is to shield the kids from the ex's manipulative intentions.\n\nThere's also the question of honesty. The author lied to the ex, which is a factor. However, the ex has a history of betrayal and manipulation. The author is trying to prevent the ex from forming a bond with the kids through expensive gifts and time, which could be hurtful given the history. The author's deception is to protect the kids from emotional harm.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have informed the kids about the situation. The author didn't tell them about the ex's offer and instead told them the ex was away with his new wife. This might be considered lying to the kids as well, but the intention is to protect them from knowing about the affair or the ex's manipulative plans. However, withholding the truth from children can have its own issues, but given the age of the kids, maybe it's a judgment call.\n\nIn terms of the law, if the ex has custody rights, the author might need to follow legal guidelines. But since the ex only sees the kids twice a year, maybe the author has more leeway. However, the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing, not legal. The friend's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but the user is asking for a different perspective.\n\nConsidering the ex's actions (cheating, moving on with the mistress, using money to gain favor), the author's lie seems like a protective measure. The ex knows the kids like Japanese culture, so the trip is a calculated move to gain their affection. The author is countering that by not allowing the trip, which could be seen as justified to protect the kids from a potentially harmful influence and to prevent the ex from manipulating them through gifts.\n\nSo, in summary, the author's actions are motivated by a desire to protect the children from a manipulative parent and a stepmother who was previously his mistress. The lie is a strategic move to avoid enabling the ex's behavior. While lying is generally frowned upon, in this context, the intent is protective, which might outweigh the ethical issue of deception. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
