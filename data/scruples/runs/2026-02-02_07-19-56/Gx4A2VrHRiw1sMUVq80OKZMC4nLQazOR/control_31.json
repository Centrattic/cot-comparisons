In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The ex cheated, the kids are with the author most of the time, and the ex wants to take them to Japan with his new wife. The author felt this was manipulative, so she lied to the kids and told the ex they said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex cheated, leading to divorce, and the author still feels hurt. The ex is trying to connect with the kids by taking them to Japan, which the author sees as a ploy. The kids have always spent Christmas with the author's parents. The question is whether lying was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting the kids from what she perceives as the ex's manipulative behavior. The ex's new wife was his mistress, so there's a history of betrayal. The author might believe that the ex is using money to gain favor with the kids. In this case, her actions could be seen as protective.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex has legal rights as a parent. The author is making a decision without the kids' input, which might not be fair to them. The kids might have wanted to go to Japan, but the author decided not to let them know the offer. Also, lying to the ex could damage any future co-parenting efforts, leading to more conflict.\n\nThe author's friend says she shouldn't have done it, suggesting that honesty is better, even if the intentions are good. However, the author's motivation was to protect the kids from a situation she views as harmful. There's a balance between protecting children and respecting the other parent's rights.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, co-parents are generally encouraged to communicate openly and honestly for the children's best interest. However, if one parent is abusive or manipulative, there might be exceptions. The key factors are the children's well-being and the ex's behavior.\n\nSince the ex was unfaithful and the author is protecting the kids from what she sees as a manipulative move, it's a complex situation. The author's actions are driven by protecting the kids, but it's a lie that could affect future interactions. However, if the ex is indeed being manipulative and the author has valid concerns, her lie might be understandable from a protective standpoint.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's acting out of concern for her children's emotional well-being and preventing potential harm from the ex's manipulative actions.\n"
