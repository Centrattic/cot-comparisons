In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by lying to her ex about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. The key points here are the ex's history of cheating, the current situation where the ex is trying to reconnect with the kids through expensive trips with his new wife, and the mother's decision to lie to prevent that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, both parents have the right to be involved in their children's lives post-divorce, especially if there's a custody agreement. If the ex had the legal right to take the kids without the mother's consent, then the mother's lie might interfere with that. However, if there's a custody arrangement that requires mutual agreement, the situation changes. The original story mentions that the kids spend Christmas with their grandparents, which might be part of a custody or visitation plan. If the ex was supposed to have a say in where the kids spend the holidays, the mother's lie could be problematic legally.\n\nNext, the emotional impact on the kids. The mother is protecting the children from seeing their father with his new wife, which she views as a manipulative move. But by lying, she's keeping the kids in the dark about their father's intentions. This could lead to confusion or mistrust if the kids find out later. On the other hand, exposing them to a potentially uncomfortable or manipulative situation might also be harmful. The mother's intention is protective, but the method is deceptive.\n\nThe ex's behavior is questionable\u2014he cheated, now he's with his mistress, and he's using money to buy affection. However, the children might deserve the relationship with both parents unless there's a legal or safety issue. The mother's lie could prevent that, which raises ethical questions. Is it right to keep the kids from their father, even if he's flawed? Or is it acceptable to protect them from a manipulative scenario?\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the mother was wrong, which the user is considering. The mother believes she's justified because she's protecting her kids. But lying can have consequences. The ex might feel his parental rights are being disregarded, leading to legal conflict. The kids might also feel they're being manipulated by both parents if they learn the truth.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's a gray area. The mother's actions are driven by protecting her children, but deception is involved. The ex's actions are also manipulative, but he might have a right to a relationship with his children. The mother's lie could be seen as a form of manipulation as well. Whether she's in the wrong depends on the balance between protecting the kids and respecting the ex's rights.\n\nLegally, if there's a custody arrangement that allows the ex to take the kids without the mother's consent, the mother's lie could be a violation. If not, then it might be justified. Since the story doesn't specify custody details, it's hard to say, but the mother's decision to lie without consulting the kids directly might be ethically questionable. Honesty is usually valued in parenting, even when the truth is difficult.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the mother's actions are a mix of protection and deception. The right answer hinges on the specifics of legal custody and the potential harm to the children in both scenarios. Since the mother is the one actively deceiving, even with good intentions, it could be seen as her being in the wrong (A), but if the ex's behavior is truly manipulative, then maybe not (B). Given the information, I lean towards A because lying to prevent a parent from seeing their children, unless there's a legal barrier, is generally considered wrong, even if the parent's actions are questionable.\n"
