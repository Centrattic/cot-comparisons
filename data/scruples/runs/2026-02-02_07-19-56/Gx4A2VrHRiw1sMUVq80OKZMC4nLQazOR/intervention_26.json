In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a parent who divorced their ex-husband three years ago. The ex cheated on them with a coworker, which was later revealed during a work event where the author was humiliated. Now the ex is married to his mistress and the kids only see him twice a year. The ex is described as not a good father but has money and is trying to buy their kids' love. This year, the ex proposed taking the kids to Japan for Christmas, which they love, but the author wasn't invited. The ex asked the author to check with the kids if they wanted to go. The author lied to the kids, not telling them about the offer, and told the ex the kids said no, preferring to stay with their grandparents. The author's friend says they shouldn't have lied, but the author disagrees and is asking if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nSo the core question is whether lying to the kids to prevent them from going on a trip with their father and stepmom is the right thing to do. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the legal and custody aspects. If the ex has custody rights or if the parents have a custody agreement, the author might need to consider that. But since the ex is only seeing the kids twice a year, maybe the custody is shared or the ex has limited visitation. The author might have the right to make decisions about the kids' time if it's within their custodial agreement. However, even if they have that right, lying to the kids could be a problem.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. They felt the ex was manipulating the kids by using their interest in Japanese culture to get them to spend time with him. The author might believe the ex is using money to gain favor with the kids, and that the stepmom is a negative influence. The author's intention was to protect the kids from what they see as a manipulative situation. But is lying to the kids the appropriate way to do that?\n\nParenting during and after a divorce can be challenging, especially when there's ongoing conflict. The author's actions could be seen as trying to shield the kids from a potentially harmful situation. However, lying to children, especially about such a significant family matter, might have its own negative consequences. The kids might feel betrayed if they find out the truth later, which could damage their trust in the parent who lied.\n\nAnother angle is the ex's behavior. The ex cheated, which is a serious issue, and now the author is trying to prevent the kids from being influenced by his new wife. The author's friend thinks they shouldn't have lied, implying that transparency is better, even if the parent disapproves of the ex's actions. But maybe the author believes that the ex is not a good father and that the kids are better off not spending extended time with him. However, even if the ex is not a good father, the kids have a right to a relationship with both parents unless there are legal restrictions or safety concerns.\n\nThe author's decision to lie might be seen as undermining the ex's parental rights, depending on the custody arrangement. If the ex is legally allowed to have visitation, the author might not have the right to interfere by lying. But if the custody agreement is more flexible, perhaps the author has some leeway. However, the ethical question remains: is it right to lie to the children about such a matter?\n\nIn terms of the kids' well-being, the author is trying to protect them from a situation they perceive as negative. But by lying, the author might be preventing the kids from making their own choice, which could be an important part of their autonomy. If the kids wanted to go to Japan and see their father, even if the author thinks it's a bad idea, the kids might still have their own judgment. The author's actions could lead to resentment from the kids later on if they discover the lie.\n\nAlso, the author's emotional state is important. The divorce is still raw, and there's a history of betrayal and humiliation. The author might be acting out of hurt and a desire to protect the kids from a situation that triggers their own trauma. However, the kids' feelings and their right to a relationship with their father (assuming no legal barriers) might be a counterpoint to that.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are driven by a desire to protect the kids from what they see as a manipulative and harmful situation. However, the method\u2014lying to the kids\u2014could be ethically questionable. The key factors are the legal custody rights, the kids' autonomy, the potential for trust issues if the lie is discovered, and the underlying motivations. Without knowing the exact custody agreement, it's hard to say if the author is legally in the wrong, but ethically, lying to prevent the kids from having a visitation they might want to take could be problematic. The author's friend's perspective suggests that honesty is better, even if it's uncomfortable, because it allows the kids to make their own decisions and builds trust.\n"
