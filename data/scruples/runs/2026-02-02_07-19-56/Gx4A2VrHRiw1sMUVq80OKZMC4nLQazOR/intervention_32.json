In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress. The author and ex are divorced, and the ex is accused of not being a good father but has money. The key points here are custody arrangements, the author's reasons for the lie, and the potential impact on the children.\n\nFirst, in most cases, after a divorce, both parents usually have some form of custody or visitation rights unless a court has restricted it. If the ex is legally allowed to have time with the kids, the author's lie might interfere with that. However, if there were legal issues like the ex's infidelity affecting custody, maybe there are existing court orders. But the scenario doesn't mention any legal constraints, so assuming equal rights, lying to prevent visitation could be problematic.\n\nThe author claims the ex is using money to buy the kids' affection and that the ex's new wife is manipulative. The ex's intent might be to bond with the kids, but the author's actions are based on distrust. However, withholding the truth from the kids about their father's plans could be harmful. The kids might feel lied to or confused later, especially if they find out the truth. The author's justification is to protect them from a manipulative situation, but is that her role anymore after divorce? Typically, parents are supposed to facilitate the kids' relationship with the other parent unless there's a valid safety concern.\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author is wrong. The author's actions could be seen as manipulative too, even if with good intentions. The line between protecting and controlling can be thin. If the ex isn't a fit parent, maybe the author has a case, but the scenario doesn't provide evidence of that beyond the infidelity. The author's actions might be based on personal hurt and ongoing resentment rather than the kids' best interests.\n\nIn terms of the kids' well-being, being kept in the dark might not be helpful. They might have wanted to visit Japan, especially if they like Japanese culture. The author's decision could deprive them of a potentially positive experience, even if the ex's motives are questionable. Unless there's proof of harm, interfering with a parent's time could be ethically and legally questionable.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because she's undermining the ex's parental rights without clear justification. However, the ex's behavior (cheating, using money to manipulate) could be factors in a custody dispute. But since the author is the one actively lying to block the visit, that's a key point. The answer likely hinges on whether there are legal restrictions or evidence of the ex's unfit behavior. Without that, the author's actions are deceitful and harmful.\n"
