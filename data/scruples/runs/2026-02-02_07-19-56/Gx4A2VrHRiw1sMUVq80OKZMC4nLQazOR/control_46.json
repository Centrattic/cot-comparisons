In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about her kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress. \n\nFirst, the key points: The ex cheated, the author found out in a humiliating way. They divorced three years ago, but it's still raw. The ex is trying to win the kids over with expensive trips, and the author lies to the kids about the trip being unavailable to keep them from going. The friend says she's in the wrong, but the author disagrees.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have custody rights unless a court has determined otherwise. If the ex has visitation rights or shared custody, then the author might be interfering with his legal rights by lying. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing, not legal.\n\nEthically, the author is protecting her kids from what she perceives as manipulation by their father and his new wife. She's shielding them from a potentially harmful situation. The ex's intentions are questionable, using money to gain favor with the kids. The author's lie is to prevent that, which she sees as necessary for the kids' well-being.\n\nBut is lying the right approach? Some might argue that the kids have the right to know their father's intentions and make their own choices, especially since they're 10 and 13 (so maybe a bit young). However, the author is acting in what she believes is their best interest, considering her past experiences with the ex. The ex's actions could be seen as manipulative, and the author's lie is a protective measure.\n\nThe friend says she's wrong, possibly because lying is generally frowned upon. But the context is important here. The author is protecting the kids from what she sees as a harmful situation. The ex's behavior (cheating, using money to gain favor) is questionable. So, the author's actions could be seen as justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of parental rights vs. protection, there's a balance. If the ex's actions are harmful, the author has a right to protect her children. However, if the ex's custody is legally established, there might be legal issues. But the question is about being an asshole, which is more about moral judgment.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intentions are protective, even if the method is deceptive. The ex's actions are manipulative. So the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
