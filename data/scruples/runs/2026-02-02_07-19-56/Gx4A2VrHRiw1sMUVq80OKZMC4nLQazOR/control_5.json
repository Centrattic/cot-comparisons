In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent lying to their ex about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with the ex's new wife, who was previously his mistress. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex cheated, and now the ex wants the kids to go to Japan with him and his new wife. The parent lies to the kids, telling them their dad is unavailable, to keep the Christmas tradition with their grandparents. The friend says the parent was wrong, but the parent thinks they're stopping manipulation.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether lying to protect the kids from a potentially harmful situation is justified. The parent's motivation is to protect the kids from what they see as their ex's manipulative behavior, possibly to prevent the new wife from influencing the kids. But is that a valid reason to lie?\n\nLegal aspects might come into play here. In many places, both parents have rights to visitation unless there's a court order restricting it. If the ex hasn't violated any legal agreements, the parent might be overstepping by lying about the kids' wishes. Also, the ex is offering a Christmas trip, which the parent is denying by deception. \n\nEmotionally, the parent is still hurt from the divorce and the cheating. They might be acting out of self-preservation and protecting the kids from what they perceive as the ex's bad parenting. However, the kids are 10 and 13, so they're old enough to have some say in their own schedules. Deceiving them could affect their trust in the parent if they find out later.\n\nThe ex is accused of being a bad father but has financial means to provide. The parent is preventing the kids from experiencing something they might enjoy, which could lead to resentment. On the other hand, if the ex's new wife is manipulative or harmful, the parent might be protecting the kids from negative influences.\n\nBut the parent's actions involve lying to both the kids and the ex. The ex was asked to check the kids' wishes, and the parent lied about the response. That could be seen as undermining the ex's parental rights unless there's a legal reason to do so. \n\nThe parent's friend says they're in the wrong, which suggests that honesty and transparency are important, even in difficult situations. Lying might prevent the kids from making their own decisions and could lead to future issues when the truth comes out.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intentions might be protective, the method of lying to manipulate the situation could be considered wrong. The parent is interfering with the ex's visitation rights without legal justification, which might not be the right approach. The kids deserve to know both parents' intentions and make informed choices, even if it's uncomfortable.\n"
