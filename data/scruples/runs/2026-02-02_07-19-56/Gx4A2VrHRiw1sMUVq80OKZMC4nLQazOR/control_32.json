In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The ex cheated with a coworker, they divorced, and now the ex wants to take the kids to Japan with his new wife. The author didn't tell the kids about the offer and told the ex that the kids declined, even though they might have been interested. The friend says the author shouldn't have done it, but the author thinks they stopped a manipulation attempt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex's actions were manipulative, trying to win the kids' affection through expensive gifts and trips, possibly to distance them from the author. The author is protecting the kids from what they see as a harmful situation. But is lying the right approach? \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, custody arrangements might dictate who can make decisions about the kids' schedules. If the ex has visitation rights, the author might have a legal obligation to consult or inform the ex. However, the author mentions the kids spend Christmas with grandparents, which might be part of the custody agreement. If the ex is only supposed to have the kids twice a year, maybe the author isn't legally required to agree to a different arrangement without the kids' input. \n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with past trauma and betrayal. The ex's actions were hurtful, and the author is trying to protect the kids from what they perceive as manipulation. The ex's new wife is described as \"barely legal,\" which adds another layer of concern about the suitability of the environment for the kids.\n\nEthically, lying could be seen as wrong because it's dishonest. However, the author's intention was protective. They might believe that the ex's trip is a way to buy the kids' love and alienate them from the author. The friend's criticism is about the dishonesty, but the author's perspective is that the ex's intentions are harmful.\n\nThe key points are the ex's manipulative behavior, the author's protective intent, and the potential legal custody issues. If the ex has the right to take the kids on trips during his visitation, the author's lie might be interfering with that. But if the ex's actions are harmful or against the kids' best interests, the author might be justified in protecting them.\n\nIn family law, the best interests of the child are paramount. If the ex is using the trip to manipulate the kids, the court might side with the parent protecting them. However, without legal evidence of harm, the author's lie could be seen as overstepping, especially if the ex has legal rights to take the kids.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are within the bounds of protecting the kids from a manipulative ex or if they're violating the ex's rights. Since the author isn't in the presence of the kids during the ex's visitation, maybe their interference isn't illegal, but morally, lying is still a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if the ex's actions are harmful, but if the ex's intentions are just to spend time with his kids, the author could be seen as undermining a parent's rights.\n"
