In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The ex-husband is cheating, they're divorced, and now he's taking his new wife (the mistress) and wants the kids to join him for Christmas in Japan. The author lies to her ex about the kids not wanting to go, so they don't have to spend time with his new wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' roles in co-parenting. After a divorce, both parents usually have some level of custody or visitation rights. If the ex has legal visitation, he's probably entitled to see the kids, but maybe there's a conflict over where they spend time. The author is keeping the kids away from the ex's new partner, which is understandable given the cheating history and the ex's behavior. But is lying the right approach here?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she wants to protect the kids from a situation that's potentially harmful, given the ex's infidelity and the introduction of the mistress. However, lying to the ex about the kids' wishes could be seen as manipulative or undermining his parental rights. Maybe the proper way would be to involve a mediator or legal process if there's a conflict, rather than lying. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex is using Christmas as a way to buy the kids' affection with expensive trips, which could be a form of manipulation. The author might feel justified in protecting the kids from this. But lying can have consequences, like eroding trust if the kids find out later. Also, the ex might have a right to know the kids' true wishes, even if he's not a perfect parent.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend says she shouldn't have lied. But the author believes she was protecting the kids. It's a tough balance between protecting children from a parent's flaws and respecting the parent's rights. The ex's actions (cheating, using money to buy affection) are problematic, but the mother's deception could also harm the kids' relationship with their father if they find out they were kept from something they wanted.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe the author should have communicated the concerns to the ex or sought legal advice. But given the emotional context\u2014divorce is messy, and the mother feels wronged\u2014it's possible she felt cornered. The key issue is whether the ends (protecting kids) justify the means (lying). \n\nIn family law, courts often prioritize the child's best interest, which includes maintaining relationships with both parents unless there's a danger. Since the ex isn't a danger but is flawed, the author's lie might be seen as overstepping. However, if the ex's actions are harmful (like involving the mistress), then protection makes sense. But the author's approach could be seen as violating the ex's parental rights without legal justification.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether lying to prevent the kids from seeing their father with his new wife is justified. If the author had legal grounds to restrict visitation due to a threat, maybe not, but since it's about personal discomfort and past issues, the lie might be considered the wrong approach. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for choosing deception over proper conflict resolution.\n"
