In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids' Christmas plans. So, the situation is that the ex wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas with his new wife, who was his mistress. The author thinks this is a bad idea because her ex isn't a good father and is trying to buy the kids' affection. She lies to her ex, telling him the kids don't want to go, when in reality, she didn't tell the kids about the offer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding custody and parental rights. In most places, once a divorce is finalized, both parents have rights to their children, unless there's a court order stating otherwise. If there's no such order, the ex has the right to request visitation. The author is essentially preventing that by lying about the kids' wishes. So legally, she might be in the wrong because she's interfering with the other parent's rights.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more nuanced. The author is motivated by protecting the kids from what she perceives as a harmful environment. She believes her ex isn't a good father and is using money to manipulate the kids. However, even if her intentions are good, lying could be seen as undermining the other parent's rights. The kids should have the opportunity to have a relationship with both parents unless there's a legal reason to restrict it. \n\nThe ex's actions (cheating and marrying the mistress) are clearly problematic, but the author's response is to withhold information. This could be seen as manipulation on her part as well. The kids have the right to know about their father's plans and make their own decisions, even if the author thinks they're being manipulated. Also, the kids' grandparents are involved in their Christmas plans, but the author is the one making the decision here without their input.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author shouldn't have done it might be valid because lying can erode trust and create more issues. The author's actions might prevent the ex from having contact he's entitled to, which could lead to legal issues if the ex challenges it. On the other hand, the author is trying to protect the kids from a father she finds manipulative and harmful. But in many cases, courts prioritize the child's relationship with both parents unless there's a clear danger. Since the author hasn't gone through legal channels to restrict contact, her actions could be considered overstepping.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author might be in the wrong. She's interfering with the ex's parental rights without legal justification, even if her intentions are protective. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
