In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The key points here are about the situation with the ex cheating, the divorce, and the current arrangement where the ex is trying to bond with the kids by taking them to Japan. The author didn't tell the kids about the offer and lied to the ex, saying they declined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the lie. The ex cheated and the author is still hurt. The ex now has a new wife, and he's trying to spend time with the kids, which the author sees as manipulative. The author might feel protective of her children, especially given the past trauma. Lying could be her way of protecting them from what she perceives as a harmful situation.\n\nBut then, there's the ethical aspect. Lying is generally frowned upon, but is it justified here? The author's friend said it was wrong, but the author disagrees. The question is whether the lie was for the children's best interest. If the kids wanted to go to Japan, the author might be denying them a wish. However, the author believes the trip is a ploy by the ex to manipulate the kids. \n\nAlso, the custody arrangement isn't clear. If the ex has legal rights to see the kids, maybe the author is overstepping by lying. But if the ex is using money to influence the kids, that's a different angle. The author's intent was to protect the kids from the ex's new wife and what she sees as manipulation. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the children. If the author is lying to protect them, but the kids might miss out on an experience, but on the other hand, exposing them to their father's new wife might cause emotional issues. The author's actions could be seen as a protective measure, but the method (lying) is questionable.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, parents are supposed to facilitate the other parent's time with the kids unless there's a danger. If there's no legal risk, the author's lie might be against the ex's rights. But if there's a history of abuse or manipulation, maybe the author is justified. However, the ex isn't the abuser here; the mistress is. The author's decision is based on her own feelings and protecting the kids from the mistress, but the ex might have a right to spend time with them.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the lie was necessary to protect the kids from harm. If the author believes the ex is using the trip to manipulate, but there's no concrete evidence, then the lie could be seen as overstepping. Alternatively, if the ex's actions are genuinely harmful, the lie might be justified. Since the situation is complex and the author's intent is to protect, it's a gray area. However, generally, lying to a co-parent about the children's wishes is ethically questionable, even if the motive is protective.\n"
