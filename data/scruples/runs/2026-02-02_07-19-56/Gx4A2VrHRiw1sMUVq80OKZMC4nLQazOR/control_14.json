In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids' Christmas plans. The situation is that the ex-husband wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas with his new wife, who was his mistress. The author is upset because of the cheating and the current situation, and she lied to the kids, telling them their dad was unavailable, instead of letting them decide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex cheated, which led to a divorce. Now he's trying to bond with the kids through expensive trips. The author feels protective and maybe resentful. She didn't want the kids to be with their dad and his wife, who was his mistress. She lied to the ex, making it seem like the kids refused the trip.\n\nIs the lie justified? The author's reasoning is to protect the kids from what she sees as manipulation. But parents have a right to see their children unless there's a legal restriction. If the ex has custody or visitation rights, maybe the author overstepped. However, if the custody is split and the author has primary custody, she might have the authority to make such decisions.\n\nAlso, the kids are 10 and 13. At that age, their preferences might be considered, but the parent still has the final say. The author's friend says she shouldn't have lied, which adds another perspective. The key here is whether the lie was harmful. If the kids were denied a meaningful relationship with their father, that's a problem. But if the father was using the trip to manipulate or if there's a history of abuse, then the lie could be protective.\n\nThe author's motivation is to protect the kids from their father's new wife, who was his mistress. There's a conflict of interest here. The ex is using money to influence the kids. The author might feel that the father isn't a good role model. However, as a parent, she should aim for the child's best interest. If there's no legal barrier, denying the visit could be seen as harmful.\n\nBut the author might argue that the father's actions post-divorce are unethical, and she's protecting the kids from a harmful environment. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Lying to the ex about the kids' wishes could be seen as manipulative. The ex was denied the opportunity to have the kids even if they wanted to go. The kids didn't get to make their own choice, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of legal rights, if the ex has agreed to the grandparents for Christmas and there's no court order, the author might have the right to make that decision. But if the ex is within his legal rights to propose a different visitation, the author's lie could interfere with that.\n\nEmotionally, the author is still hurt from the divorce. Her actions might be driven by anger and a desire for revenge rather than the kids' best interest. The friend's disapproval suggests that maybe the author crossed a line. The kids might be confused if they find out they were lied to, affecting their trust in the parent.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on protecting the kids from what she perceives as a harmful situation. However, lying to the ex about the kids' wishes could be seen as undermining the father's rights and potentially harming the children's relationship with him. The key is whether the author had valid reasons (like safety or well-being) that justify the lie. If there's no evidence of the new wife being harmful to the kids, the lie might be unnecessary. But if the author genuinely believes the environment is bad for the kids, it's a close call. Considering the situation, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but there's a strong argument for her being wrong (A) as well. However, given the context of the father's past actions and using money to buy affection, the author's actions could be seen as justified to protect the kids' emotional well-being. So, the answer is B.\n"
