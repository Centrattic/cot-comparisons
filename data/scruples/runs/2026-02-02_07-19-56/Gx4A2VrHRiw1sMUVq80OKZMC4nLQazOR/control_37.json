In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her ex are divorced, and he cheated on her with a coworker who's now his wife. They have two kids, 10 and 13. The ex wants the kids to go to Japan with him and his new wife for Christmas instead of their grandparents. The author didn't tell the kids about the offer, made up that they said no. Her friend says she shouldn't have done that, but she's seeking opinions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex's history of cheating, the current relationship with his new wife, the kids' usual holiday plans with grandparents, and the author's decision to lie to prevent the kids from going. The question is whether her lie was justified.\n\nI need to consider the ethics of lying in this context. On one hand, lying is generally frowned upon. But here, the motivation might matter. The author believes her ex is using the trip to buy the kids' affection, and she wants to protect them from the new stepmom. Also, the ex's actions during the divorce (cheating, now living with the mistress) might affect the kids emotionally. \n\nHowever, the kids are minors, and both parents have rights. The author's decision to not let them go could interfere with the ex's parenting time as per the divorce agreement. If the ex has legal visitation rights, withholding that without good cause could be problematic. But if the author's concerns are valid\u2014like the ex's behavior being harmful to the kids\u2014then maybe there's a justification.\n\nAnother angle: the author's personal feelings about the ex and the mistress might cloud her judgment. She mentions it's still raw, so her emotional state could influence her decision. But she's acting in the kids' best interest, as she sees it. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that lying is wrong, but the author sees it as protecting the kids. The ex wasn't invited, which might be his choice, but the author's lie affects the kids' relationship with their father. However, if the ex is not a good father, as stated, maybe the author is right to limit contact.\n\nI need to weigh the ethics of the lie against the potential harm. Lying to protect the kids from a manipulative or harmful situation might be understandable. But legally and ethically, parents typically need to communicate honestly about visitation unless there's a court order. The author's actions could lead to legal issues if the ex challenges it.\n\nIn summary, the author's intentions are to protect the kids from a harmful environment and prevent the ex from manipulating them. However, by lying, she's making decisions for the kids without their input and possibly violating the ex's rights. The answer might depend on the legal context and whether there's a valid reason to restrict visitation. Since the scenario doesn't mention legal orders, it's hard to say. But from an ethical standpoint, if the ex is a bad influence, the lie could be justified. But if the ex has the right to visitation, the author's actions might be problematic.\n"
