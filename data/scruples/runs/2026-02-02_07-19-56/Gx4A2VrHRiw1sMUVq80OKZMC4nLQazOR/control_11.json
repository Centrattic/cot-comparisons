In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent who is dealing with a recent divorce and ongoing issues with an ex-husband who cheated. The ex is now spending time with his new wife and wants the kids to join them for Christmas in Japan. The author decides to lie to the kids and tell them their dad isn't available because he's with another woman, preventing them from going.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation is clear: they don't want the kids to be with their dad and his new wife, possibly due to past trauma. But legally, both parents usually have rights to see their children unless there's a court order preventing it. The ex has custody rights, and the author's lie might be interfering with that.\n\nThe author's action was to deceive the kids. This could be harmful in the long run. If the kids find out they were lied to, it might damage their trust in the parent. Also, the ex might have a legitimate right to spend time with them, even if the author disagrees with his choices. The parent's role is to protect the kids' best interests, which includes allowing healthy relationships with both parents unless there's a danger.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that lying was wrong. The author's friend might be right because lying can set a bad precedent for the kids and could lead to more issues if discovered. The ex's behavior is questionable, but the parent's solution to lie might not be the healthiest approach. It's possible the author should have addressed the situation through legal means or communication rather than deception.\n\nHowever, the ex's actions (cheating, public humiliation) are significant factors. The author might feel justified in protecting the kids from a toxic environment. Still, the right way would be to involve the legal system or a mediator instead of lying. The author's emotional state is understandable, but the action taken might not be the most responsible.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are protective, the act of lying to prevent the ex from seeing the kids could be considered wrong. The correct approach would involve legal channels to protect the children without deceit. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
