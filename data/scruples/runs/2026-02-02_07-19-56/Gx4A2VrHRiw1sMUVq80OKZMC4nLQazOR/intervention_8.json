In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent lying to her ex about her kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. The ex is now married to his mistress and wants to take the kids, but the author doesn't want them to go because she thinks it's a manipulation tactic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, custody arrangements are decided when parents divorce. If the ex has visitation rights, maybe he can take the kids on trips, especially if it's during his scheduled time. The author decided not to tell the kids about the offer and lied instead. That could be an issue because children have a right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a court order preventing it. However, if the ex is a bad parent or there are valid concerns about the kids' well-being, that might justify some actions.\n\nThe ex is accused of being a bad father, buying the kids' love with money. The author might believe that protecting the kids from that is necessary. But lying to the ex about the kids' wishes could backfire if the ex finds out later. Trust is important in co-parenting, even after divorce. If the author lied, it might harm their ability to work together in the future.\n\nThe ex's new wife was a mistress during the marriage, which adds to the tension. The author feels humiliated and hurt, which is understandable. But the kids' best interests should come first. If the ex's behavior with the kids is harmful, then maybe the author is justified in protecting them. However, if there's no legal restriction, the ex might have the right to take the kids unless the court says otherwise.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author shouldn't have lied is another angle. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the other parent's rights. Even if the author has valid reasons, lying might not be the right approach. The author should probably address the situation through legal channels if there are concerns about the ex's parenting.\n\nIn summary, while the author has emotional and possibly justified reasons for her actions, lying to the ex about the kids' preferences could be seen as manipulative and might not be in the kids' best long-term interest. The correct approach would be to communicate openly and seek legal advice if necessary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for lying, even if her intentions were protective.\n"
