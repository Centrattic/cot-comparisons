In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for lying to their ex-husband about where the kids wanted to go for Christmas. The situation involves the ex wanting to take the kids to Japan with his new wife, who was his mistress during the marriage. The author didn't want the kids to spend time with him and his wife, so they lied about the kids' preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex cheated, leading to a divorce. The ex is using money to buy the kids' affection by taking them to Japan. The author felt the kids shouldn't be exposed to the mistress. The author lied about the kids' wishes to prevent this. The friend said the author was wrong, but the author disagrees.\n\nNow, the moral dilemma here is whether lying was justified. On one hand, the author is protecting the kids from what they perceive as a manipulative situation. On the other hand, lying might prevent the kids from having a choice or a positive experience with their father. The ex's actions could be seen as selfish, but the author's lie could be considered manipulative too.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have rights to custody and visitation unless there's a court order preventing contact. However, the situation is more about parental discretion. The author's intent was to shield the kids from the mistress, but maybe the kids have the right to see their father without interference.\n\nEmotionally, the author is still hurt from the divorce and the affair. The ex is using financial means to bond with the kids, which adds to the author's resentment. The author's lie might be an emotional response rather than a rational decision, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nHowever, the author's actions are also about protecting the kids from a potentially harmful environment. The ex's new wife being described as \"barely legal\" is a red flag, but that's not the author's place to judge. The author's role is to make decisions in the kids' best interest, which might involve protecting them from a parent's poor choices.\n\nBut the question is whether lying is justified. If the author believes that the ex's plans are harmful, maybe they should have tried other avenues like legal consultation rather than lying. Lying might undermine trust if the kids find out later. Also, the kids might miss out on a good experience with their father. The author's action could be seen as overstepping, even with good intentions.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the friend says the author is wrong. The friend's perspective might be that the author should let the kids decide or handle it through legal means instead of lying. The author, however, sees it as protecting the kids. It's a tough call because both sides have valid points, but lying to the ex about the kids' wishes could be considered manipulative. However, if the author truly believes it's in the kids' best interest, some might side with them.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because they manipulated the situation by not being truthful, even if their intentions were protective. But if the ex's actions were genuinely harmful, the author's lie could be justified. However, without a legal basis or involving the kids directly, the lie might be seen as crossing a line.\n"
