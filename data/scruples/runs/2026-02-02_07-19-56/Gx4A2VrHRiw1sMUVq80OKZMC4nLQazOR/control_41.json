In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a divorced parent who is trying to protect their kids from spending Christmas with their ex-husband and his new wife, who was previously the mistress. The ex wants to take the kids to Japan, but the author lies to the kids, saying the ex isn't available, and tells the ex that the kids refused the offer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex cheated, and now the kids only see him twice a year. The author feels the ex isn't a good father but has money. The ex's plan is to take the kids to Japan, which the kids might enjoy, but the author thinks it's a manipulative way to get the kids to bond with him and his new wife. The author's main motivation is to protect the kids from what they see as a manipulative and harmful situation. \n\nNow, the key question is whether lying was the right approach. The author didn't tell the kids about the offer and instead gave a false reason for the ex not being available. The ex was told that the kids refused, which isn't true. But the author's friend says they were wrong to lie. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have the right to spend time with their children unless there are court restrictions. If there's no legal order preventing the ex from taking the kids, the author might be interfering with the ex's custodial rights. However, if there's a history of abuse or manipulation, that could affect custody arrangements. But the author doesn't mention any legal issues here, just their personal feelings.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with past trauma and wants to protect the kids from what they perceive as their father's manipulation. However, lying could prevent the kids from making their own choices, especially since they are 10 and 13. At 13, the older child might be old enough to understand the situation and decide for themselves. By lying, the author is making decisions for the kids based on their own emotional pain and distrust.\n\nAnother angle is the ex's behavior. If the ex is using money to buy affection and the author believes it's manipulative, that's a valid concern. However, the ex's new wife was previously the mistress, which complicates things. The kids might be confused or hurt if they encounter her, especially if they know about the affair. The author might be trying to shield the kids from that situation.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of lying to the ex and to the kids could be seen as deceitful. While the author's intentions are to protect the kids, the method of lying might not be the best approach. Maybe a better way would be to have an honest conversation with the kids about the situation and let them decide, or to seek mediation or legal advice if there are concerns about the ex's behavior. \n\nThe author's friend says they shouldn't have lied, which makes sense because lying can erode trust and prevent the kids from forming their own opinions. However, the author's justification is based on protecting the kids from a harmful situation. It's a tough balance between protecting and controlling. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about the intent versus the action. The intent is to protect, but the action is deception. Depending on cultural or personal values, some might see the parent as justified, while others see it as overstepping. Legally, if there's no court order, the author might be infringing on the ex's rights by preventing contact. But emotionally, the parent's actions are driven by hurt and a desire to protect the children's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are understandable, the act of lying to manipulate the situation might make them the wrongdoer. The right approach would involve transparency and, if necessary, seeking legal or counseling support rather than deception. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they lied to manipulate the outcome, even with good intentions.\n"
