In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for lying to her ex-husband about her kids' Christmas plans to avoid them spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress.\n\nFirst, the context is a divorce where the ex cheated, and now he's trying to bond with the kids through expensive trips. The author feels the ex is using money to manipulate the kids, possibly to their detriment. She lied to protect the kids from what she sees as a harmful situation. \n\nThe key points here are the ex's actions (cheating, using money to gain favor) and the author's response (lying to protect the kids). The debate is between protecting children from potentially harmful influences versus being dishonest in parental decisions.\n\nLegally, both parents usually have rights, but emotionally, the ex's behavior might be seen as manipulative. The author's lie could be seen as a protective measure. However, lying to children about such matters might have its own issues, like trust. But considering the ex's history and the current situation, the author's intent was to shield the kids from a toxic environment. \n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author shouldn't have lied, but the author believes she was protecting the kids. The question is whether the lie was justified. In such cases, protecting children from a parent's manipulative behavior is often considered a valid concern, even if it involves some deception. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the lie was a necessary protection or an unnecessary deception. Given the ex's actions and the potential harm, the author's lie might be seen as justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
