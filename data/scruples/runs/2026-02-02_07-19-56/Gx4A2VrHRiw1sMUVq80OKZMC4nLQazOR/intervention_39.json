In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about her kids' Christmas plans. The situation involves a divorce where the ex cheated, and now he's trying to spend Christmas with the kids in Japan with his new wife, who is the mistress. The author lied to prevent the kids from going, thinking it was a manipulative ploy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, both parents have the right to custody and visitation unless a court has decided otherwise. If the ex has legitimate visitation rights, the mother might not have the legal authority to unilaterally decide where the kids spend Christmas. By lying, she might be interfering with his parental rights.\n\nEmotionally, the mother is dealing with past trauma from the cheating, which could influence her current decisions. She might feel protective of her children from the ex's negative influence. However, her actions could be seen as manipulative as well, using the kids' preferences as a cover.\n\nThe kids' best interests are a key factor. If the ex is a problematic parent but has legal rights, the mother's lie could prevent the kids from having a visitation they might want. On the other hand, exposing them to a potentially harmful environment with the stepmother might not be in their best interest. The mother's justification is that the ex is trying to buy affection with expensive gifts, which could be a valid concern.\n\nLegal implications: If the ex has court-ordered visitation, the mother could be in violation by lying about the kids' wishes. Ethically, deception is often frowned upon, even if the intent is protective. The mother's friend also criticized her, suggesting there's societal judgment against her actions.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The mother might argue that the ex's behavior is harmful, and she's protecting the kids. However, the ex's actions (cheating, current relationships) are part of the past; the current issue is about visitation. The mother's lie could be seen as a form of retaliation or ongoing conflict, which isn't healthy for the kids.\n\nIn summary, while the mother's motivations are understandable, her actions (lying) may infringe on her ex's parental rights and could have legal consequences. Ethically, deception, even with good intentions, can complicate co-parenting and the kids' well-being. So, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
