In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a divorce where the ex-husband is trying to spend Christmas with the kids in Japan, but the mother lies to the kids about it because she doesn't want them to be with his new wife, who was the mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex cheated, the mother feels it's a manipulation tactic because the ex is using money to win the kids over. The mother lies to the kids to prevent them from going. The friend says she's wrong, but the author disagrees.\n\nThe question is whether the mother's lie is justified. On one hand, she's protecting the kids from what she sees as a manipulative situation. On the other hand, lying to children about their parent's intentions can be harmful. Kids have a right to see both parents unless there's a danger. The mother's actions might be seen as overprotective or interfering with the ex's parental rights. However, the ex is now married to the mistress, so maybe the kids have a relationship with her now. \n\nBut the mother is the custodial parent, and in some cases, parents do make decisions based on their child's best interest. However, the kids are 10 and 13, so not too young. The mother didn't involve them in the decision, which could be problematic. But she claims it's to protect them from the ex's manipulation. \n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have rights unless there's a court order. But the mother's intent was to protect the kids from a situation she deems harmful. The ex's actions might be seen as using money to influence the kids, which could be a valid concern. However, the mother's solution was deception. \n\nEthically, lying to children about their parent's intentions could damage trust if the kids find out. But the mother might believe it's necessary to shield them from a harmful situation. The line is thin. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that the mother is wrong, but the user is asking for an opinion. Considering that the mother acted on her belief to protect the kids, even if the method was dishonest, there's a gray area. However, the act of lying might be seen as crossing a line, especially if the ex had a right to propose the visit. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) because while her intentions might be understandable, lying to the children about their parent's plans could be seen as manipulating the situation herself. The kids have a right to choose and to have a relationship with both parents. The mother's actions might prevent that, even if the ex's intentions are questionable. Unless there's a court order restricting the ex's rights, the mother's deception could be considered the wrong choice.\n"
