In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about them lying to their ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with him and his new wife, who was his mistress.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated, and the divorce is still raw. The ex is now trying to spend time with the kids by taking them to Japan, maybe to buy their affection with expensive trips. The author decides not to tell the kids about the offer and lies to the ex, saying the kids declined. The friend says it's wrong, but the author thinks they're protecting the kids from their dad's manipulative behavior.\n\nHmm. On one hand, lying is generally frowned upon. The ex has the right to know the kids' wishes, especially since custody arrangements might involve shared decision-making. The author is withholding information that the ex might be entitled to as part of their parenting rights. Also, the kids might have a right to know about their father's plans and make their own choices if they're old enough (they're 10 and 13, so maybe not fully, but still).\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that the ex is using the trip to manipulate the kids, possibly because the new wife is involved. The ex's actions in the past were deceitful, and the author is acting out of concern for the kids' well-being. The author might believe that protecting the kids from a potentially harmful situation is more important than honesty in this case.\n\nLegal rights vs. emotional well-being. If the parents have shared custody, the author might not have the sole authority to make such decisions. However, if the kids have been spending Christmas with the author's parents traditionally, maybe there's a precedent. The author's friend thinks lying is wrong, but the author thinks they're protecting the kids.\n\nIt's a tough call. The act of lying is there, but the intent is to protect. If the ex is indeed manipulating, the author's actions might be seen as justified. But legally or ethically, lying can have consequences. Maybe the right approach would have been to be honest and negotiate, rather than lie.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer depends on the context of custody and whether the author has the right to make such decisions. Since the author is choosing to protect the kids from what they see as their father's manipulation, but they're also withholding information that the ex might be entitled to, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the act of lying to prevent something they perceive as harmful might be seen as justified from the author's perspective. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the ex has parental rights, then the author might be in the wrong. But given the emotional context and possible manipulation, maybe not. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting the kids from a manipulative situation, even though the method is dishonest.\n"
