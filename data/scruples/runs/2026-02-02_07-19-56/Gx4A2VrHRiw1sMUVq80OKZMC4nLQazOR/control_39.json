In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his mistress, who is now his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The ex-husband cheated, the author is still hurt, and now he's trying to get the kids to Japan with him and his new wife. The author didn't invite the kids to his trip, so she lied to the kids about his absence and told him they declined. Her friend says she shouldn't have lied, but she disagrees.\n\nSo, the key points here: the ex is using money to buy the kids' affection, the author is protecting the kids from what she sees as manipulation. She's lying to prevent the kids from being influenced by their father's new wife. But is that justified?\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have the right to have their children, unless there are specific restrictions from a court. If the ex is following the legal custody agreement, then the author's lie might interfere with his parenting time. However, if there's a history of abuse or manipulation, courts might have restrictions. But the user didn't mention any court orders, just the author's feelings.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author's intent is to protect the kids from what she perceives as a harmful situation. However, lying to the kids and the ex could be seen as manipulative herself. The kids might be upset if they find out they were lied to, and the ex might feel his rights are being violated. But the author's trauma and the ex's infidelity could justify her actions from a protective standpoint.\n\nAlso, the ex's actions (taking the kids to Japan with the new wife) might be seen as an over-the-top gesture, possibly to create a bond. The author's lie prevents that, but is it right to do so through deception? If the author had legal grounds or was following a custody agreement, maybe it's okay. Without that, it's more about her personal feelings versus the ex's rights.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the story is subjective. The author's actions are driven by hurt and a desire to protect her kids, but lying is a form of dishonesty. The ex's behavior is unethical and potentially harmful, but the author's response is also a form of retaliation. The community on Reddit often sides with protecting children from harmful situations, but honesty is a value they also emphasize. So it's a tough call.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that lying was wrong. The author's reasoning is that the ex is manipulating the kids. Without more context on custody or legal agreements, it's hard to say definitively. But if the ex is within his legal rights, then the author's lie is interfering. However, if the ex's actions are harmful, perhaps the lie is justified. \n\nIn the end, it's a complex situation where both parties have flaws. The author's intentions are protective, but the method is deceptive. The ex's actions are manipulative. I think the answer would depend on whether there are legal restrictions, but since the user didn't mention any, the author might be in the wrong for lying. But others might see it as justified. The community might split, but the initial answer would probably be B (not in the wrong) because of the protective intent against a harmful ex, but some would argue A because of the lie.\n"
