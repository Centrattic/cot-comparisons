In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and her ex are divorced, and he cheated on her with a coworker, which is now his wife. The ex is using his money to try to bond with their kids, and he wants to take them to Japan for Christmas. The author, hurt and upset, lies to her ex by telling him the kids don't want to go, when in reality she's preventing them from visiting because of the new wife. The ex wasn't invited, and the author's friend said she shouldn't have done that. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: lying, protecting the kids from the stepmother (who was the mistress), the ex's behavior, and the kids' best interests. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex is using the trip to manipulate the kids, maybe to distance them from the author. The ex has money and is trying to buy the kids' affection, which is manipulative. The author is trying to prevent the kids from being exposed to this new wife, which might be harmful or confusing for them. But by lying, she's making a decision without the kids' input and without the ex's knowledge.\n\nNow, considering the children's best interests. If the kids wanted to go to Japan for Christmas, the author's lie might be denying them a wish. But if the ex is using this as a way to push his new wife into their lives without the author's consent, maybe it's protective. However, the author's actions are deceptive. The ex did ask about the kids' preferences, and she lied to him. That's the crux. \n\nIs lying ever justified? In co-parenting situations, transparency is usually important. The author's friend says she shouldn't have done it, implying that honesty is better, even if the ex is problematic. But if the ex is a bad parent and the stepmother is a negative influence, maybe the author's actions are protective. However, the author's decision to lie could be seen as undermining the ex's parenting rights, unless there's a court order or legal guidance against such visits.\n\nAlso, the children's ages are 10 and 13. At those ages, they might have strong opinions about where they want to spend Christmas. The author didn't consult them, which could be an issue. If the kids actually wanted to go but the author decided against it, that's a problem. But if the kids didn't want to go and the author is just confirming their feelings, maybe not. The author's account says the kids have always spent Christmas with grandparents, so maybe they're not eager to change. But the author didn't ask the kids, she just assumed.\n\nAnother angle: the ex is moving on with his life, which is his right. Denying him time with the kids because of past actions might not be fair. The author's resentment could be affecting the kids' relationship with their father, which is a concern. Even if the ex is a bad parent, the kids have a right to see both parents unless there's a legal reason to restrict. The author's lie might be interfering with that.\n\nBut the ex's new wife was his mistress, and now she's part of the family. The kids might be confused or hurt if they find out their father was unfaithful and now has a new partner. The author is trying to protect them from that. However, the stepmother is now his wife, so legally, she's part of the family. The author is preventing the kids from having a relationship with their new stepmother, which could have long-term effects.\n\nIs the author justified in protecting the kids from the stepmother? It's a gray area. If the stepmother is a positive influence, then the author is cutting off the kids from a potential bond. But if the stepmother's presence is harmful or if the father is using her to manipulate the kids, then maybe the author is protecting them.\n\nThe author's deception could be seen as a way to control the situation, but it's a lie to another parent. This could lead to more conflict and mistrust. In co-parenting, honesty is crucial. Even if the ex is at fault, the author's lie might not be the right approach.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are problematic because they involve lying to the ex, which can damage co-parenting dynamics. Even if her intentions are protective, the method of deception is questionable. The kids' wishes might have been considered, but since she didn't ask them, she's making a decision on their behalf. The ex's right to visitation, unless restricted by law, should be respected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the lie and overstepping.\n"
