In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a parent who divorced her ex-husband because he cheated on her with a coworker, who later became his wife. Now, the ex wants the kids (10 and 13 years old) to spend Christmas with him and his new wife in Japan, but the author lies to the kids, telling them their dad isn't available because he's with his mistress, and says they prefer to stay with their grandparents. The ex isn't happy but doesn't push further.\n\nThe author's friend says she's in the wrong for lying, but she disagrees. The question is whether she's the asshole here. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, both parents have the right to have custody or visitation with their children unless a court has decided otherwise. The author is denying the ex's request without the kids' knowledge or input, which might infringe on that right. But if there were custody arrangements, maybe that's different. The scenario doesn't mention court orders, so maybe it's joint custody or something else.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to protect her kids from what she perceives as manipulation by the ex. The ex is accused of using the trip to buy the kids' affection, and the author might feel that the kids shouldn't be exposed to his new wife, especially if she's a sensitive topic. However, lying to the kids about the situation could be seen as manipulative in itself. The author is presenting a false narrative to them, which might not be in the kids' best interest in the long run. It's possible the kids have a right to know the truth about their father's intentions, even if they're not old enough to understand the complexities of the situation.\n\nThe ex is described as not a good father but having money. The author's actions prevent the kids from spending time with their father, even if his motives are questionable. There's a balance between protecting children from a potentially harmful situation and ensuring they maintain a relationship with both parents. The author's decision might be based on her own emotional trauma, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong to prioritize the kids' well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's request could be part of his attempt to bond with the kids, which is a valid parental right. If the author is making decisions without considering the kids' wishes, especially since they're older (10 and 13), there's an argument that she's not involving them in the decision-making process. However, the kids have a history of spending Christmas with grandparents, so maybe the author is maintaining tradition. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Whether the ex's actions are manipulative or genuine 2) The author's right to make decisions about the kids' time 3) The impact of lying to the kids. \n\nIf the ex is using the trip to reconnect with the kids in a positive way, the author might be hindering that. But if the ex is manipulating the situation to favor his new wife or to undermine the author, her actions could be protective. However, lying to the kids could be seen as undermining their autonomy and trust. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a mix of protective instincts and manipulation. While her intentions might be good, the method of lying might be unethical. The answer could be A, but there's a strong case for B if the context of the ex's behavior justifies the lie. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering the ex's past and the potential manipulation, some might argue B. But others might say that lying is wrong regardless of the reason. It's a tough call.\n"
