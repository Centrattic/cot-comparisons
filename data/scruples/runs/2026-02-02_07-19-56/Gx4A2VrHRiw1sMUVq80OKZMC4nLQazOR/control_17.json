In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. The ex cheated, married the mistress, and the author doesn't want the kids to spend time with him and his new wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's main concern is protecting the kids from their father's new wife and the potential negative influence. The ex is using money to try to buy the kids' affection, and the author feels the kids have been loyal to the grandparents tradition. The author lied to prevent the kids from going, which she thinks is a manipulation by the ex.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is a legal parent, and the kids are minors. The author lying to the ex about the kids' wishes might interfere with his parental rights. Even if the ex is a problematic parent, the mother's decision to lie could be seen as undermining the father's legal entitlements. However, the father's actions (cheating, manipulating with money) might justify the mother's protective stance for the kids' emotional well-being.\n\nThe key points here are the legal aspects of parental rights versus the mother's duty to protect her children from a harmful situation. In many jurisdictions, both parents have rights to custody and visitation unless there's a court order restricting it. If there's no such order, the mother's lie could be seen as unethical, even if her intentions are good. However, if the father's actions are harmful and there's a history of abuse or manipulation, the mother might have a stronger case for protecting the kids.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friend says she shouldn't have lied, which adds a social perspective. But the mother's justification is based on the kids' best interests. It's a tricky balance between legal rights and moral obligations. Since the mother isn't in court and the father isn't contesting custody, her lie might be considered unethical but not legally wrong. However, the question is about being an \"asshole,\" which is more about social morality rather than legal.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the mother not being in the wrong because her intention was to protect the kids from a harmful situation, even if it involved lying. But there's also an argument that she should respect the father's rights. However, given the father's behavior and the kids' tradition, her actions could be seen as justified.\n"
