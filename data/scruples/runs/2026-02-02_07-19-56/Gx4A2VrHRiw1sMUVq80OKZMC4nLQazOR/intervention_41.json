In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have shared custody or visitation rights after divorce. The ex-husband is using his money and the kids' interests (like Japanese culture) to lure them away. The mother is withholding the truth to block this. \n\nLegally, the mother might need to let the kids choose if that's part of their custody agreement. But if there's no court order specifying, maybe it's more about the kids' preferences. However, the mother is lying, which is the key point here. \n\nEthically, the mother's actions are driven by protecting the kids from what she sees as manipulation and a bad influence (the mistress). On the other hand, the ex is trying to build a relationship with his kids, which is a parent's right. The mother's lie could prevent the kids from seeing their father, which might be harmful in the long run.\n\nThe friend's perspective was that the author is wrong, suggesting that honesty is better. But the mother's reasoning is about protecting the kids from a harmful situation. However, lying might not be the best approach, even if the intent is good. Maybe there's a better way, like involving a mediator or following legal channels if there's a custody issue. \n\nThe mother could be seen as acting out of anger and protecting the kids, but the lie could backfire if the kids find out later. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The key is whether the lie was justified to protect the kids' well-being versus the right to parent. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be ethically questionable because the lie could harm the kids' relationship with their father, even if the intention was to protect them. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but it's nuanced.\n"
