In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and her ex are divorced. He cheated on her with a coworker, who's now his wife. The kids are 10 and 13, and they usually spend Christmas with the author's parents. The ex wants them to go to Japan with him and his new wife, but the author lies to the kids and tells them their dad isn't around because he's with his mistress, making up that the kids said no.\n\nThe ex is using money to buy the kids' affection, and the author is trying to protect the kids from what she sees as manipulation. The friend says she shouldn't have lied, but the author disagrees.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, lying to the kids could be seen as deceptive. The ex has legal rights as a parent, and the kids might have a right to know about the opportunity. Also, the author is making decisions for the kids without their input, which could affect their relationship with the father. The ex might feel it's important for the kids to spend time with him, even if he's not a great parent. The author's actions could be seen as interfering with the ex's parenting rights.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex cheated and then married the mistress, which is a major betrayal. The author might believe that exposing the kids to this new \"wife\" is harmful, especially if the ex is using money to win their favor. The author is protecting the kids from what she sees as emotional manipulation. She's also acting in what she believes is the kids' best interest, even if it's through deception.\n\nBut wait, the kids are 10 and 13. Should they have a say? The author didn't let them decide, which could be problematic. However, the ex's actions might be harmful, and the author is trying to shield them. The key here is whether the lie was justified to protect the kids from a manipulative situation.\n\nAnother angle: The author's friend says she shouldn't have lied. The author's actions might undermine the ex's authority or create mistrust between the kids and their father. But if the ex is being manipulative, maybe the author is protecting the kids from that influence.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could have addressed the situation without lying. For example, discussing the situation with the kids and explaining their father's behavior without lying. Or working with the ex to find a more neutral arrangement. But the author chose to lie, which could have long-term effects on the kids' trust in her.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, unless there are court orders specifying custody or visitation, the ex might have a right to propose visitation, and the author's interference could be legally questionable. However, the question is more about moral wrongdoing rather than legal.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author acted out of a desire to protect the kids from what she perceives as harmful manipulation. However, lying to achieve that end might be seen as ethically wrong because it deceives the kids and could harm their relationship with their father. On the other hand, protecting the kids from a potentially harmful situation might justify the lie.\n\nBut the answer depends on the perspective. If the ex is indeed manipulative and using money to gain favor, the author's actions might be seen as justified. However, if the ex's intent is genuine and the author's lie prevents the kids from experiencing a positive trip, then she might be in the wrong.\n\nSince the author's account is her perspective, and we don't have the ex's side, it's hard to know. But based on the information given, the author's actions are a reaction to past betrayal and ongoing conflict. The lie is a way to protect the kids from a situation she views as harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her actions stem from a desire to protect the children from a manipulative and harmful situation, despite the ethical dilemma of lying.\n"
