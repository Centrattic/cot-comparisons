In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The context is that the ex cheated, the author found out through humiliation, and the ex now wants to take the kids to Japan with his new wife, who was the mistress. The author lied to the kids to prevent them from going, claiming the ex isn't a good father and is trying to buy their love with money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentions they're divorced, but the custody arrangement isn't detailed. If the ex has visitation rights, then the author might be interfering with a legal right. However, if the ex's actions are harmful, maybe it's justified. But since the author is lying about the kids' preferences, that's a red flag legally, as the kids' actual wishes might be important in custody decisions.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author is protecting the kids from what they see as manipulation and harm. The ex is seen as a bad father, and the new wife's age is implied to be an issue (\"barely legal\"), which adds to the author's concern. But lying to the kids about their father's intentions could be seen as undermining their relationship with the father, especially if the ex genuinely wants to spend time with them. The kids might feel deceived later.\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author shouldn't have lied. The author's justification is protecting the kids from a harmful situation. However, the author's anger and past trauma might be influencing their judgment. The ex's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could have legal and emotional consequences.\n\nIf the ex has legal visitation rights, the author's actions could be against those terms. Even if not, lying about the kids' wishes might not be the best approach. The author might need to address this through legal channels rather than deception. The kids might also feel conflicted if they learn the truth later.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are protective, the method of lying could be unethical and potentially illegal if it violates custody agreements. The answer might depend on the legal rights in their jurisdiction, but since the user is asking for a general opinion, the lie itself is a problem regardless of the motive. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
