In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for lying to their ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, married the mistress, now wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas. The mother lies to the ex, saying the kids don't want to go, to prevent them from spending time with him and his new wife. The kids are 10 and 13, so they might have their own preferences, but the mother made the decision without their input.\n\nThe user's friend thinks she's in the wrong. The user is unsure. The question is whether the mother's actions are justified or not.\n\nArguments for her being in the wrong (A): She lied to her ex. She didn't consult her kids. Her ex had visitation rights, and she's manipulating the situation. Even if the ex is a bad father, withholding information could be harmful. The kids might miss out on a positive experience if the father is trying to reconnect.\n\nArguments for her not being in the wrong (B): The ex cheated and is now with the mistress. The mother is protecting the kids from a manipulative situation. The ex's plans seem more about showing off money than genuine family time. The kids have been with the grandparents for Christmas, so maybe the mother is following their routine.\n\nConsiderations: Legal aspects\u2014visitation rights. Emotional impact on the kids. The mother's motivation (protection vs. control). The father's role as a father. Did the mother act in the kids' best interest? If the father is a bad parent, maybe the mother is right to prevent the visit. But if the father is trying to reconnect, maybe the lie is harmful.\n\nThe line between protection and control is thin. If the mother made the decision without the kids' input, it might be controlling. However, given the father's history, she might believe it's necessary for the kids' well-being.\n\nIn the end, the answer depends on the balance between the mother's intentions and the potential harm of her actions. If she acted out of genuine concern and the kids are too young to make the decision, maybe it's not her fault. But lying and not consulting the kids could be seen as wrong.\n"
