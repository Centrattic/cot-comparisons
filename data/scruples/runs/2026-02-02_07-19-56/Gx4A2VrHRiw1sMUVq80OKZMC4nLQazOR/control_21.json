In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent lying to their ex about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with the ex's new wife, who's also his mistress. \n\nFirst, the ex cheated with a coworker, and they divorced. Now the ex is trying to spend Christmas with the kids in Japan with his new wife, and the author doesn't want the kids to go. The author lied to the kids and told the ex that they declined the Japan trip.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex is using the kids to make up for his cheating and that he's trying to buy their affection with expensive gifts. The author feels it's manipulative and doesn't want the kids to be part of that. But the friend says the author shouldn't have lied.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the kids from what they see as a manipulative situation. The ex's actions might be questionable, especially if he's using money to influence the kids. The author might believe that the kids are too young to handle the emotional complexity of seeing their dad with his new wife, especially since he cheated. Also, the author might feel justified in lying to protect the kids' well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, lying to the kids could be seen as unethical. The kids have the right to know their father's intentions and make their own decisions, even if they're minors. The author is making decisions for the kids based on their own feelings, which might not be in the kids' best interest. Also, the ex has a right to spend time with his children, unless there are legal restrictions due to the divorce. If there's no legal custody issue, the author might be overstepping by not allowing the kids to choose or by lying about their wishes.\n\nAnother angle is the author's emotional state. They mention that the divorce is still raw. Their feelings of betrayal and resentment might be influencing their decisions, making the lie about the kids' preferences. The ex's actions could be problematic, but the author's method of handling it\u2014deception\u2014might not be the best approach. Transparency and communication, even if difficult, are usually better for the kids' understanding and emotional health.\n\nThe ex might be using the trip to bond with the kids, which is a legitimate parental desire. If the author is blocking that without the kids' input, it's possible they're undermining the kids' relationship with their father. However, if the ex is indeed manipulative or harmful, preventing the kids from being in a harmful environment is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intent was protective, but the method involved deception. Whether that's wrong depends on the context. If there's no legal issue and the ex is allowed to have visitation, lying to the kids about their preferences could be seen as manipulative from the author's side. The kids deserve honesty, even if the truth is complicated. The author might be projecting their own anger and pain onto the situation, making the lie a way to control the outcome without involving the kids' autonomy.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they lied to the kids and potentially interfered with their relationship with the father, unless there's a compelling reason (like legal restrictions or safety) that the author didn't mention. Since the scenario doesn't state that the ex is unfit legally, the author's actions might be ethically questionable despite their intentions.\n"
