In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by lying to her ex about the kids' Christmas plans. The ex cheated, and now has a new wife. He wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, which the author thinks is to bond with them and his new wife. She didn't tell the kids about the offer and lied to her ex, saying they declined. Her friend said she was wrong, but she disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex is not a good father but has money, and is using it to try to gain the kids' favor. The author's main concern is protecting the kids from being with the mistress who used to work for him and now he's with her. The author might feel justified in lying to protect the kids from what she sees as manipulation.\n\nBut is lying the right approach? The ex has a legal right to see his kids. The author is the parent, so she's making decisions on their behalf. However, if the ex is unfit or there's a history of abuse or neglect, maybe it's justifiable. But the scenario says the kids spend time with him twice a year, which might be part of a custody agreement. The author's lie could interfere with his parenting time, unless there's a court order preventing it.\n\nThe author's friend says she's wrong, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the ex cheated, the new wife was involved with him during the marriage, and the author is protecting the kids from what she sees as a manipulative situation. The ex's actions are questionable, but the author's lie could be seen as preventing the kids from a better experience (Japan trip) unless there's a valid reason to block it.\n\nLegal perspective: If the ex has legal custody, the author can't just block without a reason. But if the ex is violating custody terms or there's a history of abuse, then it's different. The author hasn't mentioned any court orders or legal actions regarding the children. Since the ex is the one arranging the trip and the author isn't, but the kids are with her more, she might have more say in their preferences. But lying about their wishes could be problematic if it's discovered later.\n\nEmotional perspective: The author is hurt and wants to protect the kids. However, lying could have consequences. If the kids find out, they might feel manipulated. Also, the ex might see this as a betrayal, which could escalate tensions. The author's actions might be seen as justified by some, but others might think she should have handled it through legal means or communication instead of lying.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, lying can be wrong, but context matters. If the ex is genuinely using money to manipulate the kids, the author's lie might be a protective measure. However, it's possible the ex isn't trying to manipulate, and the trip is just a nice gesture. The author's negative perception might be clouding her judgment.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the lie was necessary to protect the kids from harm. If there's no legal or immediate danger, maybe the author overstepped. But given the history of infidelity and the ex's current relationship with the mistress, the author's intent to shield the kids from what she sees as a harmful situation could be seen as reasonable. However, the method (lying) might not be the best approach. The correct answer depends on whether the author's actions are considered justified under the circumstances. Given the emotional context and the ex's behavior, many might side with the author, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
