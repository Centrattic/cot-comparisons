In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids' Christmas plans. The situation involves a divorce where the ex cheated with a coworker, now married to her, and the ex is trying to buy the kids' affection with a trip to Japan. The author lied to prevent the kids from going, claiming they wanted to stay with grandparents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The ex's actions are questionable\u2014cheating, now living with the mistress, and using money to influence the kids. The author felt that the trip was a manipulative ploy to bond with the kids in her absence. Her solution was to lie about the kids' preferences.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, both parents have rights to visitation unless restricted by a court. The author's lie could interfere with those rights. However, if there's a history of manipulation or harm, courts might have exceptions. But the author isn't going through legal channels here; she's acting unilaterally.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly hurt and distrustful. The ex's behavior has caused her significant pain, and she's trying to protect the kids from what she sees as a manipulative scenario. But by lying, she's making decisions for the kids without consulting them, which could affect their relationship with the father if they find out the truth later.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the ends justify the means. The author believes she's protecting the kids from a harmful situation, but the lie could backfire. The ex might take legal action, or the kids might feel lied to when they discover the truth. The friend's opinion is that the author is wrong, suggesting that honesty is important even in difficult circumstances.\n\nHowever, the ex's actions (cheating, using money to influence) are problematic. The author might feel justified in protecting her children from a parent who isn't emotionally present or trustworthy. But legally and ethically, lying to prevent custody issues is risky. There's a balance between protecting children and respecting the other parent's rights.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are understandable, her actions could be seen as crossing a line by interfering with the ex's parental rights without legal grounds. The lie might have short-term benefits but could lead to long-term complications. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because she manipulated the situation without proper justification or legal backing, even if her motives were protective.\n"
