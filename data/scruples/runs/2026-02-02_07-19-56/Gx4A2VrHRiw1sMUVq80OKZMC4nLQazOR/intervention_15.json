In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from going with him and his new wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are divorced, and the ex cheated with someone who became his new wife. The author feels hurt and doesn't want the kids to spend time with him and his new wife. The ex wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, but the author lies about the kids' wishes, saying they don't want to go. \n\nThe key points here are the children's best interests. The author's reasoning is that the ex is using material things to win the kids' affection, and she doesn't want them to be exposed to a new stepmother. However, the author is making a decision on behalf of the kids without their input. Legally, in many places, both parents usually have a say in custody and visitation, especially if the children are old enough to express their preferences. \n\nThe author's friend says she's in the wrong, which makes me think about the ethics of lying. Lying can be harmful even if the intent is good. The author might be protecting the kids from what she sees as a bad situation, but she's also denying them the chance to decide for themselves. The kids are 10 and 13, which is a bit young for major decisions, but maybe old enough to have some input.\n\nAlso, the ex's actions (cheating, moving on with the mistress) are questionable, but the author's response is to lie to prevent the visit. There's a conflict between protecting the kids and respecting their autonomy. The law might require cooperation between parents, unless there's a court order preventing contact. If the author is blocking a parent from seeing the kids without legal justification, that could be an issue.\n\nBut the author doesn't mention any legal restrictions. She's making a decision based on her own feelings. There's a potential bias here\u2014her own hurt feelings might be influencing her, not the kids' actual needs. If the kids wanted to go to Japan, denying them without their knowledge could be harmful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. She's acting out of love and protection, but lying to the kids and their father could have negative consequences. Legally, if the ex has visitation rights, she might be infringing on them. Ethically, it's about whether her actions are in the kids' best interests versus her own. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether there's a legal right for the ex to have visitation and whether the author's decision is in the kids' best interest. If the ex is not a fit parent, maybe the author's right to protect the kids. But since she's lying and not consulting the kids, it's a gray area. However, given the information, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if the kids would have wanted to go. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
