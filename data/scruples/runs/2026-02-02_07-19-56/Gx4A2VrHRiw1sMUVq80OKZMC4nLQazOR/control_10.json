In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the ex cheated, married the mistress, and the author is still hurt. The ex wants to take the kids on an expensive trip, but the author lies to prevent that. She says the kids don't want to go. The friend says she's wrong, but she's seeking opinions.\n\nHmm. Legal custody? If the ex has visitation rights, maybe the author is interfering with that. But if they have joint custody and the author has primary custody, she might have some say. But the ex is offering a trip, not taking the kids away. So maybe she's blocking a legitimate visitation. But the ex's intentions might be manipulative, using money to win the kids over. The author is protecting the kids from a manipulative parent. \n\nBut lying could backfire if the kids later want to visit. Also, if there's a custody agreement, she might not have the right to block it. But the ex's actions were unethical. The author's lie was to protect the kids from a harmful situation. \n\nIt's a tough call. On one hand, lying isn't great, but on the other, protecting kids from a manipulative parent. The ex is using money to buy affection, and the author is preventing that. Maybe the author isn't the asshole here. But maybe the ex is, but the question is whether the author is wrong. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions were to protect the kids. Even though it's a lie, the intent was good. So answer B.\n"
