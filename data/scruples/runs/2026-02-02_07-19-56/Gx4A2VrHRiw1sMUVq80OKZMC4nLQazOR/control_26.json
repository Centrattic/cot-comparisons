In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is the asshole (AITA). The situation involves lying to an ex-husband about kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from going with him and his new wife, who is his former mistress. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The ex cheated, the divorce is still raw, and now the ex wants the kids to spend Christmas in Japan with him and his new wife. The author lied to the kids' father about their preferences to keep them with grandparents instead. \n\nThe author's friend says they shouldn't have lied, but the author thinks they were protecting the kids from the ex's manipulative intentions. The ex is described as not a good father but has money and is trying to buy affection. The kids are 10 and 13, so they might be old enough to have an opinion, but the author didn't consult them.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Lying is generally frowned upon, but the intent matters. The author's intent was to protect the kids from what they see as their father's manipulative behavior. However, lying to a co-parent can be problematic because it undermines trust and communication, which are crucial for co-parenting. Even in a contentious divorce, both parents should ideally be honest to avoid further conflict and ensure the kids' best interests are met.\n\nThe ex's actions might be questionable (cheating, trying to spend time with the kids in a lavish way), but the author's response was to withhold information and lie. This could backfire if the ex finds out the truth or if the kids feel deceived. Also, the kids might want to have a relationship with their father, even if the author disapproves of his new partner. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex's motivation to win the kids over through expensive trips could be seen as manipulative. The author might feel justified in protecting the kids from potential emotional harm. However, the right approach might have been to communicate openly, perhaps setting boundaries rather than lying.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. While the intent is protective, the method (lying) could be seen as unethical. The answer depends on balancing the intent with the action. If the author's actions prevent the kids from seeing their father, that's a parenting issue. If the ex's behavior is genuinely harmful, then the author might be justified. But since the ex is their father, cutting off contact without cause could be harmful too. \n\nIn many legal and co-parenting contexts, lying to a co-parent is not advisable. The appropriate approach would be to address the concerns through legal channels if necessary, rather than deception. Therefore, the author's lie could be considered wrong because it breaches trust and might prevent the kids from a relationship with their father, which is generally important unless there's a clear danger. There's no mention of legal restrictions here, so the assumption is that both parents have shared custody rights. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because lying to a co-parent, even with bad intentions, disrupts the co-parenting relationship and may harm the children's ability to have a relationship with their father. The better approach would have been honest communication or addressing the concerns through proper channels.\n"
