In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex about the kids not wanting to go to Japan for Christmas. The ex is the kids' father, now married to his mistress, and the author wants to prevent the kids from spending time with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, both parents have the right to custody arrangements unless a court decides otherwise. If the divorce decree doesn't specify otherwise, the ex might have the legal right to have the kids with him during holidays. The author's lie could interfere with that legal right. But maybe there's a custody arrangement that allows the mother to make decisions, but the user didn't mention that. Without knowing the specific custody terms, it's hard to say, but assuming there's no restriction, the mother might be overstepping.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The mother's intention is to protect the kids from what she sees as manipulation. She believes the ex is using the trip to buy the kids' affection. However, the kids are 10 and 13, so they might be old enough to have some say in their arrangements. By not telling them about the offer, the mother is making decisions for them, which could be seen as undermining their autonomy.\n\nAlso, the mother's actions involved lying to the ex. Deception here might have consequences. If the ex finds out the truth, it could lead to conflict or legal action. The mother's friend said she shouldn't have done it, which adds a layer of social disapproval.\n\nThe emotional aspect: the mother is dealing with past trauma from the cheating and divorce. Her actions stem from a place of protecting the kids, which is understandable. But is lying the right way to handle it? There might be other avenues, like discussing the situation with the ex, involving a mediator, or consulting a lawyer if there are concerns about the ex's parenting.\n\nIn terms of the kids' well-being, the mother is trying to shield them from a potentially harmful relationship with their father. However, cutting off contact entirely, even if it's a holiday trip, might not be in their best interest unless there's a safety concern. The ex is described as not a good father, but he's providing a festive experience. The kids might miss out on a special trip, but maybe the mother's actions are preventing a negative experience.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's ex might be trying to rebuild a relationship with the kids, which is important for their emotional development. The mother's lie could be seen as sabotaging that, even if her intentions are good. The ex might also feel that the mother is still controlling aspects of the kids' lives, which could be part of the ongoing tension from the divorce.\n\nIn summary, while the mother's intentions are protective, the method she used\u2014lying\u2014might not be the right approach. There could be better ways to address her concerns without engaging in deceit, which can have its own set of problems. Legally, unless there's a court order preventing the ex from having the kids, her actions could be seen as interfering with custody rights. Ethically, it's a gray area but leaning towards the mother being in the wrong because of the deception and potential legal implications.\n"
