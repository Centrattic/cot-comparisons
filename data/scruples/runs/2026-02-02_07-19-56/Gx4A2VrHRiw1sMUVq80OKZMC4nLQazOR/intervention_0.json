In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their ex about the kids' Christmas plans. The situation is that the ex is taking the kids to Japan with his new wife, the mistress, and the author didn't want the kids to go. They lied to the kids and told their ex that the kids said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights and responsibilities. Both parents usually have a say in their children's upbringing, especially after divorce. The author's ex had the kids twice a year, but he's trying to spend more time with them through this trip. The author is preventing that by lying. Is that justified?\n\nThe ex's behavior is questionable\u2014cheating, then marrying the mistress, and now trying to buy the kids' affection with a fancy trip. The author feels hurt and doesn't want the kids to be influenced by the ex or the stepmom. But are the kids old enough to make their own decisions? The kids are 10 and 13, so not yet teenagers but getting there. The author didn't even let the kids know the option was there, which might be a problem. \n\nThe author's friend says they shouldn't have lied. Is the author manipulating the situation for their own emotional reasons? The author is acting out of hurt and possibly a desire to protect the kids from the ex's manipulative behavior. But maybe the right thing would be to let the kids decide, given their age. However, the ex's situation is also problematic. The trip might not be in the kids' best interest if it's a way to bond with the stepmom who is part of the reason for the divorce.\n\nLegal aspects could matter too. In many places, both parents have rights to spend time with their children unless there's a court order saying otherwise. The author might be violating that by not allowing the ex to have the kids, even if they are lying about the kids' preferences. But if the court is involved, maybe there are restrictions. The scenario doesn't mention legal proceedings, though.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid\u2014they\u2019re hurt and trying to protect the kids. But lying to prevent the ex from seeing the kids, even if the ex's motives are questionable, might be crossing a line. The author is making a decision for the kids without their input, which could harm the kids' feelings in the long run. If the kids wanted to go to Japan, they might feel betrayed later if they find out they were lied to.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's actions are manipulative. The author might be protecting the kids from a potentially harmful environment. However, unless there's a legal reason to restrict visitation, the author's lie could be seen as interfering with the ex's parental rights. The answer might depend on local laws, but generally, both parents have rights post-divorce. The author's actions could be considered in the wrong because they're denying the ex's visitation without a legitimate reason beyond their personal feelings.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are to protect the kids, the means (lying) could be unethical or even illegal. The correct approach might be to involve a mediator or court if there's a legitimate concern about the ex's parenting. The author's lie could be seen as inconsiderate and manipulative, especially since it's about the kids' preferences. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
