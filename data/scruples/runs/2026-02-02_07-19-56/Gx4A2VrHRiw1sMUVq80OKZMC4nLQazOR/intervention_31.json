In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about her kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with him and his new wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex cheated, and now the kids only see him twice a year. The ex wants to take them to Japan, but the author lies and says the kids don't want to go. Her friend says she's in the wrong, but she's unsure.\n\nSo, the key points here are custody and visitation rights. In many places, after a divorce, both parents have rights to their children unless there's a court order restricting visitation. If the ex is allowed by the court to have custody during certain times, the author might not have the legal right to deny it. Even if she has joint custody, she might need to communicate openly or follow court orders. \n\nThe author is lying to prevent the visit, which could be seen as interfering with the ex's parenting time. Even if there are personal feelings involved, like the cheating and the new wife, the law typically prioritizes the child's relationship with both parents. However, if there are legitimate safety concerns or evidence of harm, that's different. The story mentions the ex isn't a good father but has money, so maybe there are other issues. But the author didn't provide legal context. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that lying is wrong. The author might believe she's protecting the kids from their father's behavior. But from a legal standpoint, unless there's a valid reason to restrict visitation (like endangerment), withholding information could be problematic. The court might have specific guidelines, and the ex could take legal action if he's not happy with being lied to. \n\nAlso, the kids' wishes are important but depend on their age and maturity. The author is making decisions for them without their input. The kids are 10 and 13, so maybe they could voice their preference. However, the author is acting in their best interest based on her perspective, but that might not align with legal standards.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be seen as ethically questionable because she's interfering with the ex's visitation rights. Unless there's a legal justification, lying to prevent the visit might be considered wrong. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
