In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The question is about lying to the ex-husband regarding the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was the mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The ex cheated with a coworker who worked under him and was known to the author when they were married. The divorce was three years ago, but the situation is still raw. The ex now only sees the kids twice a year, which could mean limited visitation rights. The author claims he's not a good father but has money and is trying to buy the kids' affection by offering a luxurious trip to Japan. The author lied to the ex, saying the kids don't want to go, even though the real reason was to avoid the ex's new wife.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intent was to protect the kids from the ex's new wife (mistress) by deception, and the ex's actions might be seen as manipulative. The author's friend says they shouldn't have lied, but the author disagrees.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider legal aspects, ethical considerations, and the best interests of the children. Legally, the ex might have visitation rights, and the author might not have the authority to unilaterally decide where the kids go unless there's a court order. Even if the ex is a bad father, lying to restrict visitation could lead to legal consequences. However, if there's no court order, maybe the author is using their discretion.\n\nEthically, lying to prevent something the author finds harmful (the kids being around the stepmother) could be seen as a protective measure. But deception can have its own issues. The author's reasoning is that the ex is using the trip as a ploy to win the kids over through expensive trips, which the author wants to avoid. The author's friend suggests the author is in the wrong for lying, but the author feels justified.\n\nI need to weigh the intent against the actions. The author's intent was to protect the kids from what they perceive as a manipulative situation. However, lying to the ex about the kids' wishes might undermine the kids' autonomy. If the kids were old enough to have their own preferences, the author should ideally respect that. But in this case, the kids are 10 and 13, so they might not have the full capacity to discern the ex's motives. The author is acting in the kids' best interest, but is that a valid reason to lie?\n\nAlso, the mention of the ex's new wife being \"barely legal\" might be a red herring or a way to justify the lie. If that's true, there could be legal concerns about the relationship, but the main issue here is the Christmas visitation. The author might be trying to prevent the kids from being exposed to a potentially inappropriate relationship, but that doesn't necessarily mean lying is the right approach.\n\nIn family law, unless there's a court-ordered restriction on visitation, both parents typically have the right to spend time with their children. The mother might be overstepping by lying, especially if the ex was genuinely trying to reconnect with the kids through a vacation they enjoy. The mother's actions could be seen as undermining the ex's parenting rights, even if he's a flawed parent.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they used deception to deny the ex's visitation attempt, which could be considered a right the ex has. However, the context of the ex's behavior (cheating, possibly manipulating the kids) might make the author's lie a form of self-protection and protection of the kids from a harmful influence. But lying is generally frowned upon, even in tough situations. The ethical dilemma is whether the harm of lying outweighs the potential harm of the kids spending time with the ex and his wife. \n\nI think the answer here depends on whether there's a legal framework in place. If the ex has the right to visitation, then the mother is in the wrong for lying. But if the ex's visitation was conditional or the mother has the authority to decide based on the kids' well-being, then maybe not. Since the user didn't mention any court orders, it's likely that the ex's visitation is a right he still has. Therefore, the mother's lie could be unethical and potentially illegal if it's interfering with legitimate visitation rights. The better approach would have been to be honest and express concerns to the court or a mediator if needed.\n"
