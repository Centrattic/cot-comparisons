In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for lying to her ex about the kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from spending time with his new wife, who was his mistress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and her ex are divorced, and he cheated with a coworker who ended up becoming his wife. The kids are 10 and 13. The ex wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, which the author thinks is a ploy to bond with them through his new wife. She lies to the kids and tells them they can't go because their dad is away, making it seem like he's cheating again. She tells the ex that the kids said no.\n\nNow, the key issues here are: Is lying to the kids justified? Is it right to protect them from the ex's new wife? How does the ex's behavior factor in?\n\nThe ex is described as not a good father but wealthy, trying to buy the kids' love. The author's friend says she's wrong, but she disagrees. The author's motivation is to protect the kids from what she perceives as manipulation. But lying to children can have its own consequences, like eroding trust. However, if the ex's new wife is his mistress-turned-wife, maybe the kids are aware of the situation. The author might be shielding them from something harmful, but is lying the right approach?\n\nAlso, the ex is inviting the kids alone, without the author. The author might feel protective, especially given the past cheating. But the kids are teenagers now (13) and a younger one (10), so they might have their own preferences. The author didn't consult them, which could be an issue. However, given the context of the ex's past behavior, the author might believe that the ex is using the trip to manipulate the kids.\n\nIn terms of legal custody, if the author has sole custody, she might have the right to make decisions. But if it's shared custody, maybe the ex has a right to make such plans. The story doesn't specify custody arrangements, which is a missing piece. \n\nThe author's lie might prevent the kids from experiencing something they wanted (Japan), but it also protects them from what she sees as a manipulative situation. The ex's behavior is questionable, so the author's actions could be seen as protective. However, lying could be seen as deceitful, especially if the kids find out later, which might hurt trust.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's intentions and the potential harm from the ex's actions outweigh the harm of lying. If the ex's intentions are manipulative and harmful, the lie might be justified. But if the author's lie is causing more damage to the kids' trust, then she might be in the wrong. The situation is complex, but given the ex's history, the author's actions might be seen as a necessary evil to protect the kids. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole. Answer B.\n"
