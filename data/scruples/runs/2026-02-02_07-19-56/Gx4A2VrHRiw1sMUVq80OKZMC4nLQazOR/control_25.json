In a lot of ways it's still very raw for me. He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love. \n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day. \n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it. I disagree but am open to opposing opinions if any. So am I the asshole for seeing through his manipulation and stopping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her ex-husband about her kids' Christmas plans to prevent them from staying with him and his new wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex cheated with a coworker, and the author was humiliated when she found out. They divorced, and now the ex wants to take the kids to Japan for Christmas, which the author suspects is a way to bond with them using money. The author lied, telling the ex that the kids don't want to go, even though she didn't ask them. She thinks it's a manipulation tactic.\n\nThe friend said she shouldn't have lied, but the author disagrees. The question is whether her actions make her the asshole. \n\nIn legal terms, lying isn't a crime, but in family matters, transparency is usually important. However, the ex's actions might be questionable too. He cheated, and using money to win the kids' favor could be seen as manipulative. The author's intent was to protect the kids from a potentially harmful situation. But lying might interfere with the kids' relationship with their father, especially if they wanted to go. \n\nThe key points are the ex's past behavior, the author's protection of the kids, and the potential manipulation. The author's lie could be seen as a protective measure, but it's also a deliberate deception. If the kids wanted to go, the author might have denied them a chance to have a good experience with their dad. However, if the ex's intentions were truly manipulative, the author might be shielding the kids from that. \n\nIn family law, both parents have rights, but the best interests of the child are paramount. If the author believes the ex is using the trip to manipulate the kids, her lie could be justified. However, if the ex's actions are within his rights as a parent, the author's lie might be unethical. \n\nThe situation is complex. The author's justification is based on protecting the kids from a manipulative ex, which is a common concern in divorce scenarios. The ex's actions might be seen as harmful, but the author's deception prevents the kids from potentially forming a bond with their father. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's actions might be seen as justified given the ex's history and the potential for manipulation. However, some might argue that lying isn't the right approach and that the kids' wishes should be considered, regardless of the ex's intentions. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The author's decision was based on protecting the kids, but it involved deception. Depending on the perspective, she might be in the wrong for lying, but her intent was to shield the kids from a harmful situation. The answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong because the ex's behavior was problematic, and the author acted in the kids' best interest, even if through deception.\n"
