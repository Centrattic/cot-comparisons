I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author making a comment about a coworker's $45 haircut, referencing their own budget and Nelson Rockefeller.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is working as a front desk person, making okay money for their area. They live simply, don't spend on fancy stuff. The coworkers are snooty, talking about their shopping and fancy meals. The author has been polite but maybe felt some tension.\n\nThe key interaction is when the coworker asks about a salon, the author mentions cutting their own hair, leading to a comment about $45 being too expensive. Then the author responds with a sarcastic remark about Nelson Rockefeller and food budget. The coworker felt judged, and others took it as an embarrassment.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to make a joke, perhaps to highlight the income disparity or to show that $45 is a lot for them. However, the coworker felt judged. The question is whether the author crossed a line by bringing up their own financial situation in a way that embarrassed the coworker.\n\nIn workplace interactions, it's important to be mindful of how comments can be received. Even if the author didn't mean to judge, the comment could be seen as mocking the coworker's spending habits. The coworkers might perceive this as an attack on their lifestyle or income, leading to hurt feelings. The follow-up comments from the coworkers (like the farewell card remark) suggest that the author's comment was taken seriously as an embarrassment.\n\nThe author's response was in the context of a conversation where money was discussed. By mentioning their own budget constraints, they might have inadvertently made the coworker defensive or feel that their expenses were being criticized. In professional settings, discussing personal finances can be sensitive, and even jokes about it can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be an asshole, their comment did cause discomfort and was taken as judgment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they should have been more cautious about how their comment could be received, especially in a workplace environment where such topics can be sensitive.\n"
