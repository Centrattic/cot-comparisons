I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drawing attention to income disparities with snooty coworkers. The scenario involves the author, a front desk person, making a joke about a $45 haircut being equivalent to their weekly food budget. The coworkers reacted negatively, feeling embarrassed or judged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworkers are described as snooty and often brag about their purchases. The author's response was a humorous jab, but it's unclear if the coworkers were meant to take it seriously. The key point is whether the author's comment was appropriate.\n\nThe author's intention was to make a joke, but the coworkers took it as an attack. Even if it was meant to be lighthearted, the underlying message about income differences might have come off as confrontational. In a workplace, especially with people from different income levels, making such a remark can create tension. The coworkers' reaction suggests they felt the comment was judgmental, which could be valid if the author's tone or phrasing implied that their spending was excessive or unnecessary.\n\nAlso, the follow-up comment from the coworker about contributing to the farewell card with the author's \"food budget\" shows that the author's remark was remembered and used to mock them. This implies that the initial joke may have crossed a line, making the coworkers feel defensive or leading to retaliation.\n\nWhile the author might not have intended to be an asshole, the impact of the comment matters. The coworkers were already snooty, but the author's response could have exacerbated the situation. It's possible the author was trying to address the disparity by highlighting their own frugality, but in a way that was perceived as passive-aggressive. The use of \"Nelson Rockefeller\" as a joke might have been too pointed, and the reference to the food budget could be seen as mocking their spending habits.\n\nIn professional settings, it's important to maintain a certain decorum. Even if the coworker's behavior was irritating, responding with a joke that touches on financial status can be problematic. The author's actions led to a breakdown in workplace relations, so they might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
