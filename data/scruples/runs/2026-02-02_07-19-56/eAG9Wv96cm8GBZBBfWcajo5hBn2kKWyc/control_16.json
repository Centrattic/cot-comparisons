I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity with snooty coworkers. The author works at a small tech company, makes okay money, but not enough for fancy stuff. The coworkers are snooty, talk about shopping and fancy meals, and the author responds with some comments that led to tension.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their coworkers being judgmental about their thrift store clothes. The key incident is when the coworker asks about the haircut, leading to the author making a joke about the $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworkers took it as an insult and now the author is being accused of embarrassing them and causing hurt feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to deflect or joke, but the coworkers took it seriously. The author wasn't trying to mock them, but the comment might have come off as judgmental. The coworkers were already snooty and making comments, so the author's response was in reaction to that. However, using a joke to highlight income disparity in a workplace can be sensitive. Even if the coworkers were snobbish, the author's comment might have been seen as making light of their spending habits, which could be perceived as a jab. \n\nThe coworkers then retaliated by including the author in a gift without their input, which seems petty. But the initial comment was a reaction to being asked about their budget. The author's response was a humorous way to point out the disparity, but humor can be a double-edged sword. The coworkers felt judged, even if that wasn't the intent. In a professional setting, making such a comment might not be appropriate, even if it's meant as a joke. The author could have chosen a different response to avoid potential offense. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were already creating a snobbish environment, so the author might have just been pushing back. But the key is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since the comment was made in a way that highlighted their own financial constraints in comparison, it's possible that the author crossed a line, even if unintentionally. The coworkers might feel that the author was mocking their spending, hence the fallout. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how the comment would be received, even if the intention wasn't to be malicious. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. For example, if the coworker's comment was provocative, the author's response could be justified. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the coworkers were snooty, the author's reaction might not be appropriate in a workplace setting. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
