I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity at work, specifically between the author and some snooty coworkers. The author works at a tech company's front desk and makes okay money for their lifestyle, but not enough for luxury stuff. The coworkers often talk about their shopping and meals, and the author feels judged when they mention buying clothes from Goodwill.\n\nThe key incident happened when a coworker asked about the author's haircut. The author, who cuts their own hair to save money, mentioned it costs $45, and made a joke about Nelson Rockefeller. The coworker took offense, feeling judged, and others teased the author about contributing to the farewell card.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. Let's break it down. The author's intention was probably to make a joke about the high cost of a haircut compared to their budget. However, the coworkers perceived it as a judgment on their spending. The author might not have realized that bringing up income differences in a workplace, even in a joking way, can be seen as inappropriate or hurtful. \n\nThe coworkers' reaction suggests that they felt embarrassed or judged. The author's comment about the $45 being their weekly food budget might have inadvertently highlighted the income gap, which can lead to tension. While the author wasn't trying to be mean, the context of the workplace and the existing snootiness from the coworkers complicates things. \n\nIn professional settings, discussing income or making jokes about financial habits can be sensitive. Even if the author's intent was humor, the coworkers interpreted it as a critique of their spending. The author might have crossed a line by not considering how their comment could affect others, especially in a work environment where such topics can create discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers started the dynamic by being snooty and making polite snide comments about the author's choices. The author's response was a reaction to the initial judgment they faced. However, the author's joke might have been the catalyst for escalating the situation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were objectively wrong. The author didn't have malice, but the impact of their words caused hurt. In such cases, it's often about the effect rather than the intent. The coworkers felt judged, and the author's comment, while a joke, contributed to that feeling. \n\nTherefore, even if the author didn't mean to be an asshole, the way they expressed their financial reality in that context might have been inappropriate. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they contributed to a tense situation, even if unintentionally.\n"
