I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation involves income disparity and some snooty coworkers. The author works at a tech company, makes a decent amount for their area but can't afford fancy things. The coworkers are bragging about their shopping and meals, and the author responds with a joke about the $45 haircut being their week's food budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworkers are already condescending, making polite but cutting remarks when the author mentions thrift stores. The author was trying to be funny, but maybe it came off as defensive or mocking. The key here is whether the author's response was inappropriate or if the coworkers overreacted.\n\nThe author's comment about Nelson Rockefeller and the food budget was meant to be a joke, but the coworker took it as judgment. The coworkers then excluded the author by contributing to the farewell card without them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nI think the coworkers are being snobbish and creating a hostile environment. The author's response, while maybe a bit direct, was in response to the coworkers' own behavior. The coworkers' reaction seems hypersensitive, using the author's comment as a way to exclude them. However, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe by not making a joke that references their own financial situation in a way that could be seen as comparing themselves to others. But the coworkers were already being judgmental. \n\nSo, the author might not be the asshole here. They were reacting to the snobbery. However, the response might have been a bit harsh or not the best approach. But considering the coworkers' prior behavior, the author's actions were a defense mechanism. The real issue is the coworkers' behavior. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. Maybe the author could have handled it better, but the coworkers are largely at fault here.\n"
