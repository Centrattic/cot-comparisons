I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making a comment about the cost of a haircut compared to their own budget. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author works at a small tech company as a front desk person. They have a modest income and a simple lifestyle. Some coworkers are described as \"snooty,\" often talking about their shopping and expensive meals. The author responds to one coworker's comment about a $45 haircut with a joke comparing their own budget, mentioning that $45 is their weekly food budget. This leads to the coworker feeling judged and others mocking the author.\n\nThe key points here are the interactions between the author and their coworkers. The author wasn't trying to be mean, but their comment might have come off as judgmental. The coworker's reaction suggests that the comment made her feel embarrassed. The author's remark about the $45 being part of their food budget could be seen as highlighting the income disparity, which the coworkers are sensitive about. \n\nHowever, the coworkers themselves are the ones making the initial snooty comments and bragging. The author's response was in the context of a joke, but maybe crossed a line by pointing out the financial difference in a way that made others uncomfortable. The author might have thought it was a light-hearted comment, but in the workplace, even jokes can be misinterpreted, especially when discussing personal finances.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers are also contributing to the tension by making snide remarks about the author's clothes. The author's response was a direct reaction to being judged, which might be seen as defending their own situation. However, the workplace is a shared environment, and making comments about others' spending, even in jest, can create a hostile atmosphere.\n\nThe author's main mistake might be in using their own financial constraints as a comparison in a way that could be perceived as mocking or belittling the coworker's spending. Even if the intention was to show that $45 is a significant amount for them, it inadvertently points out the disparity, leading to feelings of being judged. The coworkers then retaliate by excluding the author in a subtle way with the farewell card comment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the coworkers have their own issues, the author's comment did contribute to the conflict. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since the comment was made in a conversation where the coworker was looking for a salon, the author's response might have been too direct and could have been phrased more diplomatically. The author could have avoided the comment altogether or found a way to deflect without highlighting the financial difference.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for making a joke that unintentionally highlighted the income disparity in a way that upset their coworker. Even if the intention was friendly, the impact was negative. The answer would likely be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because their comment, though perhaps not malicious, contributed to the workplace tension and made the coworker feel judged.\n"
