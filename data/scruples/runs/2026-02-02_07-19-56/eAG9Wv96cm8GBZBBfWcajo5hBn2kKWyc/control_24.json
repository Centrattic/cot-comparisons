I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a front desk person at a small tech company. They have a modest income and a simple lifestyle. Their coworkers, some of them, are snooty and often talk about their shopping and fancy meals. The author responds to their comments with politeness but feels the coworkers are judgmental about their thrift shopping and DIY haircuts.\n\nThe key incident is when the coworker asks about the author's haircut. The author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker then says $45 is worth it for a haircut. The author responds with a joke comparing their budget to Nelson Rockefeller's, pointing out that $45 is their weekly food budget. The coworker felt embarrassed and later the others took the joke as judgmental, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the coworkers were already making snide remarks about the author's affordable choices. The author was trying to be polite but noticed the judgment. When the coworker said $45 is cheap, the author's reaction was a joke to highlight the income disparity. The author probably wanted to show that $45 is a significant amount for them, not just a small expense.\n\nBut the problem here is how the coworkers took it. They felt judged, even though the author's intention was to make a joke. However, in the workplace, even jokes can be sensitive. The author might have overstepped by using a sarcastic comment that could be seen as mocking the coworker's spending habits. Even if the author's intention was to point out the disparity, doing so in a way that could be perceived as judgmental or condescending is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were already making the author feel judged for their simple lifestyle. The author's response was a reaction to being underestimated. The humor used was a defense mechanism but might not have been appropriate in a professional setting. Workplaces usually require maintaining a certain level of decorum, and making light of someone else's spending could be seen as unprofessional, even if it's not meant to be malicious.\n\nSo, while the coworker's initial comments were snobby, the author's response might have escalated the situation. The author's joke could have been perceived as a direct jab at the coworker's financial habits, leading to the coworker feeling embarrassed. The follow-up comments from the coworkers indicate that the author's remark had a negative impact, even if unintended.\n\nTherefore, the author might be at fault for not considering how their comment could be received in a professional environment. Even if they were reacting to being judged, responding with a joke that highlights income disparity in a sarcastic way isn't the best approach. It's possible the author didn't intend to be judgmental, but the method used could have been more tactful.\n"
