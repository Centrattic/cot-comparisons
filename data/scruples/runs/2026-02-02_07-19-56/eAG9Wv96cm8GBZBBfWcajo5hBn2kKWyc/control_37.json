I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a front desk person who made a comment about a $45 haircut being too much for them, comparing it to Nelson Rockefeller. The coworkers then took offense, saying they felt judged.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author wasn't trying to be mean, but they made a sarcastic remark. The coworkers were already being snooty, making comments about the author's thrift store clothes. The author's retort was in response to the $45 comment. But humor can be tricky. Even if it's meant as a joke, if it makes someone feel judged, it might come across as rude.\n\nThe key here is intent vs. impact. The author didn't intend to be an asshole, but their words had a negative effect. The coworker felt embarrassed, and others mocked the author later. The author's comment about the food budget was probably meant to highlight the disparity, but it might have been insensitive. People can take offense even if it's a joke, especially if there's existing tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were already being judgmental. The author was just pushing back, but maybe in a way that wasn't the best approach. The question is whether the author overstepped. The answer likely depends on whether the comment was unkind or crossing a line. The author's comment was a bit of a joke, but it did draw attention to the income disparity in a way that embarrassed someone. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not considering how it would be received. The coworkers are also snooty, but the author's response might have been inconsiderate. \n\nSo, in the AITA context, usually, even if the other person is in the wrong, if your action caused harm, you might still be the asshole. The author's comment, while perhaps not malicious, did contribute to a hurtful interaction. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But there's nuance. The coworkers were also being judgmental. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since their action led to the coworker feeling judged, even if unintentionally, the author might share some responsibility. So the answer could be A. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The author's comment was a sarcastic comparison to Nelson Rockefeller, implying that $45 is way out of their league. This could be seen as pointing out the income gap, but in a way that's condescending or mocking. The coworker took offense, so even if the author didn't mean to, the effect was negative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
