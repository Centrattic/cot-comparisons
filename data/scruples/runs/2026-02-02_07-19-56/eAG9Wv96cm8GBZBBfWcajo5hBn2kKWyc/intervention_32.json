I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and a confrontation over a salon visit.\n\nFirst, the author works at a tech company as front desk, making okay money but not enough for luxury. The coworkers they mention are snooty, shopping at upscale places and making comments. The author responds to a comment about haircuts by making a joke involving their budget, which the coworker took offense to.\n\nThe key points here are about the interaction. The author was asked for a salon recommendation and mentioned cutting their own hair. When the coworker mentioned $45, the author replied with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker felt judged, and others took sides against the author.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author's response was a joke, but it's possible they didn't realize it could come off as judgmental. The coworkers were already snooty, making comments about the author's clothes. The author's retort might have been a reaction to feeling belittled. However, even if there was a sense of being judged, the author's response could be seen as dismissive or mocking, which might have crossed a line.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending their own budgeting and not trying to be mean. On the other hand, making a joke about someone else's expense could be perceived as judgmental. The coworkers' reaction suggests that the author's comment hurt their feelings, even if unintentionally. The author might have been trying to be witty but ended up being offensive. \n\nConsidering workplace dynamics, it's important to be sensitive. Even if the coworkers were snooty, the author's response could have been more tactful. Instead of making a joke about the expense, maybe a different approach would have been better. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their words could be received, even if they didn't intend to judge.\n"
