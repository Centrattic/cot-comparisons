I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they mentioned the $45 haircut comment. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author works at a small tech company as front desk. They mentioned that some of their female coworkers are snooty, going to fancy places and talking about their purchases. The author keeps a modest lifestyle, shops at Goodwill, and cuts their own hair. When a coworker asked about their haircut, the author joked about $45 being the food budget for the week. The coworker took offense, and others spread the comment, leading to some mockery.\n\nThe key points here are about income disparity and how the author addressed it. The author's intention was probably to highlight the difference in spending, maybe to show that $45 is a significant expense for them. But the coworkers interpreted it as the author judging their spending. The question is whether the author crossed a line.\n\nThe author's comment was a joke, but humor can be subjective. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the coworker felt judged. The coworkers then took it further by mocking the author, but the initial comment might have been the trigger. \n\nNow, considering the social dynamics, the author was in a situation where they were already feeling looked down upon (due to comments about their clothes). The joke might have been a way to push back, but using income as a joke could be seen as dismissive or confrontational. \n\nIn professional settings, bringing up income disparities can be sensitive. Even if the author was trying to be humorous, it's possible that it came off as confrontational or sarcastic, leading to the coworker feeling embarrassed. The coworkers' subsequent mockery suggests a power imbalance, but the initial comment might have been the spark.\n\nHowever, the author wasn't outright mean. They laughed it off and thought it was a joke. The coworkers' reaction was unexpected. The question is whether the author's comment was inconsiderate, given the context of their interactions. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because their comment, even as a joke, highlighted a financial disparity in a way that the other person found hurtful. While the coworkers' response was also inappropriate, the author's action started the conflict. The key is whether the comment was unkind or dismissive. Since the author intended to joke but the context was already tense, it's possible they overstepped. So, the answer would be A.\n"
