I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about income disparity and some snooty coworkers. The author works as a front desk person and makes okay money for their lifestyle, but isn't flush with cash. The coworkers are more into fancy shopping and dining, and they sometimes make polite, but maybe snide comments about the author's thrift store outfits.\n\nThe key incident was when a coworker asked about a salon for a haircut. The author mentioned cutting their own hair to save money. The coworker was surprised and said a decent haircut costs $45. The author then quipped, \"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" and later compared $45 to their food budget. The coworker ended up feeling embarrassed and judged, and others started excluding the author, like with the farewell card money.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the coworkers are already making snide remarks in a polite way. The author is reacting to their implied judgment by pointing out their own financial situation. The author's comments were meant as a joke, but they might have crossed a line. \n\nThe problem here could be about how the author responded. Even if the coworker was making a snide comment, the author's response could be seen as mocking the coworker's expense. By saying that $45 is their weekly food budget, it's highlighting their own poverty in a way that might be hurtful or belittling. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about losing weight by using the food budget for hair might be taken as sarcastic and could be seen as making fun of the coworker's spending. Even if the author didn't mean to be an asshole, the effect is that they embarrassed the coworker, leading to social exclusion. \n\nBut then again, the coworkers were the ones initiating the snooty comments. The author might feel that they're being judged and are just pushing back. However, the way they did it might have been inappropriate. The coworker felt judged, and the author's remarks could be seen as a form of retaliation that's not constructive. \n\nIn a workplace, even if there's tension from others, the appropriate response might be to address the behavior rather than escalate. The author's response, while a reaction to the coworker's implied judgment, might have crossed into making the coworker feel judged in return. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's intention was to point out the income disparity and possibly defend their own lifestyle. However, the method they used could be seen as unprofessional or hurtful. Even if the coworkers were snooty, the author's response might have contributed to a toxic environment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding in a way that led to embarrassment and social exclusion, despite their intentions.\n"
