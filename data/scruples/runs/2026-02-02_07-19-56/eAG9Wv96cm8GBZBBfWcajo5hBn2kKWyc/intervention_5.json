I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is at fault here. So the situation is about income disparity and a comment made during a conversation about haircuts.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company as front desk. They have a modest lifestyle, not spending on fancy stuff. The coworkers are snooty, going to fancy places and showing off. The author responds to one coworker's comment about $45 haircuts by referencing their own budget constraints humorously. The coworker took offense, and others mocked the author later.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was inappropriate. The author tried to make a joke about the $45 being their weekly food budget, which they thought was funny. But the coworker felt judged and embarrassed. The others then retaliated by mocking the author's contribution to the farewell card.\n\nNow, the author's intention was probably not to mock the coworker but to express their own financial reality with humor. However, the context is important. The coworker had already been snooty and judgmental about the author's shopping habits. The author's response was in the same conversational context where there was already some tension and snide remarks. \n\nThe problem is that even though the author tried to respond with humor, it might have come across as pointing out the income disparity in a way that the coworker found offensive. The coworker might have felt that the author was mocking her for spending $45 on a haircut when the author can't afford that. The author's comment could be seen as a subtle jab, even if unintended. \n\nAlso, in a workplace setting, it's important to maintain professionalism. Even if the conversation was casual, the author's response crossed into personal territory and could be seen as unprofessional. The coworkers then retaliated, which complicates the office environment.\n\nBut the author wasn't trying to be mean. They were reacting to the coworker's comment and the previous snooty behavior. However, the line they chose to use might have been too direct or could be perceived as confrontational. The humor here might not land well in a professional setting, especially when it's about personal finances. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment might have been inappropriate in the context, leading to the coworker feeling judged. Even if the intention was not malicious, the impact is what matters here. The coworkers' reactions suggest that the author's words were hurtful, so the author might be at fault for not considering how their words could be received.\n"
