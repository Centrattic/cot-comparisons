I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pointing out the income disparity with their coworkers. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author works at a small tech company and has a modest income. They work at the front desk, and some coworkers are described as \"snooty.\" These coworkers often talk about their shopping and fancy meals, which the author politely comments on. The key incident is when the author responds to a coworker's comment about a $45 haircut with a joke referencing Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker took offense, leading to some social tension.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's response was inappropriate. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author was reacting to a comment that implied their financial situation was different. They made a joke about the $45 being part of their food budget, which could be seen as highlighting the income gap. The coworkers took it as a personal attack or judgment. On the other hand, the author wasn't trying to be mean, just expressing surprise. The coworkers might be sensitive about their own spending, and the joke could have been perceived as mocking their habits.\n\nIn workplace scenarios, especially in small offices, comments about money can be touchy. Even if the author's intent was light-hearted, the impact was negative. The coworkers felt judged, and the author's response might have crossed a line by making a direct comparison that could be seen as belittling. The use of a joke in this context might not have been appropriate, as it could come off as confrontational rather than humorous.\n\nAlso, the coworkers' subsequent actions (like excluding the author from the farewell card fund) show that the comment affected their relationships. The author's reaction, while not malicious, inadvertently caused hurt feelings. Workplace etiquette often requires being mindful of how comments about personal finances are received, as they can touch on sensitive topics of class and income disparity.\n\nTherefore, even if the author didn't mean to be an asshole, the impact of their words led to a rift. So, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong because their comment, though made in jest, was perceived as judgmental and caused a negative reaction among their coworkers.\n"
