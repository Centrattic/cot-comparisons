I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a front desk worker who is dealing with coworkers who they consider snooty. The main conflict arises when the author responds to a comment about the cost of haircuts with a joke referring to Nelson Rockefeller, implying that $45 is a lot for them. The coworker took offense, and others followed up with sarcastic comments about the farewell card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the coworkers often brag about their purchases and lifestyles, creating a snooty atmosphere. The author's response was a joke, but it backfired. The key points are whether the author's comment was unkind or inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's intention was to make a lighthearted joke, but the coworker felt judged. The phrase \"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" could be seen as sarcastic, but it's not inherently malicious. However, the follow-up about the food budget might have been perceived as defensive or mocking. The coworkers then escalated the situation with the farewell card comment, which was clearly meant to be snide.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author was responding to a situation where they were already made to feel judged (about their thrift store clothes). Their reaction was a joke, which was misinterpreted. However, the author could have chosen a different response. Making a joke about money in a workplace where there's already tension about income disparities might not be the best approach. The coworkers, on the other hand, have been creating a snooty environment, which contributed to the conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were unkind. The author wasn't attacking the coworker but was reacting to their own discomfort. However, the joke about the food budget could have been seen as highlighting the income gap in a way that made the coworker uncomfortable. The coworkers then retaliated, which is their fault, but the author's initial response might have been a bit insensitive, even if unintended.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coworkers' behavior is problematic, the author's joke might have been a bit tactless given the context. But considering the coworkers' prior behavior, the author's response could be seen as a justified reaction to being judged. The main issue is whether the author's comment crossed a line. Since the author was trying to be humorous and wasn't directly attacking, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in professional settings, making light of financial differences can be tricky. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's some nuance here.\n"
