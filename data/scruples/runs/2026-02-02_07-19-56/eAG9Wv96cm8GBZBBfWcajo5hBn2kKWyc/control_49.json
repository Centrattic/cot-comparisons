I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and a joke made during a conversation about haircuts.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company as front desk. They mention making okay money but not enough for fancy things. Their coworkers are snooty, bragging about shopping and meals. The author responds to a comment about a $45 haircut with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker took offense, felt judged, and others snickered about it later.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention was to make a joke, but the coworker felt embarrassed. The coworkers' behavior was already snooty and judgmental. The author's comment was a reaction to the coworker's comment about the value of a $45 haircut. The author's financial situation is different, and they were pointing out the disparity.\n\nBut in social interactions, even if the other person is being judgmental, responding with a sarcastic or humorous comment can be seen as retaliating. The author's joke might have been intended to highlight the income gap, but it could have come off as mocking or belittling, especially if the coworker was genuinely speaking from a different perspective. The coworkers then took it further by mocking the author in return, but the initial comment from the author was the trigger.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The answer depends on whether the author's response was a reasonable defense against perceived snobbery or if it was unkind. The author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to the coworkers' behavior. However, the way they expressed it could have been more tactful. But considering the context of the coworkers' previous behavior, the author's reaction might be justified. Alternatively, the author could have handled it without making a joke that could be perceived as confrontational.\n\nThe coworkers' reaction might be an attempt to deflect their own snobbery. The author's joke was a direct comparison, which might have been the right call to challenge the coworkers' attitude. However, in a workplace, even if someone is snooty, making a joke about their spending could be seen as unprofessional. The author's response might have crossed a line, even if the coworkers were being snobby.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they made a jab that was unprofessional and could have been hurtful, even if the coworkers were snobby. Or B (not in the wrong) because they were responding to the coworkers' behavior and pointing out the disparity. The key is whether the author's response was an appropriate reaction. Given that the author was trying to make a point about income differences, and the coworkers were being judgmental, maybe the author isn't the asshole. But the joke might have been in poor taste. Hmm. Need to decide based on social norms. In many cases, making a joke about someone's spending in a sarcastic way could be seen as rude. So maybe the author is at fault. But if the coworkers were already being judgmental, the author's response was a form of self-defense. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could be A or B. Let me check the original question again. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's comment was unprofessional or just a justified reaction. Given that the author was pointing out the income disparity in a humorous way, but it could have been taken as mocking. The coworkers then escalated it by making a joke about the farewell card. The author might not be in the wrong because they were responding to the coworkers' behavior. So maybe B.\n"
