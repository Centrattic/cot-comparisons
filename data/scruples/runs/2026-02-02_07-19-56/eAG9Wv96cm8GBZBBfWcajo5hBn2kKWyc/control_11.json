I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person works at a small tech company as a front desk employee. They have a modest income and lifestyle, but some of their female coworkers are snooty and brag about their shopping and fancy meals. When asked about their outfits, the author mentions buying from Goodwill and gets a polite but dismissive response. Then there's an interaction about a $45 haircut, where the author responds with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker felt embarrassed, and others started snickering and excluded the author from a farewell card fund.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about income disparity and the author's response to the comment about the $45 haircut. The author's intention was to joke, but it came off as making a snide comment about the coworker's spending, which the coworker took as judgment. Now, the question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The initial comment by the coworker about $45 being worth it implies that the author is in a different financial bracket. The author's reply of \"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" and mentioning the food budget might have been a way to highlight their own financial constraints. But in doing so, they might have made the coworker feel judged or embarrassed about her spending habits. Even if the author didn't mean to be mean, the effect was there, leading to the coworker feeling judged.\n\nIn workplaces, it's important to be sensitive to others' feelings. Even if a coworker is being snooty, responding with a jab\u2014however humorous\u2014can escalate tensions. The author's comment could be seen as pointing out the disparity in a way that's condescending. The coworker's reaction and the subsequent exclusion from the fund suggest that the author's words had a negative impact. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were just making a joke and didn't intend to be offensive. But the problem is that the joke fell flat and caused hurt feelings. In such cases, even if the intention wasn't bad, the behavior still had a negative effect. The author might not be the sole asshole, but they did contribute to a hostile work environment by not considering how their words would be received.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's response was inappropriate even if unintended. The coworkers' reaction indicates that the comment crossed a line. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault here.\n"
