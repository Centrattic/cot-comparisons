I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about income disparity and a confrontation at work.\n\nThe author works at a tech company as a front desk person. They mention their coworkers are snooty, buying expensive things and making comments about the author's thrift store outfits. The key incident is when the author jokes about a $45 haircut being their weekly food budget, which the coworker seems offended by and tells others. Now the coworkers are being snarky about a farewell card, implying the author shouldn't contribute from their \"food budget.\"\n\nSo, did the author cross a line? The author's comment was a joke about the cost, which they intended as light-hearted. But the coworker felt judged. The author might have overstepped by pointing out the price difference in a way that embarrassed someone. Even if it was a joke, it might have come off as mocking their spending habits. The coworkers then used that to make a passive-aggressive comment about the farewell card, which shows the author's comment had negative consequences.\n\nThe author's defense is they were just joking, but in a professional setting, comments about money can be sensitive. The coworkers from higher income backgrounds might see the joke as belittling their spending, while the author might feel they're being judged for their frugality. However, the author's response could have been perceived as judgmental, even if not intended. The fact that the coworker felt embarrassed and others took sides suggests the author's actions led to a hostile work environment. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's comment, while perhaps meant as a joke, did contribute to a situation where colleagues felt it was okay to make passive-aggressive remarks. So, the answer is likely A\u2014author is in the wrong.\n"
