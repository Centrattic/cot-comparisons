I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at a small tech company as front desk. They mention they make okay money for their area but can't afford luxuries like fancy vacations or clothes. They live modestly, camping or staying home when they take time off.\n\nThe coworkers (some of them) are described as snooty. They go shopping at fancy malls, talk about their purchases, and sometimes make polite comments about the author's thrift store clothes. The author doesn't mind these comments too much, as they're not as bad as other coworkers. \n\nThe key incident is when a coworker asks about the author's haircut. The author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker reacts with a snort and says $45 is worth it. The author then says, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" and later adds that $45 is their weekly food budget. The coworker felt judged and embarrassed, leading to the other coworkers excluding the author in a farewell card gesture by not making them pay.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The author's intention was to highlight the income disparity and maybe make a joke about the other person's assumption. But the coworker took it as personal judgment. The author's comment about their own budget could be seen as showing the other person's privilege, which might come off as judgmental. However, the author was responding to the other person's dismissive comment about $45 being cheap. \n\nIn this situation, while the author's statement was direct, it's possible they weren't intending to be rude. However, the way they expressed it might have been taken the wrong way. The coworker likely felt that the author was mocking their spending habits. The author's joke about their food budget could be seen as a counter-joke, but it might have been perceived as belittling. Even if the author didn't mean to, the coworker felt judged, which could make the author responsible for the reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's initial comment was snooty, so the author's response might be a justified reaction to that. But in a workplace setting, making such comments can create tension. The author's approach might not be the best way to handle it, but it's a common situation where people misunderstand each other's intentions. \n\nThe key is whether the author's words were unkindly intended. The author says they were joking and didn't mean to sound like an asshole. However, the effect on the coworker was negative. Even if unintentional, the author's comment might have crossed a line by making a comparison that highlighted the coworker's spending in a way that was embarrassing. In professional environments, such remarks can be problematic regardless of intent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their comment could be received.\n"
