I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pointing out income disparities to their snooty coworkers.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author works at a small tech company as front desk. They have a modest income and a simple lifestyle. Some female coworkers are snobbish, talking about their shopping and fancy meals, and making polite but judgmental comments about the author's thrift store outfits. \n\nThe key incident: When asked about a salon for a haircut, the author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker responds with a $45 price, implying it's cheap. The author retorts with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker is upset, others mock the author, and the author feels targeted.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The coworkers were already making snide remarks about the author's spending habits. The author's response was a humorous way to highlight the income gap they experience. However, the author did directly point out the $45 expense in a context that the coworkers found offensive. \n\nOn one hand, the author was defending their own lifestyle and pointing out the disparity in a light-hearted manner. On the other, the joke might have been taken as mocking the coworker's spending or implying that she's wasteful. The coworkers felt judged, even if that wasn't the author's intention. \n\nThe key here is intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean to be judgmental, but the comment did make the coworker feel judged. In a workplace, it's important to be mindful of how others might perceive your comments. Even if the author's intention was just to show their own financial constraints, the context of the previous interactions (the snooty behavior) might have made the coworkers more sensitive. \n\nHowever, the coworkers also contributed to a toxic environment by their own behavior\u2014snide remarks and exclusivity. The author's response could be seen as a justified pushback against that snobbery. But the way it was delivered might have crossed a line, especially if it was done in a way that the coworker felt embarrassed. \n\nIn the end, while the coworkers were snobbish, the author's direct comment about the $45 expense could have been a bit tactless. Maybe there's a middle ground, but given the context, the author's intent wasn't malicious. Still, the impact was negative, so there's a case to be made that the author should have approached it differently. However, the coworkers' behavior also set the stage for this conflict. \n\nBut given the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were inappropriate. Since the author's comment was a reaction to the coworkers' prior judgy behavior, perhaps the author isn't entirely at fault. But they did escalate the situation, so there's a bit of both. However, in a typical AITA scenario, the answer often comes down to the impact, so maybe the author is slightly in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. \n\nWait, the author made a joke that was in poor taste. Even if they were reacting to the coworkers' behavior, the joke about spending $45 on hair being compared to their food budget could be seen as mocking. The coworker felt judged, which is a valid feeling. The author's response wasn't just pointing out the disparity but doing so in a way that highlighted their own financial situation in a way that made the coworker feel bad. So, even if the coworkers were snobbish, the author's comment was perhaps not the best approach. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they made a comment that, while reacting to prior behavior, still ended up making someone feel judged.\n"
