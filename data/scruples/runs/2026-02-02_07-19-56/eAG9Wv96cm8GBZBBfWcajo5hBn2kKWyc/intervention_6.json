I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who works at a small tech company, noticing income disparities with some snooty coworkers. The key incident is when the author jokes about $45 being a week's food budget after a coworker mentions a $45 haircut. The coworkers felt judged and now the author is being excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The author's coworkers are spending on luxury items, while the author lives modestly. The author's response was a joke about the cost, which the coworkers took as judgment. The question is whether the author's actions were inappropriate.\n\nThe author's intention was to point out the disparity in a humorous way, but the coworkers perceived it as an insult. The author might have overstepped by using their own financial situation to highlight the other's spending, which can come off as judgmental. Even if the author didn't mean to be snide, the comment about the food budget could be seen as belittling the coworker's spending. \n\nHowever, the coworkers also have a history of making snide remarks about the author's thriftiness, so there's a context of mutual tension. The author's response was in reaction to the coworker's comment about the $45 haircut, which might have been a trigger point. The humor used, though, might have been the wrong approach because it could be offensive regardless of intent.\n\nIn professional settings, even jokes can lead to misunderstandings. The author's comment might have been taken as a personal attack on the coworker's spending habits. The coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author from the farewell card contribution, which is a form of social punishment. \n\nConsidering the dynamics, the author's comment was a direct comparison that highlighted their own financial constraints in a way that could be perceived as mocking the coworker's expenses. Even if it was meant as a joke, the context of prior interactions (coworkers making polite but snobbish comments) suggests that the author's response was reactive and crossed into being judgmental, leading to the coworkers feeling embarrassed or judged. \n\nSo, while the coworkers aren't without fault for their snobbiness, the author's choice of words and the way they framed the financial comparison likely contributed to the situation escalating. The author's joke about the food budget being spent on hair might have been the wrong approach in a professional setting. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not anticipating how their comment could be received and for engaging in a way that led to tension.\n"
