I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by pointing out the income disparity with their coworkers. The situation involves the author working at a small tech company, making an okay amount but not enough for luxury items. Their coworkers are snooty, shopping at fancy places and making comments about the author's thrift store outfits. Then there's the incident with the haircut comment.\n\nThe key points here are about the interaction where the author jokes about $45 being a week's food budget. The coworkers took offense, feeling embarrassed or judged. The question is whether the author was in the right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the conversation. The coworker asked about a salon, the author mentioned cutting their own hair due to cost. Then, when the coworker mentions $45, the author's reaction is a humorous retort. But the coworkers felt it was judgmental. \n\nIn workplace dynamics, it's important to consider how comments can be perceived, even if they're meant as jokes. The author's comment might have been intended as a light-hearted way to highlight the expense, but it came off as mocking the coworker's spending habits. The coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author in a subtle way with the farewell card comment. \n\nThe author might not have intended to be offensive, but the way the comment was made could be seen as belittling. The phrase \"I'm Nelson Rockefeller\" is a sarcastic way of pointing out the expense, which could be interpreted as mocking. Even if the author was just trying to be funny, the impact on the coworkers matters. The coworkers felt embarrassed, leading to a breakdown in workplace relations. \n\nWorkplace etiquette generally advises against making jokes that highlight economic differences, as it can create tension. The author's response, while perhaps a reaction to being snooted at, might have crossed a line. The coworkers' reaction, while petty, is a common response when someone feels judged. \n\nSo, the author's comment, even if not malicious, contributed to a negative situation. The question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the comment was about income disparity in a way that caused offense, and the author was reacting to the coworkers' own snobbery, it's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of workplace behavior, making a joke about someone's spending habits can be seen as unprofessional, especially if it leads to exclusion. \n\nI think the author is partly at fault here. They could have handled the situation differently, perhaps without making a joke that highlights the economic gap in a mocking way. Even if the coworkers were snooty, the author's response likely exacerbated the issue. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their comment, though possibly intended as a joke, was unprofessional and offensive to the coworkers, leading to a hostile work environment.\n"
