I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and a conflict between coworkers. The author works at a small tech company as front desk. They mention that they have a modest lifestyle and can't afford the things their snootier coworkers do. The coworkers shop at fancy places and talk about their purchases, and the author feels a bit looked down on when they mention getting clothes from Goodwill. \n\nThe key incident happened when a coworker asked about the author's haircut. The author explained they cut their own hair because salons are expensive. The coworker replied that $45 is cheap, and the author reacted with a sarcastic comment about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. This led to the coworker feeling judged, and others took sides, making a comment about the author's contribution to a farewell card.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let me think. The author's comment was sarcastic and compared their own budget to the $45 haircut. They might have intended it as a joke, but the coworker took it as an insult. The coworkers then acted out of spite by putting money from the author into the card. \n\nOn one hand, the author was probably just reacting to feeling looked down on. They were trying to highlight the income disparity in a humorous way. But on the other hand, sarcastic remarks can come off as judgmental, even if unintended. The author's joke might have been perceived as mocking the coworker's expense, making her feel defensive. Also, in a workplace, such comments can create tension, even if the intention was to deflect snobbery.\n\nBut then, the coworkers were already being snooty, so maybe the author's reaction was a justified defense of their own financial situation. However, the way they expressed it might have crossed a line. The author's comment could be seen as belittling the coworker's expense, implying that $45 is a lot for them, which could make the coworker feel judged. The coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author from the farewell card in a way that mocks their financial situation.\n\nSo, there's a bit of both sides. The author was defending themselves against perceived snobbery, but the method might have been unprofessional. The coworkers' reaction is also unprofessional. But in terms of who's at fault, maybe the author did overstep by making a sarcastic comment that was taken as judgmental. Even if it was a joke, in a professional setting, it's better to avoid such remarks that can be interpreted negatively. The fact that others took sides and retaliated shows that the comment had a negative impact. So the author might be partly at fault. However, the coworkers' behavior in the first place was also problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they made a joke that was taken the wrong way and caused tension, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should have handled the situation differently. Alternatively, if the coworkers were being snooty, the author's reaction might be a reasonable pushback. It's a bit tricky. But in the end, the author used sarcasm which could be seen as unprofessional and hurtful, even if unintended. So probably A.\n"
