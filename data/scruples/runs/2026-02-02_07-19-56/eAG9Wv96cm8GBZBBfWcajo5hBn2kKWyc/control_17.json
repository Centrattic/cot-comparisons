I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for pointing out the income disparity with their coworkers. They work at a tech company as front desk, make okay money but not enough for fancy stuff. Their coworkers are snooty, shopping at fancy places and bragging. The person responds with humor when a coworker mentions a $45 haircut, comparing it to Nelson Rockefeller and their own food budget. The coworker took offense, and others snickered later.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. The user is trying to highlight the difference in spending by joking about their own budget. But the coworkers felt judged. The question is whether the user was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the user didn't intend to be mean, just to point out the expense. But when someone says something like \"I can't afford that,\" it can come off as implying that the other person is spending unnecessarily or being pretentious. Especially when they use a joke about their own budget, which might be perceived as mocking the coworker's spending. \n\nAlso, the coworkers were snooty first, making comments about the user's clothing. But does that justify the user's response? Maybe not directly. The user's comment was in response to the coworker's remark about the haircut being worth it. The user's reaction might have been a bit of a jab at the expense, which could make the coworker feel like their spending is being judged. \n\nIn a workplace, even if there's a class difference, it's important to maintain professionalism. The user's comment, while maybe intended as a joke, could be seen as making the coworker feel embarrassed about their spending. The coworkers then retaliated by excluding them in a way (paying for the card without them). \n\nSo is the user in the wrong? They didn't mean to be, but their comment could be seen as crossing a line by bringing up their own financial constraints in a way that highlights the other's privilege, which might come off as passive-aggressive or judgmental. Even if the coworkers were snooty, responding with humor that points out the disparity could be perceived as the user being an asshole. \n\nAlternatively, the user might just be standing up for their own situation. But in a social context, comparing one's own budget in that way could be unkind. Maybe the user should have just accepted the compliment and changed the subject instead of making a joke about the price. \n\nI think the answer is that the user is in the wrong because their comment, even if well-intentioned, led to the coworker feeling judged. Workplace interactions require care to avoid such situations, so pointing out financial differences in a humorous but pointed way isn't advisable. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
