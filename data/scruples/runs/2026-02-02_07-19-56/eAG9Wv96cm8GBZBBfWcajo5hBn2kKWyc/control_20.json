I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their response about the $45 haircut. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author works at a small tech company and has a modest lifestyle. Some coworkers are snooty, often talking about their shopping and fancy meals. The author responds to their comments with humor, which backfired when they compared the cost of a haircut to their food budget. The coworker felt judged, and others took it as a joke at her expense.\n\nThe key points here are about social dynamics and perceived judgment. The author's comment was made in a conversational context, but the coworkers interpreted it as a jab at their spending habits. The author didn't intend to be offensive, but the response was taken the wrong way. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were trying to highlight their own financial constraints in a light-hearted way. However, bringing up income disparities in a work setting, especially when it's not directly relevant to the conversation, can be sensitive. The coworkers might feel that the author is making them feel guilty or superior. \n\nThe snooty coworkers' behavior is also a factor. They were already making comments about the author's outfits, which is snobbish. But the author's response was a direct comparison that could be seen as mocking their spending. Even if it was meant as a joke, the context of the workplace and the existing tension means that the line between humor and offense can be thin. \n\nIn social situations, especially at work, it's important to consider how others might perceive your words. The author's comment, while possibly not malicious, did lead to the coworker feeling judged. The coworkers' subsequent actions (like excluding the author from the farewell card) show that the joke was taken seriously as an insult. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be an asshole, their actions had negative consequences. The right thing would have been to avoid making a joke that could be interpreted as a jab at someone's financial choices. Therefore, the author might be at fault here.\n"
