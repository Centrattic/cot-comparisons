I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author works at a small tech company and has colleagues who they find snooty. These women talk about their shopping and expensive dinners, and when the author mentions getting clothes from Goodwill, they get condescending smiles. Then there's the incident with the $45 haircut. The author made a joke comparing that amount to their food budget, which upset the coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author was out of line. The key points are about the income disparity and the reaction. The author isn't trying to be mean, just pointing out the difference in their spending. But the coworker felt judged. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, the author was responding to a comment about the cost of a haircut. When the coworker said $45 is worth it, the author's joke about that being their weekly food budget might come off as mocking their spending habits. Even if it was a joke, it could make the other person feel embarrassed, especially if they're in a different financial situation. The coworker might have felt that the author was belittling their choice to spend on hair, which is a personal matter. The author's comment could be seen as drawing attention to their own financial constraints in a way that's not constructive and possibly hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker initiated the conversation about haircuts, and the author was just being honest about their own habits. The author might not have intended to mock but to express their own reality. However, humor can be tricky in such contexts. Even if it's not meant to be offensive, the way it's received matters. The coworker's reaction suggests that the joke wasn't well-received, leading to embarrassment and exclusion in the farewell card incident.\n\nThe author's actions did lead to the coworker feeling judged. While financial discussions can be sensitive, the author's response might have crossed the line by highlighting the income gap in a way that made the coworker feel uncomfortable. The snarky comment about Nelson Rockefeller and the food budget could be seen as making light of the other person's financial privilege, which isn't the author's place to do, even in jest. It's possible the author didn't intend harm, but the impact is what's important here.\n\nSo, considering the coworker's feelings and the resulting exclusion, the author's joke, though perhaps not malicious, did cause hurt. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being mindful of how their words affected the other person, even if they didn't mean to.\n"
