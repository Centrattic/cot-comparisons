I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author responding to a coworker's comment about haircuts by referencing their own budget constraints, which led to some snide remarks from the coworker and others.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author works at a small tech company and has a modest income. They have a simple lifestyle, which means they can't afford the same luxuries as their more affluent coworkers. The coworkers in question are described as \"snooty,\" often bragging about their shopping and meals. The author feels they're being judged when commenting on their own thrift store clothes.\n\nThe key incident happens when the author is asked about cutting their own hair. The coworker mentions that a decent haircut costs $45, and the author responds by comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller and mentioning the $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker then reacts with a tight-lipped smile, and others later approach the author, saying they embarrassed the coworker and made her feel judged.\n\nNow, considering the social dynamics here. The author might have felt that the coworker's comment about a $45 haircut was out of touch with their own financial reality. By making a joke about their own budget, the author was likely trying to highlight the income disparity in a humorous way. However, this could come off as mocking or belittling the coworker's spending, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nFrom the coworkers' perspective, the author's comment might have been perceived as judgmental. The coworker who asked about the salon might have been making a genuine inquiry, and the author's response could be seen as pointing out the economic gap in a way that makes her feel uncomfortable. The follow-up comments from other coworkers suggest that they took the author's joke as a jab at the coworker's spending habits, leading to social tension.\n\nThe author's intention is important here. They mention they weren't trying to be an asshole and were shocked by the $45 price. The comment was made in a lighthearted tone, but intentions don't always align with how others receive the message. The coworkers felt judged, which is a key point in these AITA scenarios.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's not wrong to have financial constraints, bringing up one's own financial situation to contrast with another's spending can be seen as a form of passive-aggressive judgment. Especially in a workplace, maintaining a certain level of decorum is expected. The author's response might have crossed a line by making the coworker feel self-conscious about her expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker and others have been creating a snooty environment, which could contribute to the author feeling defensive. However, the author's response might have been an overreaction that escalated the situation. The follow-up comments about the farewell card suggest that the coworkers are now using the incident to mock the author, which complicates things further.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while the coworkers have contributed to a snooty atmosphere, the author's direct comparison and joke about the budget might have been the catalyst for the social tension. It's a mix of both parties' behaviors, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's comment was the immediate cause of the coworker's discomfort, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
