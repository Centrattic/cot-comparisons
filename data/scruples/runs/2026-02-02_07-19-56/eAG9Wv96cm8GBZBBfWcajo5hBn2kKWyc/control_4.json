I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and some snooty coworkers.\n\nFirst, the author works at a tech company's front desk. They have a modest income and lifestyle, not spending on fancy things. The coworkers they mention are snooty, going to fancy malls and bragging about their purchases. The author responds to their comments with humor, like comparing a $45 haircut to their food budget. The coworkers took offense, leading to tension and some snide remarks.\n\nThe key points here are the interactions. The author didn't mean to be judgmental but used a joke to highlight their financial situation. The coworkers felt judged, which is a common issue in such scenarios. The author's comment about the food budget might have been a way to explain their perspective without being confrontational. However, the coworkers took it as an insult. \n\nNow, considering social dynamics, when someone points out their own financial limitations in response to others' comments, it's usually not meant as an attack. But the coworkers might feel that the author is mocking their spending habits. However, the author's reaction was in response to the coworker's own comment about the value of $45 for a haircut. So it's a bit of a back-and-forth. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The author's intent was likely to explain their own situation and maybe lighten the mood with humor. The coworkers took it the wrong way, but the author didn't outright insult them. The snooty coworkers started the dynamic by making comments about the author's clothes and then the haircut. The author's response was a self-deprecating joke that the coworkers didn't find funny. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author could have handled it differently, but the coworkers also contributed to the tension by being judgmental. The author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to the coworkers' attitude. The coworkers' sensitivity might stem from feeling their lifestyle is being questioned. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because their comment was a response to the coworkers' behavior and was made in a light-hearted way without intent to insult.\n"
