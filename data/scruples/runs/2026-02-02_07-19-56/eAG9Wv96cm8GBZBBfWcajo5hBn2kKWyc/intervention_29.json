I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pointing out the income disparity with their snooty coworkers. The situation involves a front desk worker at a tech company who's making enough for a modest lifestyle but not for the fancy things their coworkers do. The coworkers are snotty, making polite but clearly condescending comments about the author's thrift store clothes. Then there's this interaction about a $45 haircut, where the author makes a joke comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller and mentions that $45 is their weekly food budget. The coworkers took offense, felt judged, and now are excluding the author in a subtle way with the farewell card comment.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about intent and how the coworkers perceived the comments. The author's defense is that they weren't trying to be an asshole, just being honest about their budget. But the coworkers felt embarrassed and judged. The question is whether the author was wrong for making that comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworkers are already making snide remarks about their own shopping and meals, and the author is reacting to their condescension. The author's response was in a joking manner, but the coworkers took it seriously. The problem here might be that even if the author wasn't trying to be mean, their comment highlighted the income gap in a way that made the other person feel shamed. \n\nIn social interactions, what's considered acceptable can vary. The author used humor to point out the absurdity of the $45 price for a haircut, which might have come off as mocking the expense in a way that the other person took personally. Even if it's a joke, if it makes someone feel judged, it's possible that the author overstepped. \n\nHowever, the coworker's reaction seems a bit hypersensitive. The author's comment was a direct response to the coworker's dismissive attitude. The author didn't attack her for spending $45; they just pointed out that it's expensive for them. The coworker then took it as a personal attack. But in a workplace, there's a line between personal finances and professional respect. The author didn't criticize the coworker's spending choices, just contrasted their own budget. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's use of \"Nelson Rockefeller\" might have been a bit too much, as it's a direct reference to immense wealth, which could imply that $45 is a trivial amount for the coworker, thus highlighting the disparity in a way that's condescending. That could be why the coworker felt embarrassed. The author's intention was to be honest and maybe even humorous, but the effect was hurtful. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were reacting to the coworker's own snobbery. However, their response could have been handled more diplomatically. Instead of making a joke that could be misread, maybe a simple statement about budgeting without the sarcastic remark might have been better. But the core issue is whether the author's actions were inappropriate. \n\nIn the end, while the author's intent wasn't malicious, the way they expressed their point may have crossed a line. The coworkers' reactions suggest that the comment was perceived as judgmental, even if it wasn't intended that way. Workplace dynamics require a certain level of tact, and the author's response, though perhaps justified in context, may have been unwise. Therefore, the author is somewhat at fault for not considering how their words might be received, even if the coworkers were the ones being snobbish first.\n"
