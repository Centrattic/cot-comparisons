I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making a joke about a $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at a small tech company and is the front desk person. They have a modest income and lifestyle, buying secondhand clothes. The snooty coworkers often talk about their shopping and fancy meals, and the author responds politely but notices their subtle snobbery. \n\nThen, when a coworker asks about a salon, the author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker reacts with surprise and comments on the price. The author responds with a sarcastic joke, comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller and mentioning that $45 is their weekly food budget. The coworker is offended, and others take the author's comment as judgmental. Now there's tension, and the coworkers have snickered about the author's contribution to a farewell card.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's comment was a joke, but the coworkers took it as offensive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the social dynamics. The coworkers were already showing their wealth through their spending, and the author felt they were being judged for their modest lifestyle. The author's response was a humorous way to highlight the income disparity but ended up making the coworkers feel criticized.\n\nIn social situations, when someone comments on their spending, responding with a joke about their price being too high for you can be seen as a backhanded compliment or even a jab. Even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the effect was that they embarrassed the coworker. The coworkers' reaction (tight-lipped smile, later spreading the comment) suggests that they felt judged. The author's comment might have crossed a line by making light of their own financial situation in a way that highlighted the disparity, which could be perceived as undermining the coworker's choice to spend $45 on a haircut.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to be funny, not to criticize. The problem is that humor can be a thin line, and in this case, it didn't land well. The coworkers might have felt that the author was belittling their spending habits. The author's response could be seen as passive-aggressively pointing out their own poverty in front of others, which might come off as a subtle jab at the coworker's extravagance.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were already showing off their wealth, so maybe the author's comment was a reaction to that. But even so, the way it was delivered might have been offensive. The key here is whether the author's words, regardless of intent, were perceived as judgmental or disrespectful.\n\nIn professional settings, especially in small offices, comments like this can create tension. The author's remark about the food budget was specific and made the coworker feel that their $45 was seen as unnecessary. The coworkers then retaliated by including the author in the card without their input, which shows the fallout from the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intention was not malicious, but the effect of their words caused harm. The author is in the wrong because they made a comment that led to the coworker feeling judged and created a hostile work environment. Even if the author didn't mean to, the impact of their words matters. So, the answer would be A.\n"
