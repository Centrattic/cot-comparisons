I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about income disparity and a workplace interaction.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company as a front desk person. They mention making \"okay money\" for their area but not enough for luxuries like vacations or fancy meals. Their coworkers, some women, are described as snooty, going shopping at upscale malls and then talking about their purchases. The author responds politely but feels the coworkers make condescending comments about their thrift store outfits.\n\nThe key incident: The coworker asks about a salon, the author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker seems surprised, the author makes a joke about $45 being like Nelson Rockefeller's budget, and then says $45 is their weekly food budget. The coworker gets upset, and later others mock the author by saying they'll pay for the farewell card.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. Was the author's response appropriate? The author was reacting to the coworker's comment about $45 being worth it. The joke was about their own budget constraints. But the coworker took offense, feeling judged. The author's intention was probably to highlight the income disparity, but it came off as mocking or dismissive. \n\nThe author might not have intended to be mean, but the comment did draw attention to their own financial limitations in a way that could be seen as passive-aggressive. The coworker might feel that the author is making a judgment on their spending, even if that's not the case. The follow-up comments from the coworkers suggest that they feel the author embarrassed her, and the author's subsequent interactions were strained.\n\nIn workplace dynamics, even if the income disparity exists, bringing it up in a humorous way might not be the best approach. The author's comment could be interpreted as belittling the coworker's spending. The coworkers' response indicates that they felt the author was making them look negative. \n\nSo, while the author's intention wasn't to be an asshole, the action did cause offense. The question is whether the author should have known better. The author might not have realized that the comment could be taken as judgmental. However, in a workplace, especially with coworkers who are already snooty, making a joke about their expenses could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author's response was in the context of a conversation where the coworker was discussing their own purchases and the value of a salon. The author's joke was about their own budget, but it's possible that it was meant to highlight the difference, which could be seen as mocking. The coworkers' reactions support that they felt judged. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the author didn't intend to be rude, the comment did cause offense and led to further mockery. The author's response was inappropriate in that context, making them at least partially to blame. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
