I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and a comment made during a conversation about haircuts.\n\nThe author works at a small tech company and makes enough for their lifestyle but not for fancy things. Some coworkers are snooty, talking about shopping and meals. When the author mentions cutting their own hair due to cost, the coworker comments on the $45 price. The author responds with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and the food budget, which the coworker took as judgment and offensive. Now there's tension.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The author's intention was to make a joke, but the coworker felt judged. The key points are intent vs. impact. Even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the words made the coworker feel embarrassed. The phrase \"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" implies that $45 is a lot for the author, which could come off as mocking the coworker's expense. Also, mentioning the food budget as a comparison might have been offensive, implying that spending $45 on hair is frivolous compared to food. \n\nThe coworkers' reactions after, like the farewell card comment, suggest that the author's remark had lasting negative effects. Even if the author was just trying to share their own situation, the way it was phrased could be seen as highlighting the income disparity in a way that made others feel judged. The author might not have considered how their comment could be perceived, even if it was offhand. So, maybe the author did cross a line by making a joke that wasn't well-received and led to exclusion. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker was the one who first mentioned the $45 price with a snort, which the author might have felt was judgmental. The author's response was a reaction to that. But even so, the author's comment could have been taken as retaliating, which is where things went wrong. The coworkers' subsequent behavior (excluding the author from the card) seems like their own choice, but the author's initial comment likely contributed to the tension.\n\nI think the main issue is that the author didn't consider the potential impact of their joke. Even if it was meant to be lighthearted, it came off as judgmental. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
