I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about income disparity and how the author responded when a coworker commented on a $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author works at a small tech company as front desk. They mention making okay money but not enough for luxuries. The coworkers are described as snooty and often talk about shopping at high-end stores. The main conflict occurs when the author jokes about $45 being their weekly food budget in response to a coworker's comment about the haircut cost.\n\nThe author's response was a joke, but it led to the coworker feeling embarrassed, and others took it as the author being judgmental. Then, the coworkers made a passive-aggressive comment about the author's contribution to the farewell card. \n\nI need to determine if the author's actions were inappropriate. The author's intention was to make a joke, not to belittle the coworker. However, the context is that the coworkers are already snooty and the author's comment might have been perceived as mocking their spending habits. Even if the author didn't mean it, the response could come off as snarky or condescending. \n\nThe key points are: the author was responding to a comment they found surprising, made a joke about their own budget, and didn't realize it was taken the wrong way. The coworkers didn't handle it well afterward by being passive-aggressive, but does that absolve the author? Maybe not entirely. While the coworkers are at fault for their snobbery, the author's joke might have crossed a line by implying that the coworker's spending is wasteful or that the author is poorer. The author could have said something like, \"I can't afford that, but I'm happy with my own budget,\" without the sarcastic remark. \n\nIn workplaces, even jokes can be misinterpreted, especially when there's a class divide. The author's comment might have been seen as judgmental, even if unintended. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words could be taken, leading to hurt feelings. However, the coworkers also have their part in creating a judgmental environment. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to confirm. The main issue is whether the author's response was unkind or unprofessional. Since the author's joke was about their own budget in a way that could be seen as comparing or mocking, it's possible they did overstep. Even if they didn't mean to, the impact is what matters. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
