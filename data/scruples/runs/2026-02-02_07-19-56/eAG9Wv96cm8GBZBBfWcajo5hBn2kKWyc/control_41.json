I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and a comment made during a conversation about haircuts.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author works at a small tech company, is the front desk person, and has a modest income. They mention that they live simply, so their expenses are low. The coworkers they're talking about are snooty, going to fancy places and bragging. The author is being polite but gets comments about their thrift store clothes.\n\nThe key moment is when the author responds to the $45 haircut comment with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker took offense, and others spread the comment, leading to some mockery about the farewell card.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to make a joke about the price being high for them, not to judge the coworker. However, the coworker felt judged. The question is whether the author's response was inappropriate.\n\nIn these situations, the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often looks at intent versus impact. The author's intent was not to be mean, but the impact was hurtful. Even if it was a joke, bringing up income disparities in a workplace can be sensitive. The author might have crossed a line by highlighting their own financial situation in a way that made others uncomfortable, even if it was meant as a joke.\n\nBut then again, the coworkers started the dynamic by being snooty and making comments about the author's clothes. The author was responding to a comment that implied that $45 is cheap. The author's response might have been a way to point out the income disparity without being confrontational. However, using humor in such contexts can sometimes backfire, especially if it's perceived as passive-aggressive.\n\nThe coworkers then took the joke and used it to mock the author further, which complicates things. The author's initial comment might not have been the worst thing, but in a workplace, it's generally advisable to avoid topics that can lead to tension. The author's response, while perhaps a joke, did highlight their financial situation, which the coworker found offensive. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the joke was meant to judge or if it was an innocent comment that had unintended consequences.\n\nIn most cases, even if the coworker was snooty, the author might be advised to avoid such retorts in the workplace. The author could have responded differently, maybe saying something about saving money or not needing expensive things without referencing their own budget in a way that contrasts with the coworker's. So, maybe the author did overstep, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a bit of a nuanced situation.\n"
