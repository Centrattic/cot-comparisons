I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by pointing out the income disparity with their snooty coworkers. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company as front desk. They mention their income is okay for their lifestyle, but not enough for fancy things. The coworkers are described as snooty, with their fancy shopping and meals, and they mock the author's thrift store outfits. The key incident happens when the author is asked about a salon, and they mention cutting their own hair due to cost. The coworker comments on the $45 price being worth it, and the author responds with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker felt judged and embarrassed, leading to the author being excluded from a farewell card contribution, which the coworkers then mocked.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to highlight the income difference, perhaps to show that $45 is a big expense for them. But the coworkers took it as an insult. The author might have thought they were joking, but the coworkers felt judged. The problem here is that the author's comment, while perhaps meant as a lighthearted joke, might have been perceived as pointing out the disparity in a way that made the coworker defensive or embarrassed. \n\nSnooty behavior from the coworkers doesn't justify the author's response. Even if the coworkers are being snobbish, responding with a comment about their income relative to the author's can come off as passive-aggressive or confrontational, especially in a workplace setting. The author's comment about the food budget being used for hair might have been an attempt to highlight their own financial constraints, but it could have been seen as a jab at the coworker's spending habits. \n\nMoreover, the coworkers' reactions\u2014excluding the author from contributing to the farewell card and mocking them\u2014suggest that the dynamic became strained. The author's response might have escalated the situation rather than resolving it. Even if the author didn't intend to be judgmental, the coworker felt judged, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nIn workplace interactions, it's important to consider how comments might be received, even if the intent is to be humorous. The author's joke might have crossed a line by using a personal financial detail in a way that highlighted social differences, leading to hurt feelings. The coworkers' snootiness doesn't excuse the author's behavior, but the author's response could have been more tactful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions led to a conflict where the coworker felt judged. Even if the intent was to point out income disparity, the method used might not have been appropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
