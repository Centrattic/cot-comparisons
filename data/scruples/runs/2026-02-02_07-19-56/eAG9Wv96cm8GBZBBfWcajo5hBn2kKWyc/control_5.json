I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about income disparity and a confrontation over a haircut cost.\n\nFirst, the author works at a tech company as front desk. They mention their modest lifestyle, not needing fancy stuff. The coworkers are snooty, going shopping and bragging, then making polite but dismissive comments when the author mentions shopping at Goodwill.\n\nThen there's the interaction about the salon. The coworker suggests $45 is a good price for a haircut, which the author reacts to with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker takes offense, and others spread the comment, leading to mockery in the farewell card context.\n\nNow, the key points: Was the author wrong? Well, the author's intention was to make a joke, not judge. They were surprised by the high cost. The coworkers, however, felt judged and embarrassed. But is the author at fault?\n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, comparing incomes or mocking others' spending can be sensitive. The author's comment was a reaction to the coworker's own comment. They didn't directly attack the coworker's lifestyle but highlighted the expense. However, even if it's a joke, it might come off as passive-aggressive. The coworkers' response was to mock the author's budget, which complicates things.\n\nBut considering that the author was the one who brought up the comparison by referencing their own budget, maybe they overstepped. Even if in a joke, it could be seen as pointing out the disparity, which the coworker took as judgment. However, the coworker's initial comment about $45 being worth it might have been a trigger. The author's response was a defense of their own financial choices, not necessarily an attack.\n\nIn these situations, it's about perspective. The author might not be wrong for defending their choices, but the way it came out could have been better. However, the coworkers' reaction is also problematic for mocking the author's budget. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be the sole fault, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, the question is if they are in the wrong. The answer might be A or B.\n\nWait, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's comment was a reaction to the coworker's comment. They used humor, which didn't land. But is that their fault? Or is the coworker's sensitivity the issue? The coworkers then took it further by mocking the author's budget. The author's initial comment was a response to the coworker's snootiness. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to the other's comments. However, the way they expressed it might be seen as a slight. It's a judgment call. Some might say the author overstepped by using a joke that highlighted income disparity, while others might say they were just being honest.\n\nIn the AITA context, often the person who is defensive or passive-aggressive can be seen as the asshole. The author's joke might be passive-aggressive, implying that $45 is too much for a haircut, which could be seen as judging the coworker's spending. So, maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But the coworker's behavior was also snooty. It's a balance. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The answer might depend on the perspective. But in the end, the author's comment was a direct comparison that could be seen as mocking the cost, hence AITA would be A. Alternatively, since the coworker started the snooty behavior, maybe not. Hmm.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was a direct attack. They didn't say the coworker was wrong, but they highlighted their own budget constraints as a joke. The coworker took it as judgment. Since the author was defending their own choices in a joking way, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the way they did it could be seen as passive-aggressive. The answer might lean towards A (Yes) because the comment, even in jest, could be interpreted as judging the coworker's expense. Alternatively, B (No) if it's seen as self-defense against the coworker's initial judgment. I'm torn, but in AITA scenarios, often the person who makes a passive-aggressive comment about money is considered the asshole. So answer A.\n"
