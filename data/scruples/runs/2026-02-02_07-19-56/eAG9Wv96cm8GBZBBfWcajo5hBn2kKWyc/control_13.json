I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about income disparity and a confrontation with snooty coworkers.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company and is the front desk person. They mention their income isn't enough for fancy stuff but they don't need it. The coworkers are snooty, going to fancy places and bragging. The main incident was when a coworker asked about a salon, the author mentioned cutting their own hair, leading to a comment about $45 for a haircut. The author then joked about comparing it to their food budget, leading to the coworker feeling embarrassed and subsequent snide remarks.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about how the author responded. The coworker made a comment about $45 being the cost, and the author's reply was a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworkers took offense, feeling judged or embarrassed.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was inappropriate. The author was responding to what they perceived as the coworker's snobbery. They were pointing out the income disparity in a humorous way. However, humor can be subjective. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the coworkers felt judged. The author's comment might have come off as defensive or confrontational, especially in a workplace where maintaining a certain image is important for the snooty coworkers. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers have been making snide remarks about the author's thriftiness, so the author might have felt justified in pointing out the hypocrisy. However, the way it was done might have been unprofessional or hurtful. The coworkers were paying for a haircut, and the author's comment about their own budget could have been seen as mocking their spending habits. \n\nIn workplace dynamics, even if there's a snobbery issue, it's important to maintain professionalism. The author's joke might have crossed a line, even if it was meant as a lighthearted retort. The coworkers' reaction shows that it was taken as an attack, which might not have been the author's intention. So, the author could be considered at fault for not handling the situation more tactfully. They could have addressed the snobbery without making a comment that could be perceived as judgmental, especially in a professional setting. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their response, while perhaps a reaction to being judged, led to further tension and was unprofessional. However, there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) if the coworkers were already being judgmental and the author was just pushing back. But given the outcome, the author's response likely contributed to the problem, so A is possible.\n"
