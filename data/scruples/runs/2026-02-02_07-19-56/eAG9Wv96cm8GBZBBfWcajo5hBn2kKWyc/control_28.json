I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. They provided a detailed scenario where the author, who's a front desk person, is dealing with snooty coworkers. The main issue is about pointing out the income disparity when talking about a $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author mentions that the coworkers are snooty, often talking about their purchases and fancy meals. When asked about their own haircut, the author compares the $45 to their weekly food budget and makes a joke about losing weight. The coworker took offense, felt judged, and others later mocked the author in a group context.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the tone and intent of the author's response. The author says they weren't trying to be an asshole but were genuinely shocked by the $45 price. However, the way they phrased it, especially with the Nelson Rockefeller comment and the joke about the food budget, could come off as defensive or confrontational. Even if it was meant as a joke, the context is a workplace where there's already a dynamic of the author feeling looked down upon. By bringing up the cost, they might have inadvertently highlighted their own financial situation in a way that the coworkers found embarrassing or offensive.\n\nThe coworkers, on the other hand, might be sensitive about their spending habits, especially if they've been making snide remarks about the author's thriftier choices. The author's response could be seen as a put-down, even if not intended. The follow-up comments from the coworkers suggest they felt targeted, and the author's comment about the food budget was taken as a jab.\n\nWorkplace interactions are tricky. While the author was reacting to perceived judgments, responding in a way that emphasizes the cost of a service and makes a joke about their own expenses might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author's comment crossed a line by making a comparison that the coworker found humiliating. The coworkers might have felt that the author was mocking their spending or subtly pointing out that they can't afford such luxuries, which could be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author's initial response was to a perceived snootiness and price shock. The question is whether they overstepped. The coworkers' reactions indicate that they did feel judged, so the author's intent versus the impact is a factor here. Even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the statement might have been taken as such. In professional settings, it's important to be mindful of how comments are received, even if they're meant as jokes.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response, while perhaps meant as a joke, did make the coworker feel judged and led to further tension. The workplace is a shared environment, and even if the coworkers are snooty, the author's comment could have been seen as a low blow, especially when it came to personal finances which is a sensitive topic.\n"
