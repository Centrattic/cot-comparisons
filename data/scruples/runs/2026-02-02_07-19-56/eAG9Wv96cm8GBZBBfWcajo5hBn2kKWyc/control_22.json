I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pointing out income disparities with their snooty coworkers. They work at a small tech company as front desk, make okay money for their area but can't afford fancy stuff. Their coworkers, some of them, are snooty, going to malls and bragging about their purchases. The author responds with humor when a coworker mentions a $45 haircut, comparing herself to Nelson Rockefeller and mentioning her food budget. The coworker was offended, and others took it as judgmental.\n\nSo, the key points: The author's intent was to make a joke, but the coworker felt judged. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the author was reacting to the coworker's comment about the $45 haircut being worth it. By saying \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" and then linking it to her food budget, the author is highlighting the difference in their financial situations. The coworker took it as mockery, hence the follow-up about not wanting to cut into the food budget for the farewell card. \n\nBut was the author's response inappropriate? Well, the author wasn't being mean, but the comment could be seen as pointing out the income disparity in a way that might make the coworker uncomfortable. The coworker might feel that the author is criticizing her spending habits or looking down on her for being able to afford $45 haircuts. However, the author's tone was joking, and they laughed it off. \n\nThe coworkers' reaction was to mock the author by referencing the food budget again, which shows that the dynamic is mutual. The author was trying to be humorous, but the coworkers are using the situation to belittle her. \n\nIn this case, the author might not be in the wrong because they were responding in kind to a situation where the coworkers were already being snooty. The author's comment was a defense mechanism against perceived judgment about their own lifestyle. However, it's possible that the author could have handled it more tactfully without making a direct comparison to their budget. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were already making comments about the author's outfit, so the author might have been trying to level the playing field. The key is whether the author intended to humiliate the coworker. Since they said it was a joke and didn't mean to be an asshole, maybe they're not in the wrong. The coworkers' subsequent actions (mocking the farewell card contribution) indicate that they're the ones escalating the situation. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not the Asshole) because the author was responding to the coworkers' snobbery and wasn't intentionally malicious. The coworkers took offense, but the author's actions were a reaction to their own being judged, and the coworkers are continuing to mock the author. The author isn't the one who started the dynamic, they were just pushing back in a lighthearted way.\n"
