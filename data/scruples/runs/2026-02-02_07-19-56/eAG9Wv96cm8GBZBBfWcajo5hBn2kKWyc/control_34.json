I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author works at a small tech company as front desk. Their coworkers are some women who seem to be a bit snooty, talking about their shopping and expensive meals. The author has a more modest lifestyle, shopping at places like Goodwill and cutting their own hair to save money.\n\nThe key event is when one of the coworkers asks about a $45 haircut, and the author responds with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker took offense, and others later confronted the author, leading to some mockery. The author is now wondering if they were the asshole.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether the author's response was inappropriate. Let's break it down. The author was reacting to a comment where the coworker implied that a $45 haircut is worth it. The author's retort was to compare that amount to their own food budget, suggesting that for them, $45 is a significant expense. The coworker felt judged, and others joined in, which makes the author question their actions.\n\nFirst, the author's intention. They mentioned they weren't trying to be an asshole and thought they were joking. However, humor can often be misinterpreted, especially in a workplace setting. The coworker's reaction was one of being hurt, so maybe the author's joke crossed a line. Even if it was meant as a lighthearted comment, it might have come off as sarcastic or dismissive of the coworker's perspective.\n\nAlso, the context of the workplace is important. The coworkers are already seen as snooty, and the author might be feeling the disparity in their lifestyles. But by bringing up the income difference in a joking manner, the author might have inadvertently highlighted their own financial situation in a way that made others uncomfortable. The coworker might have felt that the author was mocking their spending habits or implying that their choice to spend $45 on a haircut is wasteful.\n\nBut then again, the coworker also made a comment about the haircut being worth it, which could be seen as looking down on the author's more frugal approach. The author's response was to point out the economic difference, which might be a valid reaction, but using humor here might not have been the best approach. The problem is that the coworker took it as judgment, and the author's follow-up comments (about the food budget) could be seen as emphasizing their own financial constraints in a way that's uncomfortable for others.\n\nIn workplace dynamics, it's important to maintain a certain level of decorum. Even if the author's intention was to make a joke about the disparity, doing so in a public or semi-public setting (like at work) can lead to tension. The coworker's subsequent actions (telling others and mocking the author) show that the dynamic shifted, and the author might have contributed to that by not backing off or apologizing when the coworker showed discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might have been the one initiating the conversation with a comment that could be seen as snobbish. The author was just responding to that. However, the author's response, while perhaps a reaction to the coworker's attitude, might have been more direct than necessary. The phrase \"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" is a bit of a sarcastic remark, which can come off as defensive or confrontational.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might have overstepped by using a joke that highlighted the income disparity in a way that the coworker found offensive. Even if the author didn't mean to be mean, the impact of the words matters. The coworker felt judged, and the author's continued joking about the food budget might have made the situation worse. Therefore, the author could be at least partially at fault for not considering how their words might be received, especially in a professional environment where such tensions can escalate.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the coworkers were the ones creating a hostile environment by constantly showing off their wealth, and the author was just reacting to that. But in a workplace, it's generally better to avoid such topics unless everyone is on the same page. The author's joke might have been a way to call out the snobbery, but it might not have been the most diplomatic approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coworker's actions were also questionable, the author's response, though perhaps intended as a joke, contributed to the conflict. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they did play a role in escalating the situation. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were responding to the snobbery, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, considering the impact of their words and the potential for misinterpretation, maybe A (they are in the wrong) is the better answer. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again.\n\nThe key points: The author was reacting to the coworker's comment about the value of a $45 haircut. The author's response was a joke about their own budget. The coworker felt judged. The author's intention was not to be an asshole, but the effect was hurtful. In such cases, the impact is what matters. So, even if the author didn't mean to, their words caused offense, so they might be in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
