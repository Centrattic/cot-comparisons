I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nThe author works at a small tech company as a front desk person. Their income is okay but not enough for luxury expenses. The coworkers in question are \"snooty,\" and there's a disparity in their spending habits. The key incident is when the author joked about a $45 haircut being part of their food budget, which the coworker found offensive. The coworkers then mocked the author in a group setting, referencing the same joke. \n\nFirst, I should consider the social dynamics here. The coworkers are already making the author feel judged when they mention thrift store clothes. The author's response to the $45 comment was a joke, but it seems the coworker didn't find it funny and felt embarrassed. The follow-up from the coworkers was a clear indication that the author's comment was hurtful. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The main issue is the use of humor to highlight income disparity. The question is whether the joke was appropriate. The author might have thought it was light-hearted, but the coworkers perceived it as judgmental or belittling. \n\nIn professional settings, teasing or jokes about money can easily be misinterpreted, even if intended as a joke. The author's comment could be seen as passive-aggressive, implying that the coworker's $45 haircut is unreasonable given the author's own financial situation. The response from the coworkers, especially the snide remarks about the food budget, suggests that the author's actions led to some form of social retaliation. \n\nHowever, the coworkers were the ones who initially brought up their spending and made the author feel judged. The author's reaction might be a form of self-defense or asserting their own position. But even so, using a joke to point out the disparity could come across as confrontational. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was probably to show that $45 is a significant amount for them, but the delivery might have been inappropriate. The coworkers' reaction is valid, but the author might not have intended to cause offense. \n\nIn the end, while the coworkers were the first to make the author feel snooty, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line by referencing their own budget in a way that highlights the other's wealth. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They could have responded differently without resorting to a joke that caused discomfort.\n"
