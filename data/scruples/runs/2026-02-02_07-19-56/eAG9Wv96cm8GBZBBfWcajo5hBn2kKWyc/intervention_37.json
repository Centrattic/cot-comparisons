I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author works at a tech company as front desk. They have a simpler lifestyle, buying secondhand clothes and not spending much. Some of their coworkers are snobby, talking about fancy things and making snide comments. The key incident is when the author responds to a coworker's comment about a $45 haircut by making a joke about that being their weekly food budget. The coworker took offense, and now the author is being excluded and mocked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is dealing with coworkers who are already making them feel looked down upon. The author's response was in jest, but it backfired. The question is whether the author was wrong to point out the income disparity. \n\nThe author's intention was probably to highlight the contrast between their own budget and the coworker's, but in a humorous way. However, humor can sometimes miss the mark. The coworker felt judged, which is a key point. Even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the response could be seen as mocking the coworker's spending habits. The author might have thought it was a light-hearted comment, but in the context of the existing snobbery, it could have come across as defensive or confrontational.\n\nThe coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author from the farewell card contribution, which is a form of passive aggression. The author's actions might have been the catalyst for this, even if unintended. The main issue is whether the author's comment was unkind or unprofessional. While the author was reacting to prior snobbery, the response escalated the tension. In a workplace, maintaining a respectful environment is important, and even jokes can affect that. \n\nThe author may not have intended to be an asshole, but by calling out the income disparity in a public way, even if it was a joke, it could have made the coworker feel embarrassed. The colleagues' reaction shows that the comment had a negative impact. So, the author's actions, while perhaps in self-defense, led to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not considering how their response might affect others, even if the coworkers were snobby. The right approach might have been to acknowledge the difference without making a joke that highlights the disparity in a way that could be perceived as mocking.\n"
