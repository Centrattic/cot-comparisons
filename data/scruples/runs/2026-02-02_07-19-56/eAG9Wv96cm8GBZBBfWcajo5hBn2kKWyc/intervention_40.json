I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pointing out the income disparity with their snooty coworkers.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author works at a tech company and is the front desk person. They have a modest income and a simple lifestyle. The coworkers they mention are snooty, going to fancy places and showing off. The author responds to a comment about a $45 haircut by making a joke about their own budget, referencing Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworkers took offense, felt judged, and now there's tension.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author says they weren't trying to be an asshole and were just shocked by the $45 price. But the coworkers felt embarrassed or judged. The author's response was a joke, but it might have crossed a line. Even if it was a joke, bringing up someone's income in a way that highlights their wealth could be seen as confrontational, especially in a workplace where there's already some tension.\n\nThe coworkers' reactions suggest they felt the comment was a jab at their spending habits. The author's follow-up about the food budget being used for hair might have been meant to be humorous but could come off as sarcastic or dismissive. The coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author in the farewell card gesture, which shows the dynamic is now strained.\n\nIn workplace interactions, it's important to consider how comments might be received, even if they're meant as jokes. The author's response, while perhaps not malicious, did draw attention to the income disparity in a way that made the coworkers uncomfortable. The fact that they had to clarify their intent and now keep to themselves suggests that their actions contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the way they responded might have been perceived as such. The coworkers felt judged, and the author's retort could be seen as passive-aggressive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the potential impact of their words in that context.\n"
