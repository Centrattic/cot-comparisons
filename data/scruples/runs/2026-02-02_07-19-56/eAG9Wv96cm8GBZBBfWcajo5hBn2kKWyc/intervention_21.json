I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a front desk worker at a small tech company who confronts coworkers about the disparity in income when they talk about their expensive habits.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the coworkers are snooty, going to fancy places and making comments about the author's thrift store outfits. The key incident happens when a coworker asks about a salon, and the author responds with a joke about $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworkers took offense, feeling judged and that the author embarrassed them.\n\nSo, the main points are: the coworkers made the author feel looked down upon, but the author's response was a joke about the cost of a haircut. The coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author from a group activity, implying they had to cover for the author.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The coworkers might have been insensitive by making their comments, but the author's response could be seen as a direct jab at their spending. Even though the author was defending their own financial situation, using a joke that highlights the disparity might have crossed a line. The coworkers felt judged, and the author's comment about the food budget could have been perceived as mocking their spending habits.\n\nHowever, the author was also on the receiving end of snobbery. The coworkers made comments about their outfits, so the author's response might have been a reaction to that. But humor is subjective. What one person sees as a joke, another might see as an affront. The author didn't intend to be mean, but the coworkers took it poorly. The fact that they later excluded the author by saying they'll cover the farewell card cost suggests that the author's comment might have been the trigger.\n\nIn the context of workplace dynamics, even if the coworkers were snooty, the author's response could be seen as unprofessional. They used a joke that highlighted the income gap, which might have made the coworkers defensive. The coworkers might feel that the author is judging their spending, even if it's not the case. The author's comment about the food budget could be seen as insinuating that the coworkers are wasteful, which could be hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might have overstepped. While the coworkers were being snobby, the author's response was a joke that could reasonably be seen as offensive. The coworkers felt embarrassed, and the author's comment about the food budget was a direct comparison that might have been perceived as mocking. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their response, though possibly not malicious, did cause offense and tension in the workplace.\n"
