I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and a comment made in response to a coworker talking about haircuts.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is a front desk person making a modest income, living a simple lifestyle. The snooty coworkers, especially one woman, talk about their shopping and fancy meals. When the author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive ($45), they make a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker felt embarrassed, and others took it as judgment, leading to some snide remarks later.\n\nThe key points here are the initial comment and the reactions. The author's intention was probably to make a lighthearted joke, highlighting the disparity without malice. But the coworkers took it as judgment. The question is whether the author is wrong for pointing out the income gap, even if it was in a joke.\n\nFrom a social dynamics perspective, even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the comment might have been perceived that way. Income disparities can be sensitive, and using another person's expense as a point of comparison, even in jest, can come across as mocking. The coworkers' reactions suggest they felt judged about their spending habits. However, the author was defending their own financial reality. \n\nBut the problem is whether the author overstepped. The comment was in response to the coworker's snark about the cost of a haircut. The author's retort was a direct comparison to their own budget, which could be seen as a witty way to highlight the difference. However, in a work environment, even jokes can have consequences, especially when they touch on personal finances. The coworkers might have felt that the author was belittling their spending, even if that wasn't the intention. \n\nThe snooty coworkers were already making comments about the author's thrift store clothes, so there was an existing dynamic of one-upmanship. The author's response was a flip side of that. But in a professional setting, such exchanges can create tension. The author's comment might have been the first time they directly addressed the disparity in a verbal way, which the coworkers found hurtful. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily wrong because they were responding to an implicit judgment from their coworkers. However, the manner in which they addressed it\u2014publicly in a joking way\u2014might have been inappropriate. The coworkers' reactions led to exclusion (like not including them in the card), but the original comment was in a work setting, which could affect workplace relations.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's joke was an acceptable response or if it crossed a line. Since the coworkers felt judged and the workplace environment became tense afterward, the author might be considered at fault for not handling the situation more delicately. However, the initial snootiness from the coworkers also plays a role. \n\nIn many cases, the burden is on the person making the joke to consider the context and audience. Even if the coworkers were snooty, the author's response could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their comment, while perhaps a reaction to snobbery, could be seen as judgmental and unprofessional in a work setting.\n"
