I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making a comment about the $45 haircut to snooty coworkers. \n\nFirst, the context is that the author works at a small tech company and makes a modest income. The coworkers in question are described as snooty, often bragging about shopping and fancy meals. The author's income is such that $45 is a significant portion of their weekly food budget.\n\nThe key incident is when the coworker mentions $45 for a haircut, and the author responds with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker took offense, and the situation escalated with the coworkers mocking the author by referencing the food budget.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is at fault but wants a second opinion. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, the author was reacting to what they perceived as the coworker's casual attitude towards a $45 expense. The author's comment was likely meant to highlight the disparity in their financial situations. However, the way it was delivered\u2014mocking the expense as absurd\u2014could be seen as judgmental or confrontational. Even if the author didn't intend to be rude, the comment might have come off as snide, especially given the context of the coworkers being snooty. \n\nThe coworkers' reaction suggests they felt judged, which is a valid feeling. The author's use of humor here might have been inappropriate, as it could be interpreted as belittling the coworker's spending habits. Additionally, the follow-up comment about losing weight by cutting into the food budget adds a layer of mockery that could be seen as mean-spirited.\n\nHowever, considering the author's financial situation and the coworkers' own behavior, there's a case to be made that the author was responding to a provocation. The coworkers were already making snide remarks about the author's thriftiness, so the author might have felt justified in pointing out the income disparity. That said, the method of response\u2014joking about the expense in a way that highlights the author's own financial constraints\u2014might not have been the best approach. A more direct but respectful conversation might have been better than a sarcastic comment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coworkers' behavior was certainly rude, the author's response, though perhaps intended as a joke, contributed to the tension and could be seen as unprofessional. The author's comment may have crossed a line by mocking the coworker's expense, leading to the perceived judgment. Therefore, the author is likely at fault here.\n"
