I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask an Animal post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and social interactions at work. The author works at a small tech company and has a modest lifestyle. Some of their coworkers are described as \"snooty,\" often talking about their shopping and fancy meals. The author feels a bit looked down on when they mention buying clothes from Goodwill.\n\nThe key incident happened when a coworker asked about their salon, and the author mentioned cutting their own hair. The coworker then made a comment about $45 being the cost of a decent haircut. The author responded with a joke referring to themselves as Nelson Rockefeller and made a comment about the $45 being their weekly food budget. This led to the coworker feeling embarrassed and judged, and later, the coworker and others snickered at the author, excluding them from the farewell card contribution.\n\nNow, considering social norms and workplace etiquette, the author's response might have been a bit sharp. While the coworker first made a judgment about the cost, the author's witty retort could be seen as defensive. However, the coworker's initial comment might have set up a dynamic where the author felt justified in pointing out the income disparity. But in a workplace setting, teasing about money can be sensitive. Even if the author was trying to be humorous, it's possible that the coworkers took it the wrong way, especially since they later excluded the author.\n\nThe coworkers' reaction suggests they felt judged, even if the author didn't intend to. The author's comment about the food budget could have been perceived as mocking the coworker's spending habits, which might not be appropriate in a professional environment. The follow-up exclusion (not asking for contribution to the farewell card) indicates that the coworkers took offense. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely at fault for pointing out the disparity, but the way it was done (using sarcasm and referencing their own financial situation) might have crossed a line. Workplace interactions should ideally maintain respect, and while humor is okay, it can sometimes backfire. The coworkers' response was unprofessional, but the initial comment from the author could have been handled more tactfully. So, there's a balance here. The author might not be entirely the asshole, but there are elements where they could have been more careful in their approach.\n"
