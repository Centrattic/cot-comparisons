I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and some snooty coworkers. The main event is when the author responds to a coworker's comment about a $45 haircut with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author works at a tech company as front desk, makes okay money but not enough for fancy things. The coworkers are described as snooty, bragging about their purchases and making polite but judgmental comments. The author's response was a sarcastic remark about the $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker took offense, leading to the author being called out for embarrassing her and later being mocked about contributing to a farewell card.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. From the description, the author was reacting to a situation where they felt their lifestyle choices were being judged. The coworker's initial comment about $45 being worth it for a haircut might come off as condescending. The author's response was a humorous way to highlight the income disparity, but the coworker took offense. \n\nNow, the key points: was the author's response appropriate? The author tried to make a joke, but it backfired. The coworkers' behavior was not nice either, with snide comments and exclusion. However, the author's comment did point out the financial difference, which might have made the coworker feel called out. The author's intention was probably to defend themselves from perceived judgment, but the effect was that it embarrassed the coworker. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about intentions vs. impact. The author might not have intended to be mean, but the impact was hurtful. The coworkers then retaliated by mocking the author. However, the author's initial comment was a reaction to the coworker's snobbery. The question is whether the author overstepped by making a direct comparison to their budget. \n\nOn one hand, the author was responding to a situation where they were being judged. On the other hand, bringing up money can be a sensitive topic. The author's response was a bit of a direct jab, even if it was a joke. It's possible that the author's intention was to highlight the disparity, but in a way that could be seen as sarcastic or dismissive. \n\nThe coworkers' behavior was also snooty, but the author's actions did escalate the situation. The snide remarks from the coworkers might not make the author's response justified. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the author did make a comment that was personal and possibly hurt the coworker's feelings, even if it was meant as a joke. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the coworkers were snooty, the author's response was a direct jab at the coworker's financial habits, which is a sensitive topic and could be seen as judgmental. Even if the author was reacting to judgment, pointing out the income disparity in a sarcastic way might have been inappropriate. The coworkers then retaliated, but the initial comment from the author could be seen as contributing to the problem.\n"
