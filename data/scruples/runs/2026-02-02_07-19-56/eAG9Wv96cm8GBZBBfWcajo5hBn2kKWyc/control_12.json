I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and a conversation that went sideways.\n\nThe author works at a small tech company as front desk. They have a modest lifestyle, shopping at Goodwill and cutting their own hair. The coworkers are snooty, talking about expensive purchases and looking down on the author's choices. When asked about their own haircut, the author makes a joke about $45 being part of their food budget. The coworkers took offense, felt judged, and now are mocking the author.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was appropriate. The initial comment about $45 was in response to the coworker's snide remark. The author's intention was to point out the income disparity humorously. But the coworkers felt embarrassed or judged. The key here is whether the author crossed a line by making the comment in a way that was unkind or confrontational.\n\nThe coworkers were already showing disdain for the author's lifestyle. The author's retort could be seen as defending their own choices and highlighting the hypocrisy of the coworkers. However, using humor that references someone's wealth (like Nelson Rockefeller) might be seen as sarcastic or mocking. But the context is that the author was responding to prior snobbery. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers might not have expected the author to bring up their own financial constraints in such a direct way. The author's comment might have made the coworker feel called out, even if it was meant as a joke. However, the coworkers had already been making comments about the author's outfits, so there was a pattern of judgment. \n\nThe author was trying to be polite at first, but when the coworker made a snide comment, the author's response was a reaction to that. It's a back-and-forth where both sides might have contributed. However, the author's final comment was a joke, not a direct accusation. The coworkers took it as judgment, but maybe that's because they were sensitive about their own spending habits.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered unkind to point out someone's wealth in a way that makes them feel defensive. However, in this case, the author was responding to prior comments and tried to use humor. The coworkers reacted negatively, but the author might not be in the wrong because they were defending their own situation. However, the method might have been inappropriate. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have chosen a different response that didn't involve directly calling out the cost. Maybe a simple \"I find it too expensive, so I do it myself\" without the joke. The joke might have been the issue here. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were reacting to a snobbish comment. However, the way they chose to respond might have been a bit much. But considering the context of the coworkers' prior behavior, the author's reaction is understandable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here.\n"
