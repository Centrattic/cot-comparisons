I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and some snooty coworkers. The main incident was the author making a comment about a $45 haircut costing as much as their weekly food budget, which led to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author works at a small tech company, earns an okay salary for their area, but can't afford luxuries. Their coworkers are snooty, often discussing shopping and fancy meals. The author responds to their comments about haircuts by comparing the cost to their own food budget. The coworkers felt embarrassed and the author is now being excluded or mocked.\n\nThe key points here are about intent and the impact of the comment. The author says they weren't trying to be an asshole but were shocked by the price. However, the comment could come off as making a judgment about the other person's spending habits. Even if it was meant as a joke, it might have been perceived as mocking her for spending $45 on a haircut. The coworkers felt judged, which is a valid reaction. \n\nIn workplace dynamics, humor can be tricky. What one person sees as a joke, another might see as a jab. The author's response, while perhaps meant to highlight their own financial constraints, might have been interpreted as belittling the coworker's standard of living. The coworkers' reaction suggests that the author crossed a line, especially since it led to exclusion and sarcastic remarks about contributing to the farewell card.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were just being honest and didn't mean to sound judgmental. However, the effect of the comment is what matters here. The coworkers felt embarrassed, and the author's response in the moment (using a joke about their budget) might have been inappropriate given the context of the snooty interactions. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers' behavior in discussing shopping and making comments about the author's clothes first sets a tone of comparison and judgment. The author's comment was a reaction to that. But even so, responding with a comparison that highlights income disparity in a public or semi-public setting can be seen as provocative, even if not intended to be hurtful.\n\nSo, considering both sides, while the coworkers started the dynamic of comparison, the author's response did escalate the situation. The comment about the food budget might have been the catalyst for the coworkers' negative reaction. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility here. However, the coworkers' subsequent behavior in excluding and mocking the author also reflects poorly on them. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author's comment led to the coworker feeling judged and resulted in exclusion, and the author could have responded differently (e.g., just stating their situation without the joke), it's likely that the author is at least partially responsible. So, the answer would lean towards yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
