I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author reacting to a coworker's comment about a $45 haircut by joking about their food budget. The coworkers took offense, and there's some back and forth about whether the author was being judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author works at a tech company as front desk, has a modest lifestyle. The snooty coworkers are bragging about their shopping and meals. The author responds to a coworker's comment about a $45 haircut with a joke comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller and mentioning their food budget. The coworkers felt embarrassed and later mocked the author in the farewell card context.\n\nNow, considering intentions. The author says they weren't trying to be an asshole and thought they were joking. But the coworkers took it as judgmental. The main issue is whether the author's comment crossed a line by highlighting income disparity in a way that made others feel judged.\n\nThe author's response was a direct comparison of their own financial situation to the coworker's expense. Even if it was meant as a joke, the coworkers found it hurtful. The use of \"Nelson Rockefeller\" is a bit of a strong metaphor, implying that $45 is a lot for them. The coworker's reaction suggests that the author's comment made her feel like her spending was being criticized.\n\nAlso, the subsequent behavior of the coworkers, like excluding the author from the farewell card contribution, shows that the dynamic became tense after the comment. The author's comment might have been a slip-up, but it's important to consider the workplace environment. The author might be in a different socioeconomic bracket, and the comment inadvertently called attention to that, making others defensive or feel judged.\n\nHowever, the author didn't make a direct attack. They were responding to a comment from the coworker who first mentioned the $45 price. The author's response was to highlight their own budget constraints. The question is whether this was an appropriate way to handle the situation. While the intention wasn't to be mean, the impact was negative. In a professional setting, even jokes can be misinterpreted, so the author might have been careless with their words.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers might have been insensitive by making snide remarks about the author's thrift store clothes earlier. The author's comment could be seen as a reaction to ongoing snobbery. But the key is whether the author's response was appropriate. Even if the coworkers were snooty, responding with a joke that highlights the income disparity might not be the best approach. It can come off as passive-aggressive and could escalate tensions.\n\nSo, the author is partially at fault for not considering how their words might be received. While the coworkers were being snooty, the author's response crossed a line by using the coworker's financial habits as a point of comparison in a way that could be seen as judgmental. The author's comment about their own food budget was meant as a joke, but it's a sensitive topic and can easily be taken the wrong way. The coworkers' reactions indicate that the author did cause offense, so even if the intention wasn't malicious, the impact was negative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong to some extent.\n"
