I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a workplace situation involving income disparity and snooty coworkers. The author, a front desk person, makes a comment about the cost of a $45 haircut compared to their own budget. The coworkers reacted negatively, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they have a modest lifestyle and that $45 is a significant portion of their weekly food budget. The coworkers are from a higher income bracket and often brag about their purchases. The author's comment was made in a joking manner, but it was taken the wrong way by the coworker. \n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author didn't intend to be judgmental but was highlighting the disparity in their own way. However, the coworker felt judged, which led to her sharing the comment with others. The author's response of comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller might have come off as defensive or dismissive, even if it was meant as a joke. \n\nIn a workplace setting, even if the comment was a joke, it's important to be mindful of how others might perceive it. The author's colleague was sensitive to the comment, which made her feel embarrassed. The snide remarks from the coworkers after the farewell card incident show that the tension escalated. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. While the author's intent wasn't malicious, the impact of the comment affected a coworker's feelings. The author's response could have been more tactful. Making a joke about someone's spending, even in a light-hearted way, can be seen as judgmental in a workplace where income disparities exist. \n\nHowever, the coworker's reaction seems overblown, as a $45 haircut isn't that excessive, but the author's comment about their own budget might have made her feel self-conscious. The author's follow-up comment about the food budget and weight could have been a bit much, even if it was a joke. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't entirely at fault for the coworkers' snobbery, the way they addressed the disparity did contribute to the negative reaction. The author could have handled it more diplomatically to avoid making the coworker feel judged. So, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) for creating the situation by making a joke that was perceived as judgmental, even if unintended."
