I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and how they responded to a coworker.\n\nFirst, the author works at a tech company as front desk. They have a modest lifestyle, while some coworkers are more affluent. The coworkers often talk about shopping and expensive things. The author mentions their own modest spending, like getting haircuts from salons, and uses a joke about Nelson Rockefeller when a coworker mentions $45 for a haircut. The coworker felt judged and embarrassed. Now the coworkers are excluding the author in a subtle way with the farewell card comment.\n\nI need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points are the initial joke and the subsequent fallout. The author's intention was to make a joke, but the coworker took it as judgment. Even if the author didn't mean to, the comment might have been hurtful. The coworkers' reactions (tight-lipped smiles, snickering) suggest that there was some judgment involved. However, the author's response was a reaction to the coworker's own comments about price. But the author's remark could be seen as pointing out the disparity in a way that's not respectful.\n\nThe coworker felt judged, which is a valid feeling. The author's joke about the food budget might have been insensitive, even if it was meant to be light-hearted. In a workplace, making comments about others' spending can create tension, and the author's response was a direct comparison that could be seen as mocking the coworker's perspective. The coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author, which is also unprofessional.\n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not considering how their comment could be received. While the coworker's comments were snooty, the author's response could have been more tactful. The situation shows that both sides have contributed to the tension, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's action led to the coworker feeling judged, even if unintentionally, the author might share some responsibility. However, if the coworker was already judgmental, the author's comment was a reaction to that. But in professional settings, it's important to avoid comments that can be perceived as judgmental, regardless of intent. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the author's response was a valid defense against the coworker's snobbery, maybe B. But given the outcome, the author's joke crossed a line. So, leaning towards A.\n"
