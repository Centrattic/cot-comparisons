I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) when they commented on their coworker's $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author works at a small tech company and is a front desk person. They have a modest income and live a simple lifestyle. Some coworkers are described as \"snooty,\" who spend on fancy things like salons and designer clothes and sometimes make polite but condescending comments about the author's thrift store outfits.\n\nThe key incident is when the author's coworker asked about their haircut, the author mentioned cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker responds with the $45 price, and the author quips about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker was offended, and the author ended up being excluded in a social context (the farewell card comment).\n\nSo, the question is whether the author crossed a line. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author's response was in reaction to the coworker's snooty comment about $45 being cheap for a haircut. The author's comment about the food budget could be seen as highlighting the income disparity. However, the coworker felt judged, which led to further tension.\n\nFrom a workplace etiquette perspective, even if the author felt the coworker was being judgmental, responding with a comment about their own budget might come off as mocking or confrontational. The coworker's comment about $45 isn't just about the price but possibly a subtle way of showing off their ability to afford such things. The author's response could be seen as pointing out their own financial limitations, which might be perceived as a jab at the coworker's wealth.\n\nHowever, the coworkers were already making snide remarks about the author's thrift store clothes, so there's a reciprocal dynamic here. The author's response was a direct but maybe a bit sarcastic way of highlighting the disparity. But in a workplace, even if there's prior tension, using a comment that could be seen as mocking someone's spending habits might not be the best approach. The coworker's reaction suggests that the author's comment crossed into making them feel embarrassed or judged, which could be valid if the author's intention was to highlight their own lower income to contrast with the coworker's.\n\nBut then again, the author wasn't malicious; they thought it was a joke. The coworkers interpreted it as judgment, leading to exclusion. The key is whether the author's actions were inappropriate. The answer often in AITA scenarios hinges on whether the action was meant to be harmful or if it was a misstep despite good intentions.\n\nIn this case, the author's response might not have been intended to be mean, but it did cause the coworker to feel judged. The follow-up actions by the coworkers (excluding the author from contributing to the card) show that their relationship is strained, possibly because the author's comment made the coworker feel vulnerable about her spending.\n\nSo, depending on perspective, the author might not be the asshole because they were reacting to prior snobbery. However, the workplace isn't the best place for such exchanges, and the author's comment, while perhaps not malicious, could have been more tactful. The coworkers' reaction is valid if they felt judged, even if that wasn't the author's intent. The author's response might have been a bit too direct, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their comment contributed to a tense work environment, even if their intent wasn't to be mean.\n"
