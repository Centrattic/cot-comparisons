I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and a comment about a $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company as front desk. They have a modest income and lifestyle. Their coworkers are described as \"snooty,\" shopping at fancy stores and bragging about their purchases. The author responds politely but feels slighted when their thrift store outfits are met with condescension.\n\nThe key incident is when a coworker asks about a $45 salon, and the author jokes about it being their food budget. The coworker takes offense, and others spread the comment, leading to a passive-aggressive remark about the farewell card. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the comment was made in a light-hearted, humorous way. The author was pointing out the income disparity, which they found surprising. However, the coworkers reacted defensively, interpreting it as judgment. The author's intention was to make a joke, not to embarrass. But maybe the timing or delivery was off, especially if the coworkers are sensitive about their spending.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers started the dynamic by bragging and making condescending comments. The author's response was a natural reaction to being judged. However, the author did bring up their own financial situation in a way that could be seen as highlighting the disparity, which the coworkers found uncomfortable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about how actions affect others. Even if the author's intention was to joke, the coworkers felt judged. The workplace environment can become tense if such comments are made. The author might have crossed a line by making a joke that directly referenced their own financial constraints in a way that could be seen as passive-aggressive or judgmental of the coworker's spending.\n\nAlso, the coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author from the farewell card, which shows a power imbalance. But the initial comment from the author might have started that chain. So while the coworkers are at fault for their snobbery, the author's comment did escalate the situation. The author should have perhaps addressed the income disparity more privately or avoided making a public joke that could be misinterpreted.\n\nTherefore, the author might be partially at fault for not considering how their joke could be received, especially in a workplace where such topics can be sensitive. But the coworkers' behavior was also problematic. However, in AITA terms, the person who made the comment that immediately caused the conflict is often considered the asshole. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but there are nuances.\n"
