I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and the way they responded to their coworker. So, the author works at a small tech company as front desk. They mention making an okay salary but not enough for fancy stuff. They have a simple lifestyle, camping, relaxing weekends. The coworkers they're talking about are some women who are snooty, showing off their shopping and fancy meals. The author responds politely, but when asked about their haircut, they make a joke about $45 being their weekly food budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworkers were already showing off their wealth through their purchases and comments. The author's comment was a reaction to the idea that a $45 haircut is normal. They used humor to highlight the income difference. But the coworkers took it as an insult. The key points are whether the author's response was appropriate or if they crossed a line.\n\nThe author's intention was to point out the disparity, but maybe they did it in a way that was dismissive or mocking. Saying \"$45 is my food budget\" could be seen as comparing their own financial reality to the coworker's, which might come off as judgmental. Even if they didn't mean it that way, the coworkers felt judged. The follow-up comment about the food budget was probably meant as a joke, but the coworkers took it as an insult, leading to exclusion in the farewell card incident. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The coworkers might have been snooty and making the author uncomfortable, but the author's response was in a public work setting. Making a joke about someone's spending could be seen as unprofessional or offensive, especially if it leads to them feeling judged. The coworker's reaction of a tight-lipped smile and the subsequent exclusion suggest that the author's comment was not well-received and maybe crossed a line. \n\nHowever, the author was responding to what they perceive as snobbery. They weren't attacking the coworker personally but pointing out the contrast. The humor might have been inappropriate, but the root issue is the income disparity and the coworkers' behavior. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, since the coworkers felt judged and it led to exclusion, the author's response might have been the trigger. \n\nSo, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because their comment could be seen as judgmental and they escalated a situation that was already tense. Even if the coworkers were snooty, the author's response in a professional setting might have been inappropriate.\n"
