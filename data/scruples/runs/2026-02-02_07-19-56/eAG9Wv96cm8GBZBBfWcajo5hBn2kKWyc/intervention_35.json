I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about income disparity and a comment made about a $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author works front desk at a small tech company, has a modest income, and lives simply. The coworkers are snooty, talking about shopping and fancy meals. The author comments on the $45 haircut by comparing it to Nelson Rockefeller and mentioning their food budget. The coworkers took it as an insult, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points here are the comparison to Nelson Rockefeller and the mention of the food budget. The author might have thought it was a joke, but the coworkers felt judged. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author was defending their own financial situation and perhaps pointing out the disparity in a humorous way. However, the comment could come off as mocking the coworker's expense or implying that spending $45 on a haircut is excessive. The coworkers might have felt belittled by the comparison to a wealthy person like Rockefeller and the joke about food budget.\n\nIn workplace dynamics, comments about money can be sensitive. Even if made in jest, they can lead to feelings of judgment. The author might not have intended to insult, but the impact on the coworker matters. The coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author from the farewell card contribution, which adds to the tension.\n\nSo, the author's intention was likely not malicious, but the impact was harmful. The author didn't consider how the comment might be perceived by someone with a different income level. The coworkers took it as an attack, leading to embarrassment and exclusion. In such cases, even if the intention is neutral, the harm done makes the author partially at fault.\n\nHowever, the coworkers' reactions might be overblown, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's comment led to the coworker feeling judged and then exclusion, the author's words were inappropriate. They should have been more mindful of how the comment could be received, even if it was meant as a joke.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because their comment, while not malicious, contributed to a negative workplace environment by making a coworker feel judged. The answer would be A.\n"
