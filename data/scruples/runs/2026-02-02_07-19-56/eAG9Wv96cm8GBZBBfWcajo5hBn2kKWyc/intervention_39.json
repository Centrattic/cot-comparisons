I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is working at a tech company and is the front desk. They have a modest income and spend accordingly. Their coworkers are snooty and talk about their shopping and fancy meals. The author responds to a comment about their budget by comparing it to the salon price, which led to some embarrassment.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about income disparity and how the author addressed it. The coworkers were showing off their spending, and the author felt that pointing out the disparity was a way to highlight their different financial situations. But the coworker felt judged when the author made a joke about $45 being their weekly food budget. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Well, the author's response was a bit of a jab, even if it was in jest. When the coworker mentioned a $45 haircut, the author's reaction was to compare it to their own budget, which might have come off as mocking. Even if the author wasn't trying to be mean, the comment could be seen as making the coworker feel self-conscious about their spending. Also, the coworkers then retaliated by excluding the author in a kind of snide way. \n\nBut the author was reacting to being judged when they mentioned cutting their own hair. The coworker's comment about $45 being cheap might have made the author feel defensive. The author's response was a bit of a flip on the situation, but maybe crossed the line. \n\nIn workplace settings, it's important to maintain professionalism. Even if there's a disparity in income, making jokes that could be interpreted as sarcastic or judgmental might not be the best approach. The author's intention might have been to show that they have a different spending priority, but it led to embarrassment and a hostile response from the coworkers. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for responding with a sarcastic comment that turned the situation into a judgmental exchange. The coworkers felt they were being judged, and the author's reaction escalated the situation. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
