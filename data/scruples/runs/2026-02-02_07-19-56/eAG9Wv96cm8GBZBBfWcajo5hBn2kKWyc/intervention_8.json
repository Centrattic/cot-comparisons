I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author making a comment about a coworker's $45 haircut, referencing Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker felt embarrassed, and others later mocked the author. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author's actions were inappropriate. The author was being asked about their own hair cutting and responded with a joke about the $45 cost. The coworker's comment about the haircut being worth it might have been a setup for the author's response. The author's reaction was to make a joke about the cost being a week's food budget, which could be seen as mocking the coworker's spending habits.\n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the comment and the impact. The author claims they were just joking and didn't mean to be an asshole. However, the coworker felt judged, and others took it as a joke at her expense. The author's comment might have been trying to highlight the income disparity, but in a way that could be perceived as belittling the coworker's choice. \n\nIn a work environment, even if the intent is light-hearted, comments about someone's spending can be sensitive. The coworkers already had a pattern of being snooty, but the author's response escalated the situation by directly referencing the cost in a way that made the coworker feel embarrassed. The follow-up from other coworkers (including the comment about not making the author pay for the farewell card) shows that the dynamic became adversarial, which the author's initial comment may have caused.\n\nEven if the author didn't intend to be rude, the response was taken as judgmental. It's important to consider that in a workplace, such comments can create a hostile environment or make others feel uncomfortable. The author's use of a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and the food budget might have crossed a line by implying that the coworker's expense was frivolous, especially if the author was making a point about their own financial constraints.\n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, the impact of their words led to the coworker feeling judged and others mocking the author. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their comment was inappropriate in the context, even if it was meant as a joke.\n"
