I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they work at a small tech company as the front desk person. They have a modest income and lifestyle. The other female coworkers are described as snooty, shopping at fancy places and bragging about their purchases. The author responds to them by mentioning they get clothes from Goodwill and cut their own hair because they can't afford $45 haircuts. The key moment is when the author says, \"$45 is my food budget for the week,\" which leads to the other woman feeling judged and the coworkers snickering.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions were inappropriate. The author was reacting to the coworker's comment about $45 being worth it for a haircut. The author's response was a joke, using humor to highlight the income disparity. But the coworker didn't find it funny and felt embarrassed. The coworkers then mocked the author in return.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't mean to be judgmental, but their comment could be seen as pointing out the disparity in a way that might make others uncomfortable. Even if it was a joke, it's possible that the coworkers took it seriously. The author's response was in reaction to being snubbed and perhaps trying to deflect the judgment by turning the situation around. However, humor can be a double-edged sword in the workplace, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like income or spending habits.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were already engaging in behavior that could be seen as snobby, and the author was just pointing out the reality of their financial situation. The author's comment might have been a way to level the playing field or to express their own financial constraints. But in doing so, they might have overstepped by making a joke about someone else's spending, which could come off as judgmental.\n\nThe coworkers' reaction suggests that they felt the author was mocking their spending habits. Even if the author didn't intend it that way, the effect was that the coworker felt embarrassed. In professional settings, it's important to be mindful of how our words affect others, even in jest. The author's comment, while a reaction to the coworkers' behavior, might have crossed the line by publicly highlighting the income disparity in a way that could be perceived as belittling.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's intention was likely to respond to the judgment they were facing, but the method might have been inappropriate. The humor used could have been seen as retaliatory or dismissive, leading to the coworkers' negative reaction. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their response, even if not malicious, contributed to a tense work environment and was not well-received.\n"
