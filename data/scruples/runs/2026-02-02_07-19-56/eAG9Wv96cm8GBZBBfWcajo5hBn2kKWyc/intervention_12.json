I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author works at a small tech company as a front desk person. They mention their income is okay for their lifestyle, which is pretty modest. They don't have money for fancy vacations or clothes, but that's not really a problem for them. The main issue is with some snooty coworkers who go shopping at expensive places like Nordstrom and brag about their purchases. The author is polite when asked about their outfits, mentioning places like Goodwill, but the coworkers give them that judgmental smile. \n\nThen there's the specific incident where a coworker asks about the author's haircut. The author says they cut their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker responds with a snort and mentions $45 being worth it. The author then says, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" and later compares that to their weekly food budget. The coworker took offense, and others later mocked the author by saying they'd contribute to the farewell card so they don't have to cut into their \"food budget.\" The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author's comments were inappropriate. On one hand, the coworkers were already showing their disdain for the author's more modest spending and shopping habits. The author's comments were in response to a situation where they felt the coworker was judging them for not spending $45 on a haircut. The author was probably trying to highlight the income disparity and maybe even mock the idea that $45 is cheap. However, the coworkers took it as the author judging them, leading to backlash.\n\nI think the key here is about how the message was delivered. The author made a sarcastic comment that might have been intended as a joke, but it could easily be perceived as offensive or mocking. Even if the coworker was being snobbish, the author's response might have come off as condescending or making a joke about their own financial situation in a way that could be seen as belittling the coworker's. The coworker felt judged, which is a red flag. \n\nAlso, in a workplace, it's important to maintain professionalism and avoid comments that could create tension. The author's remark about the food budget might have been meant to show the disparity, but it could also be seen as using their own financial situation to imply that the coworker's spending is frivolous or that the author is more virtuous for not spending that money. That could be taken as a form of judgment. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were already being judgmental and condescending towards the author. The author's response was a reaction to being judged, so it's understandable they might push back. However, the way they did it might have been unprofessional. The author could have addressed the situation differently, perhaps by not making the sarcastic comment and instead just stating their position without the snark. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for responding to perceived judgment, but their method of response could have been better. However, in terms of workplace conduct, making a comment that's perceived as mocking someone else's spending habits, even in the context of their own financial constraints, can lead to issues. The coworkers' reaction suggests that the comment crossed a line. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for making a remark that, while perhaps not malicious, was taken as offensive and unprofessional.\n"
