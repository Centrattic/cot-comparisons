I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity between the author and some of their snooty coworkers. The author works at a tech company's front desk, has a modest income, and lives a simple lifestyle. The coworkers are described as snooty, often talking about their shopping and fancy meals, and giving polite but condescending reactions when the author mentions buying clothes from Goodwill.\n\nThe key incident happened when a coworker asked the author about their haircut. The coworker seemed surprised to learn the author cuts their own hair because they find salons too expensive. The author then jokes about $45 being their weekly food budget, which leads to the coworker feeling judged. The coworker and others later mock the author, implying they were being judgmental.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to point out the income disparity in a humorous way. The coworkers were already condescending, but the author's response might have escalated things. The author's intention was probably to deflect the judgment and maybe show that their financial situation is different, but it came across as mocking the coworker's expense. \n\nThe coworker felt judged, and the author's comment about $45 being part of their food budget could be seen as implying that $45 for a haircut is excessive. However, the author was just trying to make a joke, not to be offensive. On the other hand, the coworkers were already making comments about the author's outfit, creating a tense environment. \n\nBut in professional settings, even jokes can be misinterpreted. The author might have overstepped by using a sarcastic comment that highlighted the income difference, especially when the coworker was already being condescending. The coworkers' reaction suggests that the author's remark was taken as an insult. \n\nHowever, the coworkers' behavior was also problematic. They were the ones making snide remarks first. The author was responding to their condescension. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the way they responded could have been handled more tactfully. Instead of making a joke about their own budget, they might have just explained their situation without comparing it directly. \n\nThe coworkers then took it further by mocking the author in the break room, which is unprofessional. But the initial comment from the author might have been the catalyst. So, there's a mix of both parties' actions. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, if someone is being condescending, it's okay to set boundaries, but the method matters. Using humor can be a way to do that, but if it's taken the wrong way, it can backfire. The author's joke was a bit direct in pointing out the financial difference, which might not be the best approach in a workplace setting. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might have a point in feeling that the coworkers were being snobbish first, but their response could have been more professional. The coworker's reaction indicates that the author's comment was perceived as judgmental, even if that wasn't the intent. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the situation. \n\nBut the coworkers were the ones starting the condescending behavior. However, the author's response escalated it. Maybe the answer is that the author is partially at fault, but the coworkers were also wrong. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be yes, but with nuance. But according to the options, it's either A or B. The AITA subreddit often considers the person wrong if their actions, even if defensive, lead to conflict. So, the answer might lean towards A, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
