I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author works at a tech company as a front desk person. They mention that they have a modest income and live a simple lifestyle. The main issue is with some of their coworkers who are snooty, going to fancy places and bragging. The author responds to a comment about a $45 haircut by comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller, making a joke about their own budget. The coworker took offense, and others joined in, being snarky about it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The author's coworkers seem to be showing off their wealth and making the author feel like they're not part of their social circle. The author's response was a joke about the expense, using humor to highlight the income disparity. But the coworkers took it as an insult or judgment.\n\nIs the author wrong for pointing out the disparity? Well, they weren't trying to be mean, just making a joke. However, in a workplace, even jokes can be misinterpreted. The coworker might have felt embarrassed or judged by the comment. The author's intention was to be humorous, but the effect was hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's reaction seems a bit hypersensitive. The author is just stating a fact about their own budget. Maybe the problem is that the author's comment drew attention to their own financial situation in a way that was uncomfortable for the other person. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was inconsiderate. The author was probably trying to deflect the snootiness, but their approach might have been inappropriate. In a professional setting, it's important to maintain respect and avoid making others feel inferior. The author's joke could have been seen as mocking, even if it wasn't intended. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might have overstepped by making a comment that highlighted the income gap in a way that embarrassed the coworker. Even though the coworker was being snobbish, the author's response might have contributed to a hostile environment. Therefore, the author could be at least partially at fault here.\n"
