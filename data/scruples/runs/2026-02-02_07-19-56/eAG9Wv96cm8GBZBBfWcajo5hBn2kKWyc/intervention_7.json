I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about income disparity and how the author reacted to a colleague's comment about a $45 haircut. \n\nFirst, the author works at a front desk in a small tech company. They mention they have a modest lifestyle, don't need fancy things, and prefer activities like camping over shopping. The snooty coworkers go to fancy places and sometimes make polite but snobbish comments when the author mentions buying clothes from Goodwill.\n\nThen there's the incident where the coworker asks about the haircut, and the author responds with a joke about $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker and others reacted negatively, saying the author embarrassed them and made them feel judged. The coworkers later included a sarcastic comment about the author's food budget when contributing to a farewell card.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole here. The user thinks the author is at fault, but wants confirmation.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about how the author responded to the comment. The author's intention was to make a joke, but the coworkers took it as an insult. The author's comment compared their own budget to the $45 haircut, implying that $45 is a lot for them. But the coworkers felt judged. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, maybe they didn't mean to be judgmental, but the way they framed the response could be seen as pointing out their own financial struggles in a way that highlights the disparity. The author's comment might have come off as mocking the coworker's spending habits, even if it was a joke. \n\nIn a workplace, even if there's some snobbery from others, responding with a joke that highlights income differences can be sensitive. It's possible that the author did overstep by using their own financial situation as a punchline, especially when it's in response to someone else's comment. The coworkers might have felt that the author was making them feel bad about their spending, even if that wasn't the intention. \n\nAlso, the coworkers' reaction of including a sarcastic comment in the farewell card suggests that the author's response had lasting negative effects. Maybe the author should have handled the situation more carefully, perhaps with a different response that doesn't draw attention to the income difference in a potentially hurtful way. \n\nBut then again, the coworkers were already being snooty, so maybe the author was just pushing back. However, the way they did it might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. Even if the intention wasn't to be mean, the impact matters. The coworkers felt embarrassed and judged, so the author might have a responsibility to apologize and find a better way to handle future interactions.\n"
