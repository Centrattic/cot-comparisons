I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author pointing out the income disparity with their snooty coworkers. \n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company as a front desk person. They mention that their income isn't enough for luxury items but they don't really want those things. The snooty coworkers go shopping at fancy stores and brag about their purchases. When asked about their own outfits, the author mentions buying from Goodwill and gets polite but dismissive reactions.\n\nThe main incident is when a coworker asks about a salon, and the author reveals they cut their own hair. The coworker mentions $45 as a reasonable cost, and the author responds with a joke implying that $45 is a lot for them. The coworker then feels judged, and others comment on the author's behavior. The coworkers later mock the author by referencing the food budget joke during a farewell card contribution.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether drawing attention to income disparity is justified. The author's intention was likely to make a light-hearted comment, not to judge. However, the coworkers took offense, feeling that the author was criticizing their spending. The author didn't confront the coworkers directly but responded in a way that highlighted their own financial situation in a public context. \n\nIn workplace dynamics, comments about income or spending can be sensitive. Even if the author's intent was to be humorous, the effect was that the coworker felt embarrassed. The key here is whether the author crossed a line by using the coworker's comment about $45 as a way to point out their own financial limitations. The coworker might have felt that the author was mocking their spending habits, which could be seen as unprofessional or rude, especially in a workplace where such topics aren't common.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was responding to a situation where they were already being judged for their own choices (Goodwill clothes). The response could be seen as self-defense, pointing out the disparity without malice. However, the workplace isn't always the best place for such discussions, and even if the author's intent was to be honest, the way it was delivered might have been inappropriate. The coworkers' reaction suggests that they felt judged, which could mean the author's comment was perceived as critical, even if it wasn't intended that way.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because their comment was a reaction to being asked a question and making a light-hearted remark about their own budget. However, it's possible that they could have handled it more tactfully. The answer hinges on whether the comment was a direct judgment or just an honest, albeit potentially awkward, response. Since the author's intent was to be humorous and not to belittle, maybe they're not the asshole. But the coworkers felt judged, which complicates things. It's a bit of a grey area. But leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were sharing their own situation in response to the coworker's comment, even if it led to unintended feelings of judgment.\n"
