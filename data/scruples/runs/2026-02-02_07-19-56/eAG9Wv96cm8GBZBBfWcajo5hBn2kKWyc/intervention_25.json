I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author works at a small tech company and is the front desk person. They mention that their income is okay for where they live, but not enough for fancy things. They have coworkers who are snooty, often talking about their shopping and meals. The author responds politely but gets a bit of a snobbish reaction when mentioning where they get their clothes.\n\nThe key incident is when the coworker asks about the author's haircut. The author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker says $45 is cheap, and the author responds with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker then feels judged, and others in the workplace start excluding the author, like not letting them contribute to a farewell card.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, should the answer be A or B?\n\nFirst, let's analyze the situation. The author was in a conversation where the coworker was discussing a $45 haircut. The author's reaction was to compare that to their weekly food budget, which is meant to highlight the income disparity. The coworker felt judged, and the author's comment might come off as passive-aggressive or mocking, even if it was intended as a joke.\n\nIn workplace settings, it's important to be mindful of how comments can be perceived. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be judgmental, the comment could be seen as pointing out their own financial situation in a way that makes the coworker uncomfortable. The coworker might feel that the author is criticizing their spending habits, which can be a sensitive topic.\n\nThe author might argue that they were just making a lighthearted remark, but the response from the coworker and others indicates that it wasn't well-received. The exclusion from the farewell card contribution suggests that the author's comment caused tension. In such cases, maintaining professionalism and avoiding topics that could lead to discomfort is advisable.\n\nHowever, the author wasn't directly accusing the coworker of anything. They were reacting to a comment about the cost of a haircut, which was a topic the coworker initiated. The author's response was a personal comparison, which is a common way to express one's own situation. But in this context, the coworkers with higher income might perceive it as a jab, even if it's not intended as such.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's comment crossed the line from a personal observation into mocking or judgment. The phrase \"I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" is a bit sarcastic and could be seen as mocking the idea of spending $45 on hair. This sarcasm, even if intended as humor, might be the point where the author overstepped.\n\nConsidering all that, while the author might not have malicious intent, the comment did contribute to a situation where the coworker felt judged, leading to exclusion. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because their comment, though possibly not evil, was insensitive in the context and led to negative consequences. So, the answer would be A.\n"
