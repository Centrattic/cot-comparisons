I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and some snooty coworkers.\n\nSo, the author is a front desk person making okay money for their area but not enough for fancy stuff. They live simply. The coworkers are more upscale, shopping at high-end stores and eating out, and they sometimes make polite but snobbish comments when the author mentions buying clothes from Goodwill. \n\nThe key incident was when a coworker asked about the author's haircut. The author mentioned cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker said $45 is \"so worth it.\" The author then made a joke comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller and mentioned that $45 is their weekly food budget, leading to the coworker feeling judged and others snickering.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here. \n\nFirst, the author was responding to the coworker's comment about the value of a $45 haircut. The author's response was a joke highlighting their own financial constraints compared to the coworker's. The coworkers took offense, feeling judged. The author didn't mean to be offensive, but their comment might have come off as pointing out the income disparity in a way that embarrassed the coworker.\n\nIn these situations, it's important to consider intent versus impact. The author's intent was probably just to make a lighthearted comment about their own budgeting, but the impact was that the coworker felt judged for their spending. The coworkers are in a higher income bracket and might be sensitive about their own spending habits when confronted with a lower-income colleague's reality.\n\nHowever, the author didn't explicitly criticize the coworker's choice; they just highlighted their own financial situation. But the way it was phrased, comparing their budget to the coworker's standard of living, could be seen as drawing attention to the disparity, which the coworkers found uncomfortable. \n\nThe snooty coworkers might have been the ones being judgmental first, but the author's response escalated the situation. While the author's comment was a joke, it addressed a sensitive topic in a workplace where there's already tension. The coworkers took it as a judgment, so even if it wasn't the author's intention, the result was negative. \n\nIn professional settings, it's generally advised to avoid comments that highlight economic differences, as they can create tension. The author might not be entirely wrong, but they did contribute to the conflict. The coworkers' reaction is also questionable because they were already making snobbish remarks. However, the author's joke might have crossed a line by making the coworker feel embarrassed.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be partially at fault for not anticipating how the comment would be received, but it's a nuanced situation. However, since the coworker felt judged and the author's comment directly pointed out their own financial constraints in a way that could be seen as a critique of the coworker's spending, it's possible the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit torn because the coworkers were also snobby first. But in the context of the question about the author's wrongdoing, the answer is likely A.\n"
