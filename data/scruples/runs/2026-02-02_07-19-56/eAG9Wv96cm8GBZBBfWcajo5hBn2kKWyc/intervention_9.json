I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and social interactions at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a front desk person with a modest income, living a simple lifestyle. Some female coworkers are described as snooty, engaging in activities like shopping at expensive stores and talking about fancy meals. The author tries to be polite but feels judged when mentioning shopping from Goodwill. \n\nThe inciting incident is when the author comments on a $45 haircut being too expensive for them, referencing Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker felt embarrassed and later, the coworkers excluded the author by paying for their part of a farewell card, mocking their comment. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to assess if the author's actions were inappropriate.\n\nThe author made a joke about their budget, which might have been a bit confrontational. However, the coworkers were already judgmental. The author's comment was in response to the coworker's dismissive attitude towards a $45 haircut. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nIn workplace interactions, even if there's a power dynamic, making a sarcastic comment can come off as confrontational. However, the coworkers had been snooty and judgmental first. The author's intent wasn't to judge but to highlight the income disparity. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable defense against perceived judgment or if it was an unprofessional escalation. The author's comment could be seen as a humorous way to express their financial reality, but in a professional setting, it might have crossed a line, especially if it led to the coworker feeling criticized.\n\nBut the coworkers' reaction seems more about their own discomfort with being called out on their spending habits. The author's comment might have been a legitimate response to their snobbery, but the tone or context could have been a problem. \n\nIn many cases, AITA threads resolve with the person being the asshole for escalating a situation that could have been handled more diplomatically. However, if the coworkers were already creating a hostile environment, the author's response might be more about self-defense. \n\nThe author's comment was a direct but perhaps blunt way to point out the income disparity. While it's true that $45 is a significant amount for some, the way it was phrased could have been seen as mocking the coworker's spending habits. However, the coworker's own judgmental behavior might have provoked the response.\n\nI think the author isn't the asshole here. They were responding to a situation where they were being judged for their financial choices. The coworkers' reaction seems more about their own defensiveness than the author's intent. The author's comment, while maybe a bit sharp, was in the context of a conversation where the coworker was already being dismissive. The real issue is the snooty coworkers' behavior, not the author's response. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
