I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and how the author reacted to a coworker's comment about a $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company and is the front desk person. They mention making an okay salary but not enough for luxuries like vacations or fancy clothes. They live modestly. The snooty coworkers go shopping and brag about their purchases, making polite but condescending remarks about the author's thrift store outfits. The author usually handles this with politeness, not minding the comments.\n\nThen there's the incident where a coworker asks about a salon. The author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker responds with a snort and mentions $45 being worth it. The author then makes a joke, comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller and mentioning $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker gets upset, feeling judged, and other coworkers mock the author, implying they shouldn't have to spend that much. The author is now questioning if they were the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author responded with a sarcastic comment, which the coworker took as judgment. The author intended to make a joke but it backfired. The coworkers then made a snide comment about the author's contribution to the farewell card. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nFrom a social dynamics perspective, the author's response was a direct comparison between their budget and the coworker's $45 haircut. The comment about Nelson Rockefeller (\"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\") is sarcastic and highlights the income difference. The author's follow-up about the food budget being $45 could be seen as defensive or mocking, even if they thought it was a joke.\n\nHowever, the coworker's initial reaction (snorting, implying $45 is cheap) was condescending. The author's response might have been a way to push back against that. But in a workplace, especially with colleagues who are already snooty, making a sarcastic comment about their spending versus their own budget could come across as confrontational or judgmental. Even if the author didn't mean to judge, the coworker felt judged, leading to tension.\n\nThe coworkers then reacted by excluding the author in the farewell card contribution, which escalated the situation. The author's initial reaction might have been a misstep in how they handled the income disparity. While the coworkers were being elitist, the author's response may have been too direct and sarcastic, not considering how it would be received. In professional settings, it's important to maintain a certain level of decorum, and jokes about income differences can be sensitive. The author's comment, even if meant as a joke, could have been seen as highlighting their own financial struggles in a way that embarrassed the coworker or made her feel defensive. Thus, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the social dynamics and how their words could be interpreted, even if the intention wasn't malicious. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But maybe not entirely, since the coworkers were already being snobbish. However, the author's response did contribute to the conflict, so they might share some responsibility.\n"
