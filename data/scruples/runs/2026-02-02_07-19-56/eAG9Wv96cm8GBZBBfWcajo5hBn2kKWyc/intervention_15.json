I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about income disparity and a comment made at work. The author works as a front desk person, makes okay money for their lifestyle but can't afford luxuries. The coworkers are snooty, often show off their shopping and meals. The author responds to a comment about a $45 haircut with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworkers took offense, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the interactions. The author's intention was probably to make a joke, not to be judgmental. However, the coworkers interpreted it as offensive. The key point is whether the author overstepped by highlighting the income disparity in a public setting. \n\nIn the workplace, discussions about money can be sensitive. Even if the comment was a joke, it might have been unprofessional. The coworker felt judged, which is a valid feeling. The author's response was a direct comparison between their budget and the coworker's salon expense. While the author didn't intend to hurt feelings, the impact was there. \n\nThe coworkers' reaction of snickering and exclusion (like not letting the author contribute to the farewell card) shows they were upset. The author's actions led to a breakdown in workplace relations. Even if the comment was in jest, it's important to consider how it's received. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" \n\nIn this scenario, while the author's intention was light-hearted, the effect was hurtful. The author's response could be seen as passive-aggressive, drawing attention to their own financial situation in a way that could embarrass the coworker. Professional settings require tact, so the author's approach might not have been appropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their comment, though perhaps not malicious, contributed to a hostile work environment. Alternatively, if the coworkers were already snooty and making the author feel disrespected, the author's response might be a reaction to that. But the key is whether the author's action was wrong. The line between a joke and a jab is thin here. Since the coworker felt judged and it led to exclusion, the author's actions were unprofessional, hence in the wrong.\n"
