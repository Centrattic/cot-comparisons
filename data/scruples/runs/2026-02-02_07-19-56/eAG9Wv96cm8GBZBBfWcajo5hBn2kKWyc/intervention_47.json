I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author making a comment about the cost of a haircut compared to their own budget, which led to some tension with snooty coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author works at a small tech company and has a modest income, which fits their lifestyle. They mention not being able to afford vacations or fancy things. The coworkers in question are described as \"snooty,\" who shop at high-end stores and brag about their purchases. The author tries to be polite but gets snubbed when mentioning they buy clothes from Goodwill.\n\nThen there's the incident with the coworker asking about haircuts. The author mentions they cut their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker comments on the price, and the author responds with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their own budget. The coworker didn't find it funny, and it led to the coworkers excluding the author and making sarcastic remarks.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Did the author overstep? The author was reacting to what they perceive as the coworker's snobbery. They made a joke to highlight the income disparity but perhaps in a way that was confrontational. The coworkers felt judged, which is valid because the author's comment could be seen as pointing out their wealth in a mocking way. Even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the response might have been perceived as such. \n\nIn workplace interactions, especially with people who might already be sensitive to social dynamics, jokes about money can backfire. The author's comment about $45 being their weekly food budget could come off as implying the coworker is wasteful or that the author is more frugal to the point of necessity. Even if it's a joke, it might not be appropriate in that context. \n\nThe coworkers' reaction suggests they felt embarrassed or belittled. The author's intention might have been to make a light-hearted comment, but the result was creating tension. The follow-up comment from a coworker about contributing on the author's behalf further indicates that the initial interaction was seen as an attack on the coworker's spending habits.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might have crossed a line by using a joke to highlight their own financial situation in a way that others found offensive. Even if the author didn't intend to judge, the method of drawing attention to the disparity through a sarcastic remark could be seen as inconsiderate in the workplace. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
