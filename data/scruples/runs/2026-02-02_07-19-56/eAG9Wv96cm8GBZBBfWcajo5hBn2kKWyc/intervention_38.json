I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity between the author, a front desk worker, and their snooty coworkers. The key incident is when the author responds to a coworker's comment about a $45 haircut by joking about it being their weekly food budget, leading to the coworker feeling judged and subsequent mockery.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author mentions they have a modest income and a simple lifestyle. The coworkers, on the other hand, frequently spend money on shopping and dining, which they flaunt. The author's reaction to the $45 comment seems to be pointing out the disparity, which the coworkers took as an insult. The author's intent was to make a joke, perhaps highlighting the income gap, but the coworkers felt judged and took it personally.\n\nNow, considering social dynamics in the workplace. The author's remark, while possibly intended as a lighthearted comment, can be seen as a direct comparison between their budget and the coworker's spending. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the response could have been perceived as judgmental. The coworkers' subsequent actions (mocking the author and excluding them) suggest that the joke didn't land well and may have crossed a line.\n\nHowever, the coworkers also have their own behavior to consider. They were already making snide comments about the author's clothing and lifestyle, which the author handled politely. The author's response might have been a reaction to the ongoing dynamic of judgment from the coworkers. But in a professional setting, even if there's a history of snobbery, the author's choice of words might have escalated the situation. Making a joke about someone else's spending habits, especially when it's tied to their income, can be sensitive. The $45 comment directly contrasts the author's financial situation with the coworker's, which could be seen as pointing out their wealth in a way that's hurtful.\n\nAlso, the coworkers' reactions afterward, like the farewell card comment, indicate that the author's joke was taken as an affront. The author's response might have been a form of passive-aggressive retaliation, which isn't the healthiest approach in a workplace. While the coworkers started the dynamic of judgment, the author's response might have been an overreaction that led to further conflict. In professional environments, it's generally advisable to avoid making remarks about others' spending or income, as it can lead to tension and hurt feelings regardless of intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they were just being honest about their financial situation, and the coworkers' sensitivity is unwarranted. But the key here is how the message was delivered. Joking about someone else's expenses, even if it's a comparison, can be seen as mocking their choices. The author's comment could imply that spending $45 on a haircut is excessive when others can't afford it, leading the coworker to feel judged for their spending habits. \n\nIn conclusion, while the coworkers were indeed snobby and the author was trying to highlight the income disparity, the way they did it might have been inappropriate. The author's statement could be seen as a direct jab, which led to the coworker feeling embarrassed. Even if the author didn't intend to be an asshole, the result was that the coworker felt judged, and the author's remark contributed to that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they made a comment that, regardless of intent, hurt their coworker's feelings and exacerbated the already tense situation.\n"
