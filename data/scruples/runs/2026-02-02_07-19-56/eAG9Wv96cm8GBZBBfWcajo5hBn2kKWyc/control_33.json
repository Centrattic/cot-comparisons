I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and the author's response to a coworker's comment about a $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company as a front desk person. They live a simple lifestyle, don't spend on luxury items, and have a modest budget. The snooty coworkers often talk about their expensive shopping and meals, which the author politely acknowledges but doesn't engage in.\n\nThe key incident is when a coworker asks about the author's self-cut hair. The author responds with a joke comparing the $45 haircut cost to their food budget, using a reference to Nelson Rockefeller (a very wealthy person) to highlight the disparity. The coworker takes offense, and others later mock the author by referencing the \"food budget\" comment in a negative way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nLooking at the author's intent: They weren't trying to be malicious. The joke was meant to be lighthearted, as they mention laughing because they thought it was a joke. However, the coworker didn't find it funny and perceived it as an insult or judgment. The author's comment implied that $45 is a large amount for them, which could come off as pointing out their own financial limitations versus the coworker's, possibly making the coworker feel judged.\n\nBut then again, the coworker had already made a dismissive comment about \"some people,\" which could imply that the author's response was a reaction to being belittled. The author's joke might have been a defense mechanism against perceived snobbery. However, in a professional setting, even if the coworker was snarky, the author's response could be seen as unprofessional because it highlights income disparity in a public way, which might create tension. \n\nAlso, the coworkers later took the comment and used it to mock the author, which complicates the situation. The author's comment might have inadvertently escalated the situation, and in a workplace, maintaining professionalism is important regardless of the coworkers' behavior. Even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the comment could be interpreted that way, especially in a context where the coworker already felt superior. \n\nHowever, the coworker had previously made a snobbish remark (\"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"), which the author was responding to. The author's joke was a direct response to that comment, so it might be seen as a reciprocal jab rather than an outright judgment.\n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, while it's not ideal to make jokes about finances, the author's comment was a reaction to the coworker's perceived snobbery. The coworkers then took it further by mocking the author, which might indicate that the snooty coworkers were the ones being unprofessional.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author crossed a line. Since they made a joke that was intended to be humorous but ended up causing offense, they might share some responsibility. However, given the context of the coworker's earlier snobbery, it's a bit of a two-way street. The author's response wasn't malicious, but they did bring up income disparity in a way that could be seen as unprofessional. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers' reaction and subsequent mockery suggest that they were more in the wrong. But the user is asking if the author is the asshole. Considering the author's intent wasn't harmful, but the comment might have been unwise, the answer could be split. However, in professional settings, even if provoked, making a joke about financial status can be seen as unprofessional. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for how they responded, even if the coworkers were snobbish.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" The coworkers were snooty and made a comment that implied the author's budget is lower. The author's response was a joke pointing out that $45 is a significant amount for them. While it's possible that the author's comment could be seen as judgmental, the primary issue is that they responded in kind. However, the coworkers' reaction was exaggerated. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's comment was a reaction to the coworker's snobbery, but in a workplace, it's generally better to avoid such topics. The author's joke might have been inappropriate, but the context is that they were being snubbed. So it's a bit ambiguous. However, since the author's response led to further tension and was taken as an embarrassment, it's possible that the author overstepped, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, considering the coworkers' behavior, maybe the answer is B (not the author's fault).\n"
