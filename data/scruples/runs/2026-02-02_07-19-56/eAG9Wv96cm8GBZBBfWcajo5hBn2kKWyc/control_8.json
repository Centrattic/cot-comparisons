I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves them pointing out the income disparity with their snooty coworkers by making a joke about a $45 haircut compared to their food budget.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The author works at a small tech company as front desk staff. They have a modest lifestyle, don't spend on luxuries, and their coworkers are snobby, talking about shopping and fancy meals. The coworkers seem to look down on the author's thrift store outfits. \n\nThe key incident was when the author was asked about their own haircut, leading to a comment comparing $45 to their food budget. The coworker took offense, feeling judged, and others ganged up on the author, mocking them further. The question is whether the author was the asshole here.\n\nNow, to assess responsibility. The author's comment was a joke in response to the coworker's snide remark. They weren't trying to be mean but were shocked that a haircut was considered cheap. The coworkers, however, reacted negatively, feeling judged. But the author's comment was about their own budget, not directly criticizing the coworker's spending. \n\nHowever, even if the comment was a joke, it might have come off as defensive or implied that the coworker's spending was excessive. The coworkers then took it as judgment and retaliated, which is unprofessional. The author's intention wasn't to judge, but the statement could be perceived that way. The coworkers' response was harsh, but the author's comment might have been the catalyst. \n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, there's a line between discussing personal finances and making light of others' spending. The author's response, while perhaps a joke, did highlight a disparity and could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's perspective. However, the coworkers' reaction was also unprofessional, using sarcasm and exclusion. \n\nThe author's follow-up comment about using the $45 for hair instead of food budget was a joke, but it's possible that the coworkers felt belittled. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if their intention was to be self-deprecating, but they could have handled it better. However, given that the coworkers felt judged and the author's comment did draw attention to the income difference, there's a case to be made that the author overstepped, even if unintentionally. \n\nBut considering the coworkers were already snooty and the author was responding to their condescension, maybe the author is justified in calling out the hypocrisy. Still, in a professional setting, it's important to avoid such comparisons that can lead to tension. The answer hinges on whether the author's comment was a reasonable response to the coworker's attitude or if it crossed into being judgmental. \n\nBalancing both sides, the author might not be the asshole here because they were reacting to the coworkers' snobbery. However, the way they addressed it might have been inappropriate. But given the coworkers' subsequent behavior, it's possible the author isn't entirely at fault. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
