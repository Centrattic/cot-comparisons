I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author works at a small tech company as a front desk person. They mention that their coworkers, some of them, are snooty and often talk about their shopping and fancy meals. The author responds politely but feels the coworkers are snobbish when they comment on the author's thrift store outfits. \n\nThe key incident is when a coworker asks if the author knows a good salon, and the author reveals they cut their own hair to save money. The coworker comments on how $45 is a \"decent\" haircut, and the author retorts with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker took offense, and others started to exclude the author, making snide remarks about not wanting the author to have to cut into their food budget for a farewell card.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to make a joke, but the coworker felt judged. The author's comment about the $45 being their weekly food budget could be seen as a way to highlight the income disparity. However, the snarky tone might have come off as sarcastic or dismissive, even if that wasn't the intent. The coworkers' reaction suggests they felt embarrassed or judged by the author's comment. \n\nIn a workplace, even if there's a culture of casual conversation, making a joke about someone else's spending habits can be sensitive. The author's response was in the moment, but it's possible that they overstepped, especially if the coworker was genuinely hurt. The author might have thought it was a light-hearted exchange, but the impact was negative. The coworkers' subsequent exclusion of the author (like the farewell card comment) indicates that the author's joke was perceived as offensive, leading to tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was responding to a culture where their coworkers were openly discussing their purchases and spending, which the author found snooty. The author's comment was a direct response to being judged, perhaps as a way to assert their own values. However, in a professional setting, even if the coworkers are the ones starting the snobbery, the author's approach might not have been the best way to handle it. Instead of making a joke that could be interpreted as mocking or highlighting the disparity in a confrontational way, a more neutral response might have been better.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's intention might not have been malicious, but the impact was negative. In professional environments, it's important to be mindful of how comments are received. The author's joke could have been seen as a put-down, even if it wasn't meant to be. Therefore, the author might be at least partially responsible for the conflict that ensued. But whether they are entirely in the wrong is debatable. The coworkers were also contributing to a snobby environment, which might have provoked the author. However, the author's direct response escalated the situation. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a comment that came across as judgmental, even if unintentionally. Alternatively, it could be argued that the coworkers were the ones creating the problem, so the author is not the asshole. But given the outcome\u2014the coworker felt judged and the exclusion happened\u2014it's likely the author's joke crossed a line, so A might be the correct answer.\n"
