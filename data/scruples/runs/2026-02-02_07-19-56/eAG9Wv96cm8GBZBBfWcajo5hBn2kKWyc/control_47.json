I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about income disparity and a workplace interaction.\n\nFirst, the author is the front desk person at a tech company. They mention they make okay money, enough to live simply but not splurge. They have a modest lifestyle, camping on vacations, etc. The other women they work with are snooty, going to fancy places, talking about their purchases, and making polite but condescending comments about the author's thrift store clothes.\n\nThen there's the specific incident where a coworker asks about the author's haircut. The author explains they cut their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker states that a decent haircut is $45, and the author responds with \"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" implying that $45 is a lot for them. The coworker reacts negatively, and the author ends up being excluded in a way (others snicker when contributing to a card).\n\nThe author is wondering if they were the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to make a joke about their own financial situation, using humor to highlight the disparity. However, the coworker felt judged and embarrassed. The key here is whether the author's comment was inappropriate or crossed a line into making others feel bad. \n\nOn one hand, the author was being honest about their budget and using humor. They weren't directly attacking the coworker but pointing out the expense in a self-deprecating way. On the other hand, bringing up income differences in a workplace can be sensitive. Even if it's a joke, it might come across as comparing their own financial status to others, which can be seen as judgmental or drawing attention to the disparity. \n\nThe coworkers then took it as the author being judgmental. The author's comment about the food budget might have been the trigger. Even if it was meant as a joke, it's possible that the coworkers felt slighted, especially if they were already snooty and perhaps competitive about their lifestyles.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, they were reacting to the coworker's comment about $45 being worth it. The author's response was to point out that for them, that's a significant expense. It's a defense of their own spending choices. However, in a workplace, even casual comments can have consequences. The author might have overstepped by making a joke about it, especially when the coworker was already being snooty. \n\nThe aftermath shows that the coworkers took it personally and retaliated. The author's intention wasn't to be an asshole, but the effect was hurtful. The dilemma is whether the author should have realized that their comment could be perceived as judgmental, even if it wasn't intended that way. \n\nIn many cases, people's reactions are based on perception. If the coworker felt judged, even if the author didn't mean to, the author might still be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words could be received. Workplace interactions require a level of sensitivity, especially when it comes to personal finances. \n\nBut some might argue that the coworker was being snobbish and that the author was just calling out the absurdity of the expense. However, the key is whether the author's response was inappropriate. Making a joke in a situation like this is a gray area. \n\nI think the author's comment was a bit direct in highlighting the income gap, which might have been a mistake. Even if it was a joke, it could come off as mocking the coworker's standard of living. The fact that the coworker was snooty doesn't absolve the author of responsibility if their words caused hurt. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not gauging the situation correctly. \n\nTherefore, considering the workplace environment and the sensitivity around money, the author might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
