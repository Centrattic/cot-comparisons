I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author works at a small tech company as front desk. They mention that they have a modest income and a simple lifestyle, not spending on vacations, fancy food, or clothes. Meanwhile, some of the women coworkers are snooty, shopping at upscale places and bragging. The author responds politely but gets the \"cute\" reaction from them when mentioning thrift store clothes.\n\nThe key incident is when the author is asked about cutting their own hair instead of going to a salon. The coworker mentions a $45 haircut is worth it. The author then quips about Nelson Rockefeller and mentions $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker takes offense, and others start excluding the author, even mocking them in a group activity.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The author didn't set out to be mean but was reacting to what they perceived as snobbery. However, the comment about the budget could be seen as passive-aggressive. Even if the author didn't mean to judge, the response might have come off as belittling or sarcastic. The coworker felt judged, which led to her and others making snide remarks.\n\nIn workplace situations, especially when discussing income or spending, it's important to be mindful of how comments can be received. The author's joke about their budget in reference to a $45 haircut could be seen as highlighting economic disparity, which might not be appropriate in a professional setting. Even if the author didn't intend to embarrass the coworker, the effect was there. The coworker felt judged, and the author's response might have crossed a line by using a personal financial detail in a light-hearted way that others found offensive.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions led to exclusion and mockery from the coworkers, which is a negative outcome. While the coworkers are also being snooty and making comments about the author's clothes, the author's response escalated the situation. It's possible that the author's comment, though not malicious, was a direct jab at the coworker's spending habits, which could be seen as rude or unprofessional.\n\nSo, considering the impact of the author's actions and the resulting conflict, it might be that the author is at least partially at fault. However, the coworkers were also snobbish and contributed to a tense environment. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the direct action here is the author's comment leading to the coworker's discomfort. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
