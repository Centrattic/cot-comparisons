I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and a workplace interaction.\n\nSo, the main points are: The author is a front desk worker making okay money, but not enough for fancy things. Their coworkers are snooty, shopping at high-end stores and bragging. The author responds to a comment about a $45 haircut by comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller and making a joke about their food budget. The coworker felt judged and the author is now facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's response was inappropriate. The coworker made a snide comment about $45 being cheap for a haircut. The author's retort was a joke, but it might have been taken the wrong way. The key here is whether the author intended to judge or if they were just reacting to their own financial reality.\n\nThe author's comment was in response to the coworker's dismissive attitude. By bringing up their budget, the author might have been highlighting their different financial situations. However, in a workplace, even if there's animosity, it's important to avoid comments that could be seen as mocking or belittling. The author's reaction was a joke, but it crossed into potentially offensive territory by using sarcasm about someone's spending.\n\nAlso, the coworkers later took it as judgment, which the author might not have intended. The author's intent wasn't to be an asshole, but the effect was hurtful. The coworkers' response of excluding the author from the farewell card gesture shows how the comment affected their workplace relationships.\n\nIn workplaces, it's important to maintain professionalism. Even if the coworkers were snooty, retaliatory comments can escalate tensions. The author's joke could be seen as passive-aggressive, which isn't appropriate in a professional setting. They might not be the asshole, but they did contribute to the conflict by not handling the situation with more tact.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is partially at fault. They didn't intend to be mean, but their response was taken negatively and affected workplace dynamics. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
