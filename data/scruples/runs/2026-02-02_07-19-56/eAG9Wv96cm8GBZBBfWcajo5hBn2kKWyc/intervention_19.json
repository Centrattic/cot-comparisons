I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves some snooty coworkers and a comment made about a $45 haircut. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author works at a small tech company as front desk. They have a modest income and lifestyle. The coworkers they mention are wealthier, shopping at fancy stores and talking about their spending. The author handles these interactions politely but notices the disapproving reactions when they mention getting clothes from Goodwill.\n\nThe key incident is when the coworker asks about a $45 haircut. The author responds with a sarcastic comment comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller and then mentions the haircut being their weekly food budget. The coworker was offended, leading to the author being accused of embarrassing her and subsequent mockery in the workplace.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the perspectives. The author's intention was probably to make a joke, especially since they mentioned laughing and thinking it was a joke. However, the coworker didn't find it funny and felt judged. The author's comment could be seen as drawing attention to the income disparity in a way that made the coworker uncomfortable, even if it was meant as a joke. \n\nIn a workplace, especially with colleagues who may have different financial situations, making such a comparison can come off as insensitive. Even if the author didn't intend to be judgmental, the comment highlighted the economic gap and used sarcasm, which can be hurtful. The follow-up from the coworkers (mocking the author's contribution to the farewell card) suggests that the joke was taken the wrong way and caused tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers' behavior of showing off their wealth and making polite snubs about the author's thriftiness might have contributed to a tense environment. The author might have felt the need to defend their choices, but the way they did it\u2014publicly and with a joke that could be interpreted as belittling\u2014might have crossed a line.\n\nConsidering the principles of workplace etiquette and sensitivity, even if the author's intent was not malicious, the impact of their words was negative. They should have been aware that comparing someone's spending to their own financial constraints in a sarcastic manner could be perceived as judgmental. It's possible the author is in the wrong here because humor in such contexts can easily backfire, and they didn't consider how their comment might be received, especially given the existing dynamics between them and their coworkers.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their comment, while perhaps intended as a joke, contributed to a hostile work environment and was insensitive to the coworker's feelings.\n"
