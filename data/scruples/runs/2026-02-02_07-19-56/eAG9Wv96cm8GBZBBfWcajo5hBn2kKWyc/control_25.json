I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author works at a small tech company and is a front desk person. They have a modest income and live a simple lifestyle. Some of their female coworkers are snooty, going shopping at fancy places and bragging about their purchases. The author tries to be polite but feels the coworkers look down on them when they mention buying clothes from Goodwill.\n\nThe key incident is when a coworker asks about a haircut, the author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker responds that $45 is cheap, and the author says something like, \"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" and makes a joke about $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker felt embarrassed, and others later confronted the author, leading to some snide comments about contributing to a farewell card without the author's money.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author was trying to make a joke about the price of a haircut, which they can't afford. But the coworker took offense, feeling judged. The author's comment was meant to be light-hearted, but it came off as confrontational or dismissive. The coworkers' behavior is snooty and judgmental, but the author's response might have been a bit harsh or sarcastic, even if not intended to be mean. \n\nIn workplaces, especially with people who already have a tense dynamic, making comments about income disparities can be sensitive. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the disparity or just make a joke, the coworker interpreted it as judgment. The author might have crossed a line by bringing up their financial situation in a way that made someone feel uncomfortable. However, the coworkers were also being judgmental, so the author might have felt defensive.\n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's comment was a joke, but it's possible that in the context of the coworker's snooty attitude, the author felt the need to push back. However, the author's response did lead to the coworker feeling embarrassed, and the others then ganged up on the author. So, while the coworkers are in the wrong for being snooty, the author's joke might have been the catalyst for the conflict. \n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, it's generally advisable not to make comments that could be perceived as mocking or highlighting income differences, as it can create tension. The author's comment, even if a joke, did draw attention to the disparity, which the coworker found offensive. So, while the coworkers are judgmental, the author's response might have been inconsiderate, even if not malicious. \n\nTherefore, the author might be partially at fault for contributing to the conflict, but it's not entirely their fault. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be A (Yes) because their comment, though perhaps not intended to be hurtful, did cause offense and escalate the situation.\n"
