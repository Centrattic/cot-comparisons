I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about income disparity between the author and some snooty coworkers. The author is the front desk person in a small tech company, making enough for a simple lifestyle but nothing fancy. The coworkers often talk about their shopping and fancy meals, which the author politely listens to. When asked about cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive, the author responds with a joke about $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker didn't find it funny and now the author is feeling like they might have embarrassed her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't do anything with malice. They were reacting to a comment about $45 being a \"decent\" haircut. The author's response was a joke, possibly highlighting the income difference. The coworker took offense, feeling judged. The key here is intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to be judgmental, but their words made the coworker feel that way. \n\nIn social interactions, even if the intent is light-hearted, the impact can still hurt someone's feelings. The coworkers come from a higher income bracket, and the author's comment might have made them feel that their spending habits were being criticized. However, the author was just stating their own financial reality. The problem might be in the delivery or the context of the conversation. \n\nThe coworker's reaction was to talk about it with others, leading to a situation where other coworkers are now snickering and excluding the author from the farewell card contribution. This suggests that the author's comment was taken more seriously than intended. The question is whether the author crossed a line by bringing up their financial situation in a way that could be seen as judgmental or embarrassing to the coworker.\n\nOn one hand, the author was just explaining their own budget, not criticizing the coworker's spending. On the other hand, the joke might have been insensitive, especially in a workplace where there's already tension. The coworkers might feel that the author is trying to draw attention to the income disparity, which could create a hostile work environment. \n\nIn many workplace scenarios, it's important to be mindful of how comments about money can affect others. Even if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the delivery could have been interpreted that way. The coworkers might feel that the author is trying to make themselves look better by comparison, which is why they reacted negatively. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intention was not to be an asshole, but their words had a negative impact. The line between a joke and an insult can be thin, and in this case, the coworker took it the wrong way. Therefore, the author might have overstepped, even unintentionally, leading others to feel judged. Hence, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author was just being honest and the coworkers are overreacting. But given the context and the resulting actions (excluding them from the card), it's more likely that the author's comment, though not malicious, was inappropriate in this setting.\n"
