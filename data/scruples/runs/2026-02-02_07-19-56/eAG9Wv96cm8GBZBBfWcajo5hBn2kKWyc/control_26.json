I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation they described. The scenario involves the author pointing out the income disparity with their snooty coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author works at a small tech company as front desk. They mention they have a modest lifestyle, not buying fancy things but enjoying simple activities. The coworkers they're talking about are some women who are snooty, going to fancy places, bragging, and making polite comments about the author's thrift store clothes. \n\nThe key incident was when the author's coworker mentioned $45 for a haircut, and the author responded with a joke about Nelson Rockefeller and their food budget. The coworker took offense, leading to the coworkers excluding the author and making snide remarks about contributing to a farewell card. The author now feels confused if they messed up.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me break it down. The coworkers were already coming off as snooty and making comments about the author's finances. The author's response was a joke, but maybe it crossed a line. The coworker felt judged, so the author's comment might have been perceived as mocking the cost of the haircut. \n\nBut the author's intention was probably to highlight the disparity in their spending habits. However, the way they did it was in a playful manner, expecting humor. The coworkers took it seriously, leading to tension. \n\nIn these situations, it's important to consider intentions vs. impact. The author didn't mean to be offensive, but the impact was negative. Even if the coworkers were acting snooty, the author's response might have been an inconsiderate way to address it, especially in a workplace. The coworkers might have felt their financial choices were being criticized, which can be sensitive. \n\nBut then again, the coworkers were already making comments and showing their own snobbery. The author's reaction was a self-deprecating joke, pointing out the absurdity of $45 being cheap. However, using a colleague's expense as a joke about their own budget could be seen as passive-aggressive or dismissive. \n\nWorkplace dynamics matter. Even if the coworkers were snooty, the author's response might not be the best approach. It's possible that the coworkers were more sensitive about their spending, and the author's comment made them feel defensive. The aftermath, like excluding the author from the card contribution, shows that the coworkers are now retaliating, which is problematic, but the initial response might have set that off.\n\nBut the author wasn't trying to be mean; they were reacting to a situation where they felt they were being judged. The humor might have backfired. In such cases, it's often about how the message is delivered. The author's response was a joke, but in a professional setting, even jokes can be misinterpreted. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They were responding to a snobbish environment, and their intention wasn't to embarrass. However, the way they reacted might not have been the best approach. But the coworkers' reactions also seem petty and exclusionary. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is A (yes) if they are, B (no) if not. Considering that the author's response was a joke that led to the coworker feeling judged, even if unintended, the author might have overstepped. But since the coworkers were already being snooty, the author could argue it was a fair response. \n\nBut in professional settings, it's important to maintain boundaries. The author might have been defensive and used a joke that could be seen as mocking. The coworkers' reaction is part of the problem, but the author's action did contribute. However, if the coworkers were provoking, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's response was perhaps inconsiderate, but given the context of the coworkers' behavior, maybe they're not the asshole. The answer might be B (no). But I'm not sure. Let me check similar scenarios. Often, in AITA situations, if someone is being defensive or reactive to others' behavior, it's still on them if their response is unprofessional. The author's joke in a workplace setting could be seen as unprofessional, even if it was a reaction to snobbery. So maybe A. But the coworkers' behavior is also bad. \n\nAlternatively, since the author didn't intend to be judged, but the coworker felt that way, the author's response might have been inconsiderate. So the answer is A (author is wrong). Or maybe B, because the coworkers were being snooty. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (no), because the author was responding to an environment where they were already being judged and made fun of. The author's joke was a reaction to that, and while maybe not the best approach, it's not entirely their fault. The coworkers' overreaction and exclusion are also to blame. So the author isn't the asshole. But some might argue that they should have handled it differently. \n\nBut in AITA terms, if the author's action led to the coworker feeling judged, even unintentionally, the author is at fault. However, the coworkers were setting the tone. I'm torn. \n\nMaybe the answer is B because the author wasn't in the wrong; the coworkers' reaction is part of a pattern of snobbery. The author's comment was a self-deprecating joke, not a direct attack. So the author isn't the asshole. \n\nFinal answer: B.\n"
