I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their actions in the described situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author works at a small tech company as a front desk person. They have a modest income and lifestyle, not indulging in expensive things. However, some of their coworkers are snooty, spending money on fancy stores and restaurants, and making polite but condescending remarks about the author's thrift shopping. The key incident is when a coworker asks about the author cutting their own hair, leading to a comment about $45 being the author's food budget, which the coworker took as embarrassing and judgmental. The coworkers then mock the author by saying they'll cover their part of the farewell card to avoid them using their \"food budget.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response was appropriate. The author was reacting to a comment where the coworker implied that $45 is a normal and cheap price for a haircut. The author's retort was a joke pointing out that $45 is a lot for them, comparing it to a high-profile person like Rockefeller, and then mentioning it's their food budget. The coworkers took offense, feeling judged.\n\nThe author's intention was to point out the income disparity, which might have been a way to level the social dynamic. However, humor can be tricky. The question is whether the author crossed a line. The coworkers were already making snide remarks, so the author's response might be seen as a defense mechanism. However, using a joke about someone's spending habits, even in a context of income disparity, can come off as passive-aggressive or judgmental. The author's comment was meant to highlight the contrast but might have been perceived as mocking the coworker's expense.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. The coworkers were already being snooty, so the author might have felt targeted. But in a professional setting, it's important to maintain a certain level of decorum. Even if the coworkers were making the author uncomfortable, the author's response could be seen as unprofessional, especially if it led to backlash and a hostile environment.\n\nThe coworkers' reaction of going to the author and telling them they embarrassed someone suggests that the comment was hurtful. The author's intention might not have been to embarrass, but the effect was there. The author's comment about the food budget could be seen as highlighting their financial situation in a way that embarrassed the coworker, which might not be acceptable in a workplace where such topics are sensitive.\n\nHowever, the author was also a target of the coworkers' snobbery. The initial interactions were the coworkers making comments about the author's thrift shopping. The author's response could be seen as a justified reaction to being judged, but the method might not have been the best approach. Instead of a joke, perhaps addressing it more directly or setting boundaries without public humiliation would have been better.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. The author's intentions were to point out the disparity, but the method used might have been inappropriate. The coworkers' behavior was also snooty and potentially unkind, so the author might have felt justified. However, the author's comment could be seen as making the coworker feel bad about her spending, which is a personal choice. The author might have overstepped by using a joke that focused on the other person's expense as being out of their league, which can be seen as judgmental.\n\nAnother consideration is the workplace dynamic. The author is in a lower position (front desk) compared to the other coworkers, so there's a power dynamic. The author's comment might have been a way to assert themselves, but it's important to manage interactions professionally. The fallout, with coworkers excluding the author in a gesture of solidarity with the other coworker, shows that the author's actions did create a negative environment.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as unprofessional and contributing to a hostile work environment, even if they were reacting to snobbery. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance. However, since the coworkers were already being snooty, the author's response could be seen as a reaction to ongoing behavior. But the question is whether the author's action was wrong. The key is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author's comment was a joke, but it crossed into personal territory and could be seen as passive-aggressive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
