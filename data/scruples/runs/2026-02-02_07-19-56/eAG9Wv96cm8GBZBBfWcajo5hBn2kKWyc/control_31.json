I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author works at a small tech company and is the front desk person. They mention making okay money for their area but not enough for fancy things. Their coworkers, some of them, are snooty and talk about their shopping and fancy meals. The author responds by mentioning they shop at Goodwill and cut their own hair to save money.\n\nThe key moment is when a coworker asks about a $45 haircut, and the author retorts with \"What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\" and jokes about the $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker took offense, and others later confronted the author, leading to some snide remarks in the workplace.\n\nHmm. The author's intention was probably to make a joke about the high cost of a haircut relative to their own budget. But the coworker felt judged, and others took it as the author being snarky or judgmental. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author was reacting to what they perceived as the coworker's snobbery. They were trying to highlight the income disparity in a humorous way. But maybe they didn't consider how their comment could come across as dismissive or mocking. The coworker might have felt belittled, especially in a workplace setting where such comments can create tension.\n\nThe author's response could be seen as defending their own financial situation, but the way they phrased it might have been insensitive. The coworkers then took it further by excluding the author in a mocking way (contributing to the card without them). But the main question is about the initial interaction.\n\nIn workplace dynamics, even if there's underlying snobbery, responding with a comment that could be interpreted as sarcastic or judgmental can escalate the situation. The author's joke might have crossed a line, even if they didn't mean to be cruel. The coworker felt judged, and the author's reaction led to further conflict.\n\nSo, while the coworkers' behavior is also problematic, the author's response could be seen as contributing to the tension. They might have been the asshole in this situation because their comment, although a reaction to the coworker's attitude, was not constructive and led to hurt feelings. The answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, considering that the author was trying to make a point about income disparity and the coworker was already being judgmental, maybe it's a grey area. But since the author's comment was public and led to embarrassment, it's more likely they crossed the line. So, A.\n"
