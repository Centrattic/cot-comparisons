I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing up income disparity with snooty coworkers by making a comment about a $45 haircut.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author works at a small tech company as front desk. They have a modest income and lifestyle. Some coworkers are snooty, talking about fancy shopping and meals. When asked about a haircut, the author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker responds with $45 being the cost. The author then jokes about being Nelson Rockefeller and mentions $45 being their weekly food budget. The coworker felt judged and embarrassed, and others took it as a jab.\n\nThe author's defense is that they weren't trying to be an asshole and were shocked by the price. But the coworkers took offense. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider social dynamics. The coworkers are already coming off as judgmental (snooty), making comments about the author's clothes. The author is reacting to their comments, which might be a form of subtle class judgment. The author's response was a joke, but it's possible they overstepped. Making a comment that highlights the income disparity in a public setting (workplace) could be seen as bringing up a sensitive topic in a way that's not appropriate for the environment. Even if it's a joke, it can come across as mocking or belittling the coworker's perspective, especially if the coworker is being defensive about their own spending.\n\nWorkplace interactions require a degree of professionalism and sensitivity. While the author might feel they're being honest, the way they expressed it in a situation where there's already tension could be problematic. The coworkers felt that the author embarrassed them, leading to exclusion (like not putting the author's money into the farewell card). The author's response might have crossed the line from humor into insensitivity, even if unintended.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was responding to the coworker's own comment about the haircut price, which was part of the coworker's snooty behavior. The author might have felt provoked, but in a professional setting, even if provoked, it's important to avoid actions that could create discomfort or perceived judgment.\n\nThe key is whether the author's actions were unkind or dismissive. The joke about the food budget could imply that the coworker's expense is unnecessary, thus judging their spending. Even if the author didn't intend to, the coworker felt judged, and the workplace environment suffered. The author might have a point about the coworker's snootiness, but the way they responded wasn't appropriate for a professional setting. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for escalating the situation rather than addressing it in a way that maintains workplace harmony.\n"
