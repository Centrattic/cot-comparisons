I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves income disparity and a confrontation about a haircut cost.\n\nFirst, the author works at a small tech company as front desk. They live a modest lifestyle, shopping at Goodwill, and cutting their own hair. The snooty coworkers spend money on fancy things and sometimes make polite but condescending comments. When asked for a salon recommendation, the author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. They make a joke about $45 being their weekly food budget, comparing themselves to Nelson Rockefeller. The coworker takes offense, feeling judged, and later there's a snide comment about the farewell card payment.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's comment was a joke, but the coworkers took it as an insult. The author didn't intend to be judgmental, just to express surprise at the high cost. However, the coworkers felt embarrassed or judged. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nIn these situations, it's important to consider intent vs. impact. The author's intent was to make a humorous point about their own budget, perhaps highlighting the income disparity without malice. However, the coworkers perceived it as them judging the other's expense. The author's comment, while a joke, might have been taken the wrong way. They could have been more tactful. But were they in the wrong?\n\nThe coworkers made comments about the author's outfits before, so there's a history of snobbery. The author's reaction was to a snort and dismissive comment. Maybe they were pushing back. However, the author's response could have been more measured. Instead of making a joke about their budget, perhaps they could have changed the subject or not engaged. The coworker's sensitivity to being judged might be an issue too, but the author's comment was in response to being judged themselves.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment is often about whether the person's actions were reasonable given the context. The author's comment, while a joke, might have been a bit confrontational. It's possible they overreacted by comparing themselves to a wealthy figure. However, the coworkers' subsequent behavior (excluding them from the card, mocking them) seems like they escalated the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a joke that was taken the wrong way. But given the context of the coworkers being condescending, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their comment was inappropriate. Since they were defending their own budget and making a point about income disparity, but in a way that could be seen as mocking the other's spending. It's a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, if someone's comment leads another to feel judged, even if unintended, the speaker might be considered in the wrong for not anticipating the impact. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the coworkers had prior judgmental behavior. However, the author's response was a direct comparison that could be seen as belittling. So, leaning towards A.\n"
