I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about income disparity between the author (front desk person) and some snooty coworkers. The main conflict happens when the author comments on the cost of a haircut, which leads to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is making okay money for their lifestyle, but not enough for fancy things. The coworkers are bragging about their shopping and meals. When asked about a salon, the author mentions cutting their own hair because salons are too expensive. The coworker responds with $45 being worth it. The author then jokes about Nelson Rockefeller and the food budget, which the coworker took as an insult.\n\nThe key points here are about social dynamics and workplace interactions. The author's comment was a joke, but it came off as dismissive or mocking. The coworkers felt judged, which is a common issue when income differences are brought up in a way that others perceive as condescending.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to make that comment. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider if the author's response was justified. The author might have felt that the coworker was being pretentious, so they used humor to highlight the disparity. However, in a professional setting, making a joke that could be seen as belittling someone else's spending might be inappropriate. Even if the author didn't mean to judge, the coworker felt that way, and it affected the work environment. \n\nAlso, the coworkers' subsequent actions (excluding the author from the card and mocking them) show that the situation escalated. The author's comment might have been the catalyst. While the coworkers were snooty, the author's response crossed a line by making a joke that could be interpreted as mocking someone's financial choices. \n\nIn the workplace, maintaining a respectful environment is crucial. Even if income disparities exist, making a joke about someone else's spending can create tension. The author's intention might not have been to judge, but the effect was negative. Therefore, the author is somewhat at fault here.\n"
