      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant wife deciding not to breastfeed, and the husband calls her selfish. The user is asking if they're the AITA.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind because she wants her body back. The husband is suggesting she tries it anyway for health and cost reasons, but she refuses. He labels her as selfish, and now she's not discussing it.\n\nSo, the key points here are the wife's autonomy and the husband's response. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and even though there are health benefits, it's not a one-size-fits-all decision. The wife's reason for changing her mind is about her own body and autonomy, which is a valid concern. The husband's argument is about the baby's health and cost, which are practical points, but he's framing her decision as selfish, which can be hurtful.\n\nLabeling someone as selfish can be a strong and accusatory statement. It's possible that the husband is trying to express his concerns but using a term that's dismissive of his wife's perspective. The wife's decision is about her own priorities, which is understandable. The husband might not be considering the emotional and physical toll breastfeeding can take, or that her desire to reclaim her body after pregnancy is a legitimate reason.\n\nHowever, the husband's intention might be to advocate for the baby's health. But the way he's approaching it by calling her selfish could be damaging to their communication. It's important in relationships to respect each other's decisions even if there's disagreement. The fact that the wife isn't discussing it anymore suggests that the husband's approach has caused a rift.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not respecting her autonomy and using a derogatory label, that's problematic. The answer would lean towards AITA being the husband. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe he's just stressed about the baby's health. But the core issue is her body and her choice. So, the husband's accusation of selfishness is likely the issue here. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
