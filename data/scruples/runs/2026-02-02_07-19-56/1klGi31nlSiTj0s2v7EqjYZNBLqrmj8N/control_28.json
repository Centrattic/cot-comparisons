      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about calling his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is pregnant and changed her mind about breastfeeding, citing wanting her body back. The husband calls her selfish for prioritizing her body over the baby's health and cost. So, the question is whether the husband is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife's decision to not breastfeed is personal. Breastfeeding can be physically and emotionally challenging for many women. The husband is concerned about the baby's health and the cost, which are valid points, but he's framing her decision as selfish. The term \"selfish\" is a strong accusation and can be hurtful, especially when it's about a personal health decision. \n\nThe wife's reason for changing her mind is her own body and well-being. It's important to respect a person's autonomy over their own body. Even if the husband disagrees with her decision, calling her selfish might not be the right approach. It could make her feel attacked rather than listened to. \n\nAlso, the husband's suggestion to \"just try for a bit\" might not consider the complexities of breastfeeding. It's not as simple as trying for a short period; it requires commitment and can be difficult. If the wife is set against it now, pushing might not be effective. \n\nThe key here is communication and mutual respect. The husband's approach might have been dismissive of his wife's feelings and needs. Instead of labeling her as selfish, he should try to understand her reasons and find a solution that works for both of them. The wife's right to make decisions about her body is a significant factor here.\n\nSo, the husband's use of the term \"selfish\" could be seen as invalidating her decision and not respecting her autonomy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for that approach, even if his intentions are to do what's best for the baby. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the way he frames his wife's decision as selfish is disrespectful and doesn't consider her personal reasons.\n"
