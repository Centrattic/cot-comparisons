      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the man who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the wife should breastfeed or not. The wife changed her mind about breastfeeding because she wants her body back, and the husband thinks she's being selfish by not trying for the baby's health and cost. He called her selfish, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Breastfeeding is often encouraged because it's healthier and cheaper, but it's also a personal choice. The wife is pregnant and due soon, so her decision to not breastfeed might be based on her physical and emotional health. The husband's criticism might not be considering her reasons, which could be valid. \n\nSelfishness is a strong term. If the wife is prioritizing her own well-being, which is understandable, especially during pregnancy, then calling her selfish might be unfair. The husband's argument is about the baby's health and cost, but the wife's choice is about her autonomy. \n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. The husband tried to discuss it but was met with refusal. Using the term \"selfish\" could have made her feel attacked, leading to the breakdown in communication. Maybe the husband should have approached it more empathetically, understanding her perspective instead of labeling her as selfish.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's right to her own body. Even if the husband has concerns, he can't force her to breastfeed. Her decision is hers alone. The husband's frustration is valid, but the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the answer would depend on whether the husband's actions were reasonable. If he's dismissing her valid reasons and using a harsh label, he's in the wrong. If he's just trying to advocate for the baby's health but in a poor way, maybe not. But given that the wife's reasons are about her own body and the husband called her selfish, which is a judgmental term, it's more likely he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he criticized his wife for prioritizing her own needs, which is a valid personal choice, and used a derogatory term that likely caused harm and stopped communication. He should approach the issue with more empathy and respect for her autonomy.\n"
