      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is pregnant, due in a month. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind. She says she wants her body back for herself. The husband asked her to try breastfeeding for a bit because it's cheaper and healthier. She refused, and he called her selfish. Now they're not discussing it, and he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the wife's decision-making autonomy versus the husband's concerns about health and cost. Breastfeeding is often seen as beneficial, but it's not the only option. The wife is making a choice about her own body and health. The husband's comment that she's being selfish implies that her decision is self-centered, but she's prioritizing her own needs. \n\nIs the husband wrong for calling her selfish? Well, by labeling her decision as selfish, he might be invalidating her reasons. Every parent has different priorities. She might have valid reasons like physical discomfort, mental health, or personal time. The husband's approach could be dismissive of her autonomy. Even if he thinks breastfeeding is better, he should respect her choice without belittling her. \n\nAlso, communication is key here. He tried to reason with her, but calling her selfish might have shut down the conversation. The wife might feel that her needs aren't being considered. So, by using that term, he's possibly undermining their partnership. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is just concerned about the child's health and cost. But his approach might not be supportive. The answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her decision and is using a judgmental term. So answer A for yes.\n"
