She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for calling their pregnant wife selfish regarding her decision not to breastfeed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due soon. She had planned to breastfeed but changed her mind, citing wanting her body back. The husband suggested trying it for a bit because of health and cost benefits but she refused. He called her selfish, leading to a conflict.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice, and while there are health benefits, it's not always straightforward. The wife has the right to make medical decisions about her body. The husband's comment about selfishness could come off as dismissive of her autonomy and emotional state. Pregnant women often face pressure to meet certain expectations, and calling someone selfish in this situation might invalidate their feelings. \n\nHowever, the husband's concern about health and cost isn't entirely unfounded. But it's important to approach such discussions with empathy. The key here is whether the husband overstepped by labeling his wife's choice as selfish. Using such language can be hurtful and might prevent open communication. The wife's decision is her right, and the husband's approach might be the issue here.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author might be in the wrong for using a negative label that could harm their relationship and disregard her autonomy. The answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
