She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The person called his wife selfish because she changed her mind about breastfeeding. The wife is pregnant and originally planned to breastfeed but now doesn't want to try. She says she wants her body back. The husband suggested trying it for a bit, but she refused, and he called her selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and the mother's health and comfort are important. The wife might have valid reasons for changing her mind, like physical discomfort, mental health, or lifestyle factors. The husband's comment about her being selfish could come off as dismissive of her needs and autonomy. Even if he's concerned about the baby's health, using the term \"selfish\" might be hurtful and shut down communication. It's important to respect each other's decisions in a healthy relationship. So, the husband's approach might be the issue here. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he labeled her selfishly instead of supporting her choice.\n"
