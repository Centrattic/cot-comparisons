She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The wife is pregnant and changed her mind about breastfeeding. The husband thinks she's being selfish because she wants her body back for herself. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and the wife is making a decision about her own body, especially during pregnancy and postpartum. The husband is concerned about health and cost, which are valid points, but the way he approached it by calling her selfish might be problematic. \n\nSelfishness can be subjective. The wife's priority is her own well-being and reclaiming her body, which is a valid perspective. The husband's frustration is understandable, but labeling her as selfish could be dismissive of her feelings and autonomy. It's important to respect her decision, even if he disagrees. The fact that she's now unwilling to discuss it after being called selfish might indicate that his words hurt her, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn relationships, how we express disagreements matters a lot. Instead of using accusatory language, approaching the conversation with empathy and understanding might have been more effective. The husband's right to his opinion exists, but the delivery of that opinion might have been inappropriate, especially in a sensitive time like pregnancy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband's use of the term \"selfish\" could be seen as invalidating his wife's feelings and choices. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for the way he expressed his disagreement.\n"
