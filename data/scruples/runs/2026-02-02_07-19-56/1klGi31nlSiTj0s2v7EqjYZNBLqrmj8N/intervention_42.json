      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband called his wife selfish because she decided not to breastfeed their upcoming baby, even though she was planning to before. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. He wanted her to at least try breastfeeding for the health and cost benefits, but she refused, saying she wants her body back. Now she's not discussing it with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife made a sudden change in her decision about breastfeeding. The husband's argument is based on health and cost, which are valid points, but he called her selfish. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice and can be physically and emotionally demanding. The wife's decision could be influenced by her own well-being, especially after childbirth. The husband's response of labeling her as selfish might be dismissive of her feelings and autonomy. Even if the husband has valid concerns, the way he addressed it might be inappropriate. It's important to respect a partner's decisions, especially regarding their body and health. The key here is communication. Instead of calling her selfish, he might have approached it with empathy, understanding her reasons, and discussing alternatives. By using accusatory language, he may have shut down the conversation, which is counterproductive. The wife's right to make decisions about her body is significant here. So, the husband's reaction might be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful of her autonomy. Therefore, the answer is likely A (in the wrong).\n"
