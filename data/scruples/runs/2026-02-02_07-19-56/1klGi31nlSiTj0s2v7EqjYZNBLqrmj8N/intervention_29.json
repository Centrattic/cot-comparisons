      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for calling his wife selfish. The situation is that the wife changed her mind about breastfeeding, and the husband is upset because he thinks she's being selfish. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind, citing wanting her body back. The husband argues that breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper, so he asked her to try, but she refused. He called her selfish, and now she's not discussing it with him.\n\nIn terms of rights and responsibilities, the wife has autonomy over her own body. Even though breastfeeding has benefits, the decision to do so is ultimately hers. The husband's comment about her being selfish could be seen as invalidating her choice and her autonomy. Using terms like \"selfish\" might be hurtful and could shut down communication, which is important in a relationship, especially during a stressful time like pregnancy.\n\nThe key points here are bodily autonomy, respect for each other's decisions, and communication. The husband's approach might be seen as dismissive of his wife's needs and feelings. Even if he has valid points about health and cost, the way he expressed his disagreement (calling her selfish) was likely inappropriate. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, and pressuring someone about personal health choices can be counterproductive.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he disrespected his wife's autonomy and used a derogatory term that hurt their communication. It's important to acknowledge that while the husband has his perspective, the wife's decision is her own, and the way he reacted was not supportive.\n"
