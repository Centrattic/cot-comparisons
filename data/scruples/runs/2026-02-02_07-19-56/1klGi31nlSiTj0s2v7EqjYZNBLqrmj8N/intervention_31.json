      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife deciding not to breastfeed after being pregnant and due in a month. The husband thinks she's being selfish because he wants her to try breastfeeding for the health and cost benefits. The wife says she wants her body back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wife is pregnant, so her health and well-being are important. Breastfeeding can have health benefits for the baby, but it's a personal choice. The husband's concern is valid, but how he expressed it might be the issue. Calling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially when it's a personal decision.\n\nI remember that in many cases, decisions about parenting and the body are up to the parent. The mother's autonomy is crucial here. Even if the decision isn't what the partner wants, respecting her choice is important. The husband's approach of labeling her as selfish could have damaged the conversation. Maybe a better approach would be understanding her reasons and supporting her choice, even if he disagrees.\n\nAlso, cultural and societal pressures might play a role. There's often a lot of emphasis on breastfeeding without considering the mother's health and preferences. The wife's choice to prioritize her body is her right. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the way he reacted might be the problem. Instead of calling her selfish, he could have asked for her perspective and found a compromise, like combining breastfeeding with pumping or other options if possible.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the decision to breastfeed isn't the mother's sole burden. The partner can support in other ways. The husband's approach might not have considered the emotional and physical demands on his wife. The key issue here is the communication and respect for each other's needs. The husband's words were harsh, so he's likely in the wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
