      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling their pregnant wife selfish because she changed her mind about breastfeeding. The wife wants her body back for herself, and the author is upset because they thought breastfeeding was healthier and cheaper. The author called her selfish, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wife is pregnant and due soon, which is a significant time in a relationship. The author is concerned about the health and cost benefits of breastfeeding but respects her initial plan. However, she changed her mind because she wants her body back, which is a personal choice. The author's response was to label her as selfish, which the wife is now offended by.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal decision that involves the mother's health, comfort, and circumstances. Even though there are health benefits, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. The wife's reasons for not wanting to breastfeed might include physical discomfort, mental health considerations, or personal priorities. By calling her selfish, the author is dismissing her autonomy and prioritizing external advice over her well-being.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy. Instead of labeling her as selfish, he could have acknowledged her feelings and discussed alternatives, like formula feeding if that's her choice. The term \"selfish\" can be hurtful and belittling, especially in a sensitive time like pregnancy. It's important to respect each other's autonomy and work together as a team.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that his input is valid because of the health and cost factors. However, the wife has the right to make decisions about her own body, even if those decisions differ from what's generally recommended. The key issue here is the author's choice of words and the lack of support for his wife's decision.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's approach was likely the wrong one. Calling his wife selfish is dismissive and doesn't foster a constructive conversation. The right approach would involve mutual respect and support for each other's choices, even if they differ from expectations. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
