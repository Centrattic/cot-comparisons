      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife changed her mind about breastfeeding, and the husband called her selfish for not even trying. The question is whether the husband is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. Breastfeeding is generally recommended for health reasons, but it's not mandatory. The wife decided against it because she wants her body back for herself. The husband suggested trying it for a bit, citing cost and health benefits, but she refused. He called her selfish, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, the key points here are about autonomy and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife's decision to not breastfeed is a personal choice. While breastfeeding has benefits, it's ultimately her body and her decision. By calling her selfish, the husband is dismissing her valid reasons. Even if his intention was to encourage her, labelling her as selfish can be hurtful and might be seen as invalidating her feelings and choices. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's decisions, especially when they're about personal health and bodily autonomy. The husband's approach might have been confrontational, which can shut down communication. The wife's reason\u2014wanting her body back\u2014is a legitimate personal priority. The husband's criticism might not consider the emotional and physical aspects she's dealing with, especially nearing labor and delivery. \n\nSo, the husband's use of the term \"selfish\" could be seen as wrong because it's a judgmental label that doesn't account for her perspective. Even if he's trying to advocate for the baby's health, the manner in which he expressed his concern was disrespectful. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the husband being in the wrong.\n"
