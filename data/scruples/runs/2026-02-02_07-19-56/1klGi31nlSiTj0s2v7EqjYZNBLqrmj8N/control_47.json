      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is pregnant and decided not to breastfeed, even though she originally planned to. The husband thinks it's healthier and cheaper, but she wants her body back for herself. He called her selfish, and now she's not discussing it.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to consider both sides. The wife is making a personal choice about her body. Breastfeeding can be physically and emotionally demanding. She might have valid reasons for changing her mind, especially if she's prioritizing her own well-being. On the other hand, the husband is concerned about the baby's health and the cost. \n\nBut the key point here is the term \"selfish.\" Using that word could be hurtful. Even if there's a disagreement, labeling someone as selfish might not be helpful. It's important to respect each other's choices, especially regarding the mother's body and her health. The wife's decision to prioritize her own needs isn't necessarily selfish; it's a personal choice. The husband's approach might have been confrontational, leading to a breakdown in communication. \n\nSo, the husband might be in the wrong for using such a charged term without understanding her perspective. The answer is likely A, but I need to make sure. The question is whether he's wrong for calling her selfish. If the answer is A, then yes, he's wrong. B would be if he's not wrong. Given the context, using \"selfish\" was probably the mistake here. The right approach would be to support her decision even if they disagree on the health aspects, as it's her body. So I think the answer is A.\n"
