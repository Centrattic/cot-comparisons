She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for calling their wife selfish regarding her decision not to breastfeed. \n\nFirst, the wife is pregnant and due in a month. She initially planned to breastfeed but now refuses, citing she wants her body back. The husband suggests trying it for a bit because it's healthier and cheaper, but she refuses. He calls her selfish, and now they're not discussing it.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal factors. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and the mother's health and well-being are important. The husband's argument is pragmatic (healthier, cheaper), but the wife's decision is about her own autonomy. \n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful. Even if there's a disagreement, labeling a partner as selfish might be seen as dismissive of their feelings. The key is whether the husband's approach was respectful. He tried to reason, but using \"selfish\" might have shut down communication. \n\nThe wife's decision is valid. Mothers have the right to choose what's best for themselves, even if others disagree. The husband's intent might be to do what's best for the baby, but his method could be the issue. \n\nSo, the author's mistake is in the wording. Instead of respecting her choice and finding a compromise, he used a derogatory term that could harm their relationship. Even if his intention was good, the approach was flawed. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
