      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is at fault for calling their pregnant wife selfish when she decided not to breastfeed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind because she wants her body back. The husband suggested trying it for a bit since it's healthier and cheaper, but she refused. He called her selfish, and now she won't discuss it.\n\nBreastfeeding is often a personal choice and can involve various factors. The wife's decision might be influenced by her physical and emotional well-being. If she's feeling pressured, that could lead to tension. The husband's argument is about health and cost, but he frames her refusal as selfishness, which might be dismissive of her reasons.\n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially when they have their own valid reasons. The husband's intent was to persuade, but the choice of words (\"selfish\") could be seen as attacking her motives rather than discussing the issue constructively. Even if he's trying to do what's best for the baby, using such language might invalidate her feelings and decisions, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel he's advocating for the baby's health. However, the key here is whether his approach was respectful and collaborative. The wife's right to make decisions about her body is important. If he's not open to her reasons and instead labels her, that's problematic.\n\nSo, considering the use of a derogatory label without understanding her perspective, the answer would likely be that the husband is at fault. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
