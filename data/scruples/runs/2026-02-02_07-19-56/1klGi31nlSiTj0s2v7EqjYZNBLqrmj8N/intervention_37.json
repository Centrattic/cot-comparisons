She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband calling his pregnant wife selfish because she decided not to breastfeed. The wife originally planned to breastfeed but changed her mind, citing that she wants her body back. The husband is upset because he thinks breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper, and he called her selfish, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's argument is based on the health benefits and cost savings of breastfeeding. He's trying to encourage her to at least attempt it. The wife, however, is prioritizing her own physical and possibly emotional well-being by not breastfeeding, which she sees as reclaiming her body. \n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the husband's labeling his wife as selfish is appropriate. Selfishness is a strong term and can come off as dismissive of the other person's feelings and autonomy. The wife's decision not to breastfeed might have valid personal reasons that aren't immediately apparent. Maybe she has health issues, past trauma, or simply doesn't want to go through the discomfort. The husband's approach of calling her selfish could be seen as invalidating her feelings, which is a red flag in communication.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to approach disagreements with empathy and understanding. Using accusatory language like \"selfish\" can escalate conflicts and make the other person defensive. The husband might be trying to be reasonable by citing health and financial benefits, but the method of communication is problematic. The wife's right to make decisions about her own body is a significant factor here. Even if the husband disagrees, respecting her autonomy is crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to advocate for the baby's health, which is a valid concern. However, the way he's handling it might be the issue. Instead of labeling her, he could have discussed his concerns without attacking her character. The fact that she won't discuss it anymore suggests that his words hurt her, leading to a communication breakdown.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's use of the word \"selfish\" is likely the main problem here. It's more about how he communicated his concerns rather than the content of his argument. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't approach the situation with the necessary empathy and respect for his wife's autonomy.\n"
