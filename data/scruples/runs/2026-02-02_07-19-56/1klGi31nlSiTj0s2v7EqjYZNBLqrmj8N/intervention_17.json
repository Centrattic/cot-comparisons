She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the wife deciding not to breastfeed after previously planning to, and the husband calling her selfish for prioritizing her own body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due soon, which is a significant life change. Breastfeeding can be a personal choice influenced by various factors like health, comfort, and personal priorities. The husband's argument is about the baby's health and cost, but the wife's decision is about her body and autonomy.\n\nIn many societies, there's a push towards breastfeeding because of its health benefits, but it's important to respect individual choices. The husband's comment about her being selfish might come across as dismissive of her reasons. Even if he disagrees, labeling someone as selfish can be hurtful and close the door to discussion, which is what happened here.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, communication, and mutual respect. The wife's right to make decisions about her own body is a crucial factor. The husband's approach of calling her selfish might undermine her agency. While his intention might be to advocate for the baby's health, the method could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the husband's concern about health and cost isn't unfounded. But the way he expressed it could have been more empathetic. Instead of labeling her selfish, he could have explored her reasons further or suggested alternatives that both parties can agree on.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the husband's approach might be the issue here. The answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong for calling his wife selfish in this context.\n"
