      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation involves the wife changing her mind about breastfeeding because she wants her body back. The husband suggested trying it first, but she refused, leading him to call her selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The wife is pregnant and due soon. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind. Her reason is that she wants her body back for herself. The husband argues that breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper, so he asked her to at least try. When she refused, he labeled her selfish, and now there's a communication breakdown.\n\nSelfishness typically implies a lack of consideration for others' needs. In this case, the wife's decision is based on her own health and well-being. Postpartum is a critical time for a woman's physical and mental health. The husband might be focused on the baby's health and cost, but the wife is prioritizing her own needs. It's a balance between two valid perspectives.\n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially in a marriage where mutual respect is essential. The husband might not realize that his wife's decision isn't just about convenience but about her health. On the other hand, he's trying to advocate for the baby's best interests. However, using the term \"selfish\" dismisses her feelings and reasons, which can escalate conflict. \n\nThe wife's right to her own body is significant. Medical guidelines also emphasize that the decision to breastfeed should be a mutual choice between parents, respecting the mother's autonomy. The husband's approach might have been to understand her reasons better rather than label her actions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's use of the word \"selfish\" might be the issue here. It's possible he's in the wrong because he didn't consider her health and autonomy, and instead accused her of selfishness without understanding her perspective. The answer might be A, that he is in the wrong.\n"
