She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe husband's wife is pregnant and due soon. She had initially planned to breastfeed but decided not to try, citing that she wants her body back. The husband suggested she at least try because it's cheaper and healthier, but she refused. He called her selfish, and now she's not discussing it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The wife is making a personal health decision regarding her own body. Breastfeeding is generally recommended for health benefits, but it's not the only factor. The husband's concern is about cost and health, but he's calling her selfish for not wanting to breastfeed. \n\nSelfishness usually implies prioritizing one's own needs over others'. In this case, the wife is choosing her own comfort and autonomy, which is a valid personal choice. The husband is imposing his preferences on her health decisions. Even if breastfeeding is beneficial, it's a medical decision that should involve mutual respect. The husband's response of calling her selfish might be invalidating her reasons, which are personal and about her own well-being post-pregnancy.\n\nAlso, the wife's decision could have medical, emotional, or physical reasons that the husband isn't considering. By labeling her as selfish, he's dismissing her valid concerns. The fact that she's not discussing it anymore suggests that his approach has damaged the conversation.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the husband's wrong lies in not respecting her autonomy and using a derogatory term. Even if he has good intentions, the way he communicated them was disrespectful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
