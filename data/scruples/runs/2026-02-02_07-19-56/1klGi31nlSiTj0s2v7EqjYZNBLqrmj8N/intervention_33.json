She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling his pregnant wife selfish after she decided not to breastfeed. First, I need to consider the context. The wife changed her mind about breastfeeding, citing wanting her body back. The husband suggested trying it for a while, but she refused. He called her selfish, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, calling someone selfish can be harsh, especially in a relationship. But I should think about the reasons. The husband's concern is about the health and cost benefits of breastfeeding, which are valid points. However, the wife's decision is based on her own well-being and autonomy over her body. It's important to recognize that the decision to breastfeed is a personal one and can be influenced by various factors, including physical and emotional health.\n\nIn many cultures, there's a lot of pressure to breastfeed, sometimes leading to guilt-tripping. The husband's approach might have been dismissive of his wife's feelings. Even if his intentions are good, using the term \"selfish\" could come across as accusatory rather than understanding. It's possible that the husband didn't fully consider her reasons or the stress she might be under, especially during pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to advocate for what he believes is better for the baby. But the key here is communication. Instead of labeling her as selfish, he could have tried to understand her perspective better. The wife's right to make decisions about her own body is significant, and her choice should be respected even if it's different from what others expect.\n\nSo, the husband's mistake might be in how he communicated his concerns rather than the concerns themselves. It's possible he's not in the wrong entirely, but his approach was problematic. However, if the wife's decision is based on her health or personal choice, accusing her of selfishness undermines her autonomy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using that term and not supporting his wife's decision, even if he disagrees.\n"
