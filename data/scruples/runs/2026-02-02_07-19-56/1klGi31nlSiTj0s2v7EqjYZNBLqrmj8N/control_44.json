She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their pregnant wife selfish is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife changed her mind about breastfeeding, citing wanting her body back. The husband suggests trying it for a bit because it's healthier and cheaper. The wife refuses, and he calls her selfish. Now the wife isn't discussing it with him anymore. The husband is asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Breastfeeding is a personal choice and can involve various factors like health, personal preference, and physical comfort. The wife is in a vulnerable position, being pregnant and soon to give birth. Her decision to not breastfeed is her right, and she's expressing her needs. The husband's argument is about health and cost, but he's framing her decision as selfish, which can be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings and bodily autonomy.\n\nCalling someone selfish in a situation where they are making a personal choice about their body can be seen as invalidating. It's important to approach such decisions with empathy. The husband's approach might be seen as undermining his wife's autonomy, which is a significant issue in a relationship. While his intention might be to find the best for the baby, the way he expressed it could be damaging to their communication.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. He shouldn't have labeled his wife as selfish, which could have led to the breakdown in communication. Respecting her decision without using derogatory language is key here.\n"
