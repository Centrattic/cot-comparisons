She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is upset that his wife, who's pregnant and planning to give birth in a month, changed her mind about breastfeeding. She wants to stop trying because she wants her body back for herself. The husband called her selfish, and now she won't discuss it with him. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nThe user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. They want the answer to be A or B. Let me think about this.\n\nFrom a general perspective, parenting decisions can be personal and sensitive. The wife is making a choice about her body, which is a significant aspect of her health and autonomy. Breastfeeding can be physically demanding, and some women choose not to for various reasons, even if there are health benefits. The husband's frustration is understandable, especially considering the cost and health benefits for the baby. However, he's criticizing his wife's decision as selfish, which might be dismissive of her reasons. It's important to respect her autonomy and choices, even if they differ from what the other partner thinks is best.\n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful and might close the door to discussion. The husband's approach might have been too confrontational. The wife's reason for not breastfeeding\u2014wanting her body back\u2014could be valid for her, and respecting that is crucial. Even if the husband thinks it's better for the baby, it's her body, and the decision should be mutual but ultimately hers.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for calling his wife selfish and not respecting her decision. The answer would be A.\n"
