She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife is pregnant and decided not to breastfeed, and the husband called her selfish. The user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The wife is pregnant and is making a decision about breastfeeding. The husband is concerned about health and cost, but the wife wants her body back. He called her selfish, and now there's conflict.\n\nBreastfeeding can indeed have health benefits, but it's a personal choice. The wife's decision might be influenced by various factors like her health, previous experiences, or how she feels about her body post-pregnancy. The husband's argument is about health and cost, which are valid points, but he's framing her decision as selfish. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially if it's a personal medical choice. The wife is prioritizing her own well-being or autonomy, which is a legitimate reason. The husband's approach might be dismissive of her agency. Even if he has good intentions, the way he communicated his concerns might have been disrespectful. He should have discussed it more empathetically instead of labeling her as selfish. Therefore, the author (husband) is likely in the wrong.\n"
