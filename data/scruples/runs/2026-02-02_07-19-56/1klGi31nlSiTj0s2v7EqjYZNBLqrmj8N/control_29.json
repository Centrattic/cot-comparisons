      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife deciding not to breastfeed after initially planning to, and the husband calling her selfish. The husband argues that breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper, but the wife wants her body back for herself. The user wants to know if the husband is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. She changed her mind about breastfeeding. The husband is upset because he thinks she's being selfish. The key points here are the wife's autonomy over her body versus the husband's concerns about the baby's health and cost.\n\nBreastfeeding is often recommended for its health benefits, but it's not the only way to feed a baby. The wife has the right to make decisions about her own body, even if it goes against initial plans. The husband's argument is valid in terms of health and cost, but he's dismissing her personal reasons. Calling her selfish might be hurtful because it questions her selflessness as a parent.\n\nThe wife's decision to not breastfeed could be influenced by various factors like physical discomfort, mental health, or personal priorities. The husband's approach of labeling her selfish might be invalidating her feelings and not considering her perspective. Communication is key here, and the husband's method of expressing his concerns might have been confrontational rather than collaborative.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the husband is trying to advocate for what he believes is best for the baby. But the way he communicated his concerns (calling her selfish) could have been a major issue. The response should respect both parties' viewpoints but emphasize the importance of mutual respect and understanding in such decisions.\n\nIn many cases, decisions about parenting involve balancing different factors. While the husband has valid points about health and cost, the wife's autonomy and well-being are equally important. The husband's comment about selfishness might be the main issue here because it attacks her character rather than discussing the situation calmly.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the husband is in the wrong (A) because he disrespected his wife's autonomy and used a hurtful label, which is not a constructive way to address disagreements, especially in sensitive topics like parenting.\n"
