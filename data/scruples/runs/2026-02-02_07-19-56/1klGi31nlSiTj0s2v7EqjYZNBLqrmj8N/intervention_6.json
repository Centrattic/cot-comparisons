      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The wife is pregnant, planned to breastfeed, but changed her mind, citing wanting her body back. The husband suggested trying it for a while because it's cheaper and healthier, but the wife refused. The husband then called her selfish, leading to a breakdown in discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and likely dealing with physical and emotional changes. Her decision not to breastfeed is a personal choice, even if the husband disagrees. Breastfeeding is a medical decision with various factors, and while there are benefits, it's not the only way to feed a baby. The husband's motivation is to save money and health benefits, which are valid, but he might not be considering his wife's autonomy and her current situation.\n\nCalling someone selfish is a strong accusation. It could make the wife feel disrespected, especially during a vulnerable time. The husband's approach might have been confrontational instead of collaborative. The wife's desire for her body back is a legitimate concern; postpartum recovery is significant, and personal well-being is important.\n\nHowever, the husband's intention to discuss and find a middle ground (trying for a bit) is understandable. The issue is how he communicated his stance. Using accusatory language like \"selfish\" can shut down communication, which is what happened here. Effective communication is crucial in such decisions, and the husband might have failed in that aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's decision is her right, and the husband's push to influence that choice could be seen as overstepping. The key factors are respect for autonomy, communication style, and understanding each other's perspectives. The husband's mistake was the accusation of selfishness rather than expressing his concerns respectfully and supporting his wife's choice, even if he disagrees.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband is in the wrong because he used a harsh and disrespectful term that undermined his wife's autonomy and caused a rift in communication. The right approach would have been to support her decision while discussing the alternatives without judgment.\n"
