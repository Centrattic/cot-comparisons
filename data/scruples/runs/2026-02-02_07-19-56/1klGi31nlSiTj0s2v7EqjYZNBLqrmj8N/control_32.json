She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband calling his pregnant wife selfish for deciding not to breastfeed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife originally planned to breastfeed but changed her mind because she wants her body back. The husband is upset because he thinks breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper. He called her selfish, and now they're not talking. \n\nIs the husband wrong for calling her selfish? Well, breastfeeding is a personal choice. The wife's decision could be based on her physical and emotional needs. Even though breastfeeding has health benefits, the mother's comfort and willingness are important. The husband's comment about selfishness might dismiss her valid reasons. \n\nBut maybe the husband's intention was to encourage trying it out. However, saying she's selfish could be hurtful. The key is whether his criticism was valid. Since the wife has the right to make this decision, the husband's reaction might be inappropriate. \n\nSo the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong because he's trying to consider the baby's health. However, the way he framed it as selfishness is probably the issue. So A is the correct choice here.\n"
