She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for calling their pregnant wife selfish because she changed her mind about breastfeeding. The wife wants her body back, and the husband wants her to try breastfeeding for cost and health reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The wife is pregnant and due soon. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind. The husband wants her to try it, but she refuses, citing wanting her body back. He calls her selfish, and now there's a communication breakdown.\n\nBreastfeeding is often a personal choice. While it has health benefits, it's not a legal requirement. The wife's decision to prioritize her own needs is valid. The husband's approach might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Calling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially in a relationship. Maybe he should have discussed it more empathetically instead of labeling her as selfish.\n\nAlso, considering her pregnancy, she might be dealing with physical and emotional changes. The pressure to breastfeed can be high, but it's important to respect her choice. The husband's focus on cost and health might not outweigh her personal needs. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision and the way he addressed it.\n"
