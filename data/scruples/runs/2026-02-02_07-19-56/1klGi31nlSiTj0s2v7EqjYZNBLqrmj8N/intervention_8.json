She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The wife is pregnant and changed her mind about breastfeeding, saying she wants her body back. The husband thinks she's being selfish and now they're not talking about it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is making a personal decision about her body. Breastfeeding is a choice, and while it has health benefits, it's not the only factor. The husband's argument is about health and cost, but the wife's reasoning is about her own autonomy and well-being. \n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful. Maybe the husband didn't consider her perspective. The wife might be dealing with physical or emotional challenges, and her decision is valid. The husband's approach of labeling her as selfish might have shut down communication, which is not helpful. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to advocate for the baby's health and economic reasons. But it's important to respect the mother's autonomy. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can find a solution together without judgment. \n\nSo, the husband's approach of calling her selfish is likely the wrong way to handle the situation. He should have discussed it more empathetically. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
