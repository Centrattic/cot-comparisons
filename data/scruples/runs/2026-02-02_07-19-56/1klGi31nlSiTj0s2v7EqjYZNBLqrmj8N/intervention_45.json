      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who called their pregnant wife selfish is in the wrong. The wife initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind, citing wanting her body back. The husband suggests trying it for a bit for health and cost reasons, but she refuses. He calls her selfish, and now there's no discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is pregnant and due soon, which is a significant life event. Her decision to stop wanting to breastfeed could be influenced by various factors\u2014physical discomfort, emotional stress, or personal priorities. Breastfeeding is often a deeply personal choice and can be challenging. The key here is whether the husband's reaction is justified.\n\nCalling someone selfish is a strong accusation. It implies that her decision is solely about her own interests without considering others. However, the wife's reason is about reclaiming her body, which is a valid personal choice. The husband might be prioritizing the baby's health and cost, but he's framing her decision as selfishness, which could undermine her autonomy.\n\nHealthier and cheaper options are important, but the mother's well-being and comfort are also crucial. The wife might have valid reasons for changing her mind, such as physical discomfort, mental health, or previous experiences. The husband's approach of labeling her selfish might have shut down communication, which is counterproductive. Open dialogue and mutual understanding are essential in such situations.\n\nAlso, societal pressures around breastfeeding can be intense. It's possible the husband is under the impression that breastfeeding is the only healthy option, not considering that the mother's health and willingness are equally important. The wife's right to make decisions about her body is a significant factor here. The husband's comment could be seen as dismissive of her needs and a failure to support her in a respectful manner.\n\nIn summary, while the husband's intention might be to advocate for the baby's health, his method of calling his wife selfish is likely the wrong approach. It's important to respect her autonomy and find a solution that both parties can agree on through discussion rather than confrontation. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
