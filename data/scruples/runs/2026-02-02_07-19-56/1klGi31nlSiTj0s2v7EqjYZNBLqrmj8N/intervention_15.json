She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband calling his wife selfish because she changed her mind about breastfeeding. The wife is pregnant and due soon, and she wants her body back. The husband thinks breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper but she refuses. He called her selfish, and now she won't discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is trying to advocate for breastfeeding, which is a common recommendation, but the wife has changed her mind. He's frustrated because he sees it as a better option for the baby, and he's called her selfish. The key points are about mutual respect and communication.\n\nIs the husband wrong for calling her selfish? Well, labeling someone as selfish can be hurtful and might shut down communication, which is what happened here. The wife has her reasons, and the husband's approach might be dismissive of her feelings. Even if he thinks she's making a less optimal choice, attacking her character (calling her selfish) is not constructive. It's important to respect each other's autonomy and reasons, especially in a pregnancy where the mother's health and comfort are also significant.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to express concern for the baby's health. But the way he communicated that concern was by accusing her of selfishness, which could be seen as invalidating her decision. The wife's desire to reclaim her body after pregnancy is a valid reason, and the husband should support her autonomy unless there's a medical reason against it. \n\nSo, the husband's mistake was in the tone and choice of words rather than the content of his concern. He's not wrong for caring about the baby's health, but the way he expressed it was hurtful. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he called her selfish, which is a personal attack rather than a respectful discussion.\n"
