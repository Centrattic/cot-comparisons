She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband calling his pregnant wife selfish because she changed her mind about breastfeeding. The wife initially planned to breastfeed but now wants to stop, citing wanting her body back. The husband is frustrated and called her selfish, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's concern is understandable\u2014breastfeeding can be healthier and cheaper. But he's framing his wife's decision as selfish. However, the wife is pregnant and due soon, so her decision might be influenced by her current physical and emotional state. She might be dealing with postpartum anxiety, fatigue, or other factors that make breastfeeding difficult or undesirable. \n\nFrom a medical standpoint, while breastfeeding is recommended, it's not the only way to feed a baby, and formula can be a safe alternative if necessary. The key issue here is whether the husband's reaction is appropriate. Calling someone selfish without understanding their reasons can be hurtful, especially during a time of significant life changes. The wife's health and comfort are important, and her body's needs shouldn't be dismissed as selfish. \n\nThe husband's approach of asking her to try breastfeeding without acknowledging her feelings might not be collaborative. Effective communication is crucial in such situations. By labeling her as selfish, he may be invalidating her feelings, which can lead to resentment and a lack of discussion. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife changing her mind without discussing it with her husband could be abrupt. However, major life decisions, especially those involving health and personal well-being, are complex. The husband's role is to support her decision, even if he disagrees, rather than criticize her motives. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy and emotions is vital. The husband's use of the term \"selfish\" seems judgmental and might not consider the broader context of her decision. Therefore, the husband's reaction is likely to be seen as the problem here.\n"
