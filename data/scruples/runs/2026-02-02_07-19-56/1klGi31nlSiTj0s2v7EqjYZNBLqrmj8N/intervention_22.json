She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a husband whose wife is pregnant and due in a month. She changed her mind about breastfeeding because she wants her body back for herself. He asked her to try, saying it's healthier and cheaper, but she refused. He called her selfish, and now she's not discussing it. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The wife is pregnant and likely dealing with physical and emotional changes. Breastfeeding is a personal decision, and she's made a choice based on her own priorities. The husband is trying to influence her by pointing out health and cost benefits. However, he called her selfish, which is a strong accusation. \n\nSelfishness usually implies that someone is prioritizing their own needs at the expense of others. But in this case, the wife is making a choice that affects her own body and well-being. Even if the husband thinks it's better for the baby and the family financially, the decision to breastfeed is hers. By labeling her as selfish, he might be dismissing her valid reasons and not respecting her autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's concern for the baby's health and the family's financial situation is understandable. He's trying to encourage her to make what he sees as a better choice. But the way he's approaching it by calling her selfish could be damaging. It's possible he's not considering her perspective and the pressure she's under during pregnancy. \n\nI also need to think about communication. Using labels like \"selfish\" can lead to defensiveness and stop productive conversation. The wife's refusal to discuss it now might be a result of feeling attacked. The husband's approach might have hurt her feelings, making her less likely to listen to his concerns. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting individual autonomy is important. The wife has the right to make decisions about her body, even if someone else disagrees. The husband's role is to support her choice, even if he doesn't agree, rather than criticize her. \n\nSo, putting this together, the husband's use of the term \"selfish\" seems to be the issue here. It's a judgmental statement that undermines her agency. Even if his intentions are good, the method of communication was poor. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong for calling her selfish in this situation.\n"
