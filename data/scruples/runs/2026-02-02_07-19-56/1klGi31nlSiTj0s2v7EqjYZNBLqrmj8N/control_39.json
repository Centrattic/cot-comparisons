She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife changing her mind on breastfeeding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due soon. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind, stating she wants her body back for herself. The husband wants her to try it for the baby's health and cost, but she refuses. He calls her selfish, and now they're not talking about it.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice. The wife might have valid reasons for changing her mind, like physical discomfort, mental health, or other factors. Even if the husband thinks it's healthier, the decision should be mutual respect. Using the term \"selfish\" might be hurtful and dismiss her feelings. It's possible the husband is right in wanting to discuss it, but his approach might be wrong. Calling someone selfish can be seen as an attack, not a discussion. The wife's autonomy in her body is important. So, the husband's approach might be the issue here, leading to the wife not wanting to discuss it. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the accusatory language and not respecting her decision.\n"
