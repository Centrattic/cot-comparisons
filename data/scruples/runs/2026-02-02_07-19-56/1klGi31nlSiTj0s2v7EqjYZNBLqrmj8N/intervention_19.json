She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The context is that the wife, who's about to give birth, changed her mind about breastfeeding. The husband argues it's healthier and cheaper, but she prioritizes her own desires.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband's intention was to encourage breastfeeding for the baby's health and cost reasons. But he labeled his wife as selfish, which is a strong term. That might have been hurtful, especially since she's also dealing with pregnancy and postpartum changes. \n\nBreastfeeding can be a personal decision influenced by physical, emotional, and health factors. The wife might have valid reasons for changing her mind, like pain, health issues, or personal well-being. The husband's approach of calling her selfish could have shut down communication, leading to the wife not wanting to discuss it further. \n\nIt's important to assess whether the husband's criticism was constructive or just an emotional reaction. Using \"selfish\" might have been a judgmental label rather than understanding her perspective. Healthy communication involves listening and respecting each other's viewpoints, even if they differ. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's concern about the baby's health and cost is valid. But the way he expressed it could have been more supportive. The key issue here is the use of accusatory language, which can damage relationships and prevent collaboration.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the husband's use of the term \"selfish\" might be the wrong approach, even if his intentions were to encourage breastfeeding. The answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because of the accusatory language and lack of support for his wife's decision.\n"
