She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for calling his wife selfish. The situation is about the wife changing her mind on breastfeeding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due soon. Originally planned to breastfeed but changed her mind because she wants her body back. The husband wants her to try it for health and cost reasons, but she refuses. He calls her selfish, and now there's a communication breakdown.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice. While there are health benefits, it's not a one-size-fits-all decision. The wife's reason for not breastfeeding is about her own body and autonomy. The husband's criticism as selfish might overlook her personal needs and stress. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Labeling someone as selfish can be hurtful and shut down dialogue. The husband's approach might be dismissive of her feelings and reasons. Even if he has valid points about health and cost, the way he expressed it (calling her selfish) is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. His approach to the conversation was flawed, and he should have handled it with more empathy.\n"
