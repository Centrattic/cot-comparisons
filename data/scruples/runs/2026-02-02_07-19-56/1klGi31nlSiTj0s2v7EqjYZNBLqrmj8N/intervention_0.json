      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband called his pregnant wife selfish for deciding not to breastfeed. The wife changed her mind because she wants her body back, and the husband is upset because he thinks breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is pregnant and about to give birth. Her decision not to breastfeed could be influenced by various factors like her physical and mental health, previous experiences, or personal preferences. She might be dealing with stress or pressure, and her comment about wanting her body back suggests she's prioritizing her own well-being, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's concern is about the baby's health and cost. But breastfeeding isn't the only healthy option, and formula can be a safe alternative. The husband called her selfish, which is a strong and accusatory term. That could have hurt her feelings and shut down communication. It's important to note that a pregnant woman's health and comfort are significant, especially as she approaches childbirth.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The husband's approach might have been confrontational instead of supportive. Even if he has valid concerns, calling her selfish isn't constructive. The wife might feel that her autonomy is being challenged, especially regarding her body and parenting choices. The husband should have discussed his concerns in a way that acknowledges her feelings and preferences, perhaps seeking a compromise or understanding the reasons behind her decision without judgment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, using derogatory language in a disagreement is generally not advisable. The husband's use of \"selfish\" might have been dismissive of his wife's feelings and priorities. However, he had a genuine concern about the baby's health. But the way he expressed it was problematic. The answer likely leans towards the husband being in the wrong for the way he communicated, even if his intentions were to advocate for the baby's health.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the husband's approach was flawed. The answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
