She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife deciding not to breastfeed, and the husband calls her selfish. The question is whether the husband is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He wanted her to try breastfeeding for health and cost reasons. But the wife is making a personal choice about her body. So, is it right for him to label her as selfish?\n\nWell, the wife is making a decision about her own body. Even though breastfeeding is recommended, the final decision is hers. The husband's reaction might be based on wanting what's best for the baby, but he's not the one undergoing the physical process. Insulting her as selfish could be hurtful and might close off communication. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to advocate for the baby's health. But maybe he didn't consider her feelings or reasons enough. The wife's reason is about her body and personal desire, which is valid. Labeling her selfish could undermine her autonomy.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural or medical context I'm missing. Generally, in modern medicine, while breastfeeding is encouraged, it's recognized that some women can't or choose not to. The decision should be mutual and respected. The husband's approach here was confrontational, which might be the issue.\n\nSo, the main points are: the wife's right to her body, the husband's communication style, and mutual decision-making. The husband's use of the term \"selfish\" might be the problem here. It's possible he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her choice and is using a judgmental term. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
