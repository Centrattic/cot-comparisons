      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the wife deciding not to breastfeed after initially planning to, and the husband calls her selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. She changed her mind about breastfeeding, citing that she wants her body back. The husband suggests trying it for a while because it's healthier and cheaper. He calls her selfish, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice, and while there are health benefits, it's not a one-size-fits-all decision. The wife's decision could be influenced by various factors\u2014physical discomfort, mental health, personal priorities, etc. The husband's approach of labeling her as selfish might be hurtful and dismissive of her reasons. It's possible that his comment undermines her autonomy and the valid reasons she has for her choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention might be to consider the baby's health and financial aspects. However, using the term \"selfish\" can be seen as attacking her character rather than discussing the issue constructively. Healthy communication in relationships involves empathy and understanding each other's perspectives. By calling her selfish, the husband might have invalidated her feelings, making her reluctant to discuss the matter further.\n\nSo, the question is whether his criticism is justified. Since the wife's decision is her choice, the husband shouldn't dictate it, especially by labeling her negatively. The husband's approach likely hurt the wife, leading to her withdrawal from discussion. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and using harsh language.\n"
