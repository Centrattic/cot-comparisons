She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife who changed her mind about breastfeeding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife initially planned to breastfeed but now wants to stop because she wants her body back. The husband is concerned about health and cost, so he called her selfish. The wife is upset and won't discuss it anymore.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice and can be physically and emotionally demanding. The wife's decision might be based on her own needs and circumstances. The husband's argument is valid from a health and cost perspective, but how he expressed it\u2014calling her selfish\u2014is a problem. \n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially in a relationship. It's important to communicate respectfully. The husband's approach might have been confrontational instead of collaborative. The wife's right to make her own medical decisions is crucial here. The husband should have tried to understand her reasons rather than labeling her.\n\nSo, the husband's tone and choice of words likely damaged the conversation. Even if his intentions were to find a solution, the method was flawed. The wife's autonomy in healthcare decisions is key. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong for using a derogatory term instead of discussing it calmly.\n"
