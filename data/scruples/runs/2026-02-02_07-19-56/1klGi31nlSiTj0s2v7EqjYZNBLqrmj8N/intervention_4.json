She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife deciding not to breastfeed after initially planning to, and the husband is upset because he thinks it's healthier and cheaper. The wife says she wants her body back for herself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The wife is pregnant and due in a month, so she's probably dealing with a lot of physical and emotional changes. Her decision to not breastfeed is her own medical choice, and she might have valid personal or health reasons. The husband is trying to persuade her to try, which might be reasonable, but calling her selfish crosses a line. It's important to consider autonomy in medical decisions, especially when it's the mother's body. \n\nSelfishness is a strong term and can be hurtful. The husband might not be considering her feelings or the reasons behind her decision. The fact that she won't discuss it now shows that his comment damaged the conversation. Even if the husband's intention was to do what's best for the baby, using derogatory language like \"selfish\" is not constructive. \n\nSo, the key points are: respect for personal autonomy, communication style, and understanding her perspective. The husband's approach might be well-meaning but the method is flawed. Therefore, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
