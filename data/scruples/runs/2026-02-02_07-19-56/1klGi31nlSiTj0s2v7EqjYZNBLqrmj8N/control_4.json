She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is pregnant and planning to breastfeed but now has changed her mind. The husband wants her to try because it's healthier and cheaper. She refuses, citing wanting her body back for herself. He calls her selfish, and she's not discussing it anymore. The user wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. I need to consider both sides. Breastfeeding is a personal choice. The wife might be experiencing physical or emotional reasons for changing her mind. Maybe she's feeling pressured, especially since she's pregnant and dealing with her own health. Her reasoning about her body is valid\u2014everyone has autonomy over their own body. The husband's argument about health and cost is practical, but does that justify labeling her as selfish?\n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful. It might make her feel like her needs aren't being considered. The husband should engage in a more empathetic conversation rather than making an accusatory statement. The wife's desire for her body back is a personal choice, and it's important to respect that even if you don't agree. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not understanding her perspective and using a harsh term. The answer is likely A.\n"
