      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for calling their wife selfish because she decided not to breastfeed. The wife was pregnant and had originally planned to breastfeed but changed her mind, saying she wants her body back. The husband asked her to try a bit for the baby's health and cost, but she refused. He called her selfish, and now they can't talk about it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and the wife is making a decision about her body. The husband is concerned about the baby's health and cost, which are valid points, but he's framing her decision as selfish. Is that fair?\n\nSelfishness usually means putting one's own needs above others without consideration. However, the wife's decision is about her own health and autonomy. Maybe she has other reasons not mentioned, like physical discomfort, mental health issues, or previous negative experiences. The husband might not be considering her perspective fully.\n\nThe key here is whether the term \"selfish\" was appropriate. Using such a strong, judgmental term can shut down communication, which is what's happening now. Even if the husband has valid concerns, accusing the wife of selfishness might be dismissive of her reasons. It's possible that the husband isn't in the wrong entirely, but his approach was hurtful.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's trying to discuss the issue and the wife isn't listening, maybe there's a communication breakdown on both sides. However, calling someone selfish when they're making a personal health decision could be seen as invalidating her choice. The husband's intentions might be to prioritize the baby's health, but the way he expressed it was unhelpful.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he used a term that's disrespectful and didn't consider his wife's autonomy and reasons. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
