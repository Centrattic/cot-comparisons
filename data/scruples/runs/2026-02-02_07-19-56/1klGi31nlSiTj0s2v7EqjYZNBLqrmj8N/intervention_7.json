She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their pregnant wife selfish is in the wrong. The scenario involves the wife changing her mind about breastfeeding, and the husband calling her selfish because he thinks it's healthier and cheaper.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due in a month, so this is a significant life event. The husband's argument is based on health and financial benefits of breastfeeding, but the wife's reason for changing her mind is that she wants her body back for herself. That's a personal choice, and it's important to respect a woman's autonomy over her body, especially in such a personal decision.\n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful and dismissive of their personal reasons. The husband is prioritizing the baby's health and cost, but the wife's decision is about her own physical and emotional well-being. The key here is whether the husband is respecting her choice. Even if he disagrees, labeling her as selfish is likely damaging to their relationship and communication. \n\nAlso, the wife's decision to stop trying breastfeeding is a medical and personal one that should be discussed with healthcare providers. The husband's insistence might not take into account her physical or emotional state, which could be a valid reason for her change of heart. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband's role is to support his wife, not to dictate her choices. Even if he has concerns, framing them as her being selfish undermines her agency. The fact that she's now avoiding discussion suggests that his approach has caused a rift. \n\nSo, considering these points, the husband's use of the word \"selfish\" might be inconsiderate and could be seen as the wrong approach. The answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
