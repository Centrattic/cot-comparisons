She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife changed her mind about breastfeeding, and the husband called her selfish. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind, citing wanting her body back. The husband is concerned about the baby's health and cost, suggesting she try it first. He calls her selfish, and now they're not discussing it.\n\nBreastfeeding can be a personal choice. The wife has her reasons, which are about her own well-being and autonomy. The husband's concern is valid, but how he expressed it might be the issue. Calling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially in a personal relationship. It's possible he didn't consider her feelings or the reasons behind her decision. The wife's right to her body is important here. The husband might have approached the conversation without empathy, leading to a breakdown in communication. So, even if his intention was to encourage breastfeeding, the way he framed it as selfishness could be inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision and choice, using a harsh term that could damage their relationship. So the answer would be A.\n"
