She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about their pregnant wife changing her mind about breastfeeding. The husband wants her to try it because it's cheaper and healthier, but she refuses, stating she wants her body back. He calls her selfish, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is pregnant, so she's likely going through physical and emotional changes. Her decision not to breastfeed is personal and might be influenced by her own health or priorities. The husband's argument is about the baby's health and cost, but he's dismissing her reasons as selfish. \n\nSelfishness is a strong term. It implies she's not considering others' needs, but she's making a choice based on her own well-being. Every parent makes trade-offs, and this might be her way of balancing her needs with the baby's. The husband's approach might be invalidating her feelings, which can lead to conflict. \n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. The husband's reaction of labeling her as selfish instead of discussing her decision respectfully could be the root of the problem. Even if he disagrees, using such a term might shut down dialogue. \n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice. While there are health benefits, it's not a one-size-fits-all decision. The wife has autonomy over her body, and the husband shouldn't pressure her beyond respectful discussion. His approach might be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nSo, the husband's use of the term \"selfish\" might be inappropriate here, as it's dismissive of her valid reasons. He's in the wrong because he's not respecting her decision and is using a derogatory term that harms their relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
