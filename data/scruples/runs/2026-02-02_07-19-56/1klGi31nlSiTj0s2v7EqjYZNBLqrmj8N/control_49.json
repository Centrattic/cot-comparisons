She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person is a husband whose pregnant wife has decided against breastfeeding. He's upset because she changed her mind, even though she wanted to breastfeed before. He called her selfish for wanting her body back, and now she won't talk to him. He's asking if he's the a**hole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The wife is due in a month, so she's in her third trimester. Deciding not to breastfeed can be influenced by many factors. The husband's argument is about health and cost, but the wife is prioritizing her own needs. \n\nCalling someone selfish is a strong accusation. It's possible that he's trying to guilt-trip her into doing what he thinks is best, but maybe not considering her feelings or autonomy. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and even if it's recommended, it's not always feasible or desired. Women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, even if others disagree.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to communicate his concerns. But using the term \"selfish\" might come off as dismissive of her reasons. It's important in relationships to validate each other's feelings, even when there's disagreement. If the wife feels attacked, that could lead to the breakdown in communication mentioned here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the wife's decision is about her body, the husband's approach might be invalidating, and the use of a strong term like \"selfish\" could be the issue here. The answer likely depends on whether the husband overstepped in his criticism without understanding her perspective. I think the husband is in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision and used a hurtful label. So the answer should be A.\n"
