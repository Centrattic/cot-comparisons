      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for calling his wife selfish. The situation is that his wife, who is pregnant and due in a month, changed her mind about breastfeeding. She wants her body back, and he thinks she's being selfish for not trying to breastfeed. He called her that, and now she won't discuss it with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is making a personal health decision for herself and the baby. Breastfeeding is often recommended, but it's not without its challenges. The husband is pushing for it because he thinks it's healthier and cheaper. But the wife's decision to not breastfeed could be based on her own physical and emotional needs, especially after the stress of pregnancy and impending childbirth.\n\nThe key point here is the husband calling her selfish. Using the label \"selfish\" implies that her decision is inconsiderate of others, in this case, the baby's health. However, the wife is making a choice about her own body. While the husband has valid concerns about the baby's health and cost, he needs to respect her autonomy. The term \"selfish\" can come off as dismissive of her reasons and might not be constructive for their relationship. \n\nAlso, the wife's reason for wanting her body back is understandable. Postpartum recovery is a big deal, and breastfeeding can be physically and emotionally demanding. The husband's approach of pressuring her might be causing more tension than necessary. Instead of labeling her decision as selfish, he should focus on finding a solution that respects her choice while addressing their shared concerns about the baby's health. \n\nSo, while the husband might have good intentions, using the term \"selfish\" is likely hurtful and undermines his wife's autonomy. The right approach would be to support her decision while still discussing alternatives, like formula, and ensuring the baby gets proper nutrition. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong here for using that term and not fully respecting her decision.\n"
