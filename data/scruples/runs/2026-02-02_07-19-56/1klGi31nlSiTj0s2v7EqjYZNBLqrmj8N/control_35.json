      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for calling his wife selfish. The situation is that the wife, who is pregnant and planning to breastfeed, changed her mind and wants to stop before even trying. The husband thinks she's being selfish because he mentions health and cost benefits. He called her that, and now she won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's looking out for the baby's health and the family's financial situation. He's trying to reason with her to at least attempt breastfeeding. But the wife's reason for changing her mind is that she wants her body back. That's a personal choice, and she's going through pregnancy and possibly postpartum changes, which can be physically and emotionally taxing.\n\nNow, calling someone selfish is a strong accusation. Selfishness usually implies that someone is prioritizing their own needs at the expense of others. In this case, the wife is making a decision that affects their child's health and their family's finances but also her own well-being. It's possible that her reasons are valid, such as physical discomfort, mental health, or personal priorities. The husband's use of the term \"selfish\" might come across as dismissive of her feelings and reasons. Even if he thinks he's right, using such a label can be hurtful and shut down communication, which is what happened here.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention is to encourage what he sees as a better choice. He's trying to find a middle ground by suggesting she at least tries. However, his approach might have been harsh, and the word \"selfish\" could be seen as attacking her character rather than discussing the issue. Healthy communication is key in relationships, and using accusatory language can prevent productive dialogue.\n\nAlso, considering the context, pregnancy and postpartum decisions are complex. The mother has her own physical and emotional needs, and the decision to breastfeed isn't just about the baby's health. There's a lot of pressure on new mothers, and calling her selfish might make her feel invalidated. It's important to respect her autonomy in making healthcare decisions, even if there's disagreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband might be in the wrong because his choice of words was harsh and potentially hurtful, undermining his wife's autonomy and possibly her mental health. The key issue is the use of the term \"selfish\" rather than the disagreement itself. Even if the disagreement is valid, the way he expressed it is problematic. Therefore, the answer would lean towards AITA meaning he is in the wrong.\n"
