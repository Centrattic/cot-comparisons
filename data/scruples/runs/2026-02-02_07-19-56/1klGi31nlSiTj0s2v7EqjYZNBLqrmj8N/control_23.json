      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation involves the wife changing her mind about breastfeeding, which the husband disagrees with because he thinks it's better for the baby and cheaper. He calls her selfish, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Breastfeeding decisions are personal and can be influenced by various factors like health, personal choice, and lifestyle. The wife is pregnant and might be experiencing physical or emotional changes that affect her decision. The husband's main concern seems to be the health and cost, but he's framing her decision as selfish, which could be dismissive of her needs and feelings.\n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially in a close relationship. It's important to validate each other's perspectives. The wife's desire to reclaim her body is a valid point; she might be dealing with postpartum recovery, stress, or other personal reasons. The husband's approach of pushing for breastfeeding without understanding her reasons might come off as controlling. The fact that she's now unwilling to discuss it suggests that the communication has broken down, which the husband's comment might have contributed to.\n\nHowever, the husband does have a valid concern about the health benefits for the baby. The key here is how the information is presented. Instead of accusing her of selfishness, he could have approached the conversation with empathy, asking about her reasons and finding a compromise, like trying for a short period. The problem seems to be in the delivery of his message rather than the content. \n\nIn relationships, how you express your needs matters. Using \"I\" statements and showing willingness to listen can prevent such conflicts. The husband's use of \"selfish\" labels her choice negatively, which might not be constructive. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and understanding.\n"
