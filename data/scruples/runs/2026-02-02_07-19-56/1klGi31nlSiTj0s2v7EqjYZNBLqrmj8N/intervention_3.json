She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for calling their pregnant wife selfish over her decision not to breastfeed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife was planning to breastfeed but changed her mind because she wants her body back. The husband suggests trying it for a bit since it's healthier and cheaper, but she refuses. He calls her selfish, and now there's no discussion. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSelfishness is a strong term. The key here is whether the husband's criticism is justified. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and women have the right to make decisions about their bodies. The wife's reason for not breastfeeding is about her own health and autonomy. The husband might be trying to do what's best for the baby, but he's framing her decision as selfish, which could undermine her agency.\n\nIn relationships, how we communicate is crucial. Using accusatory language like \"selfish\" can be hurtful and shut down dialogue. Even if the husband is concerned about the baby's health, he should approach the conversation without blaming her. The fact that she changed her mind might be due to new information or her own priorities, which are valid.\n\nLegally and ethically, the decision to breastfeed is the mother's. The husband's role is to support her decision, not to pressure her into something she's not comfortable with. The term \"selfish\" implies that her decision benefits only herself, but her choice might be based on her physical and emotional well-being, which is important too.\n\nSo, the husband's approach is likely the issue here. Instead of calling her selfish, he should listen and support her choice, even if he disagrees. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's autonomy and is using language that damages their communication.\n"
