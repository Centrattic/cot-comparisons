      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about their baby being due in a month. The wife initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind, saying she wants her body back. The husband asked her to try, mentioning it's healthier and cheaper, but she refused. He called her selfish, and now she's not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and the wife is making a decision about her body. The husband is concerned about health and cost, which are valid points, but he's framing her decision as selfish. That's the key point here. \n\nSelfishness usually implies disregarding others' needs. However, the wife is prioritizing her own needs and preferences. Her right to make decisions about her body is important. The husband is pressuring her, which might not be appropriate. Even if his intentions are good, accusing her of being selfish could be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The husband's approach of labeling her as selfish might have damaged the discussion. Instead of using that term, he could have tried to understand her reasoning. The fact that she changed her mind might be due to various factors like health, stress, or personal reasons, which he hasn't considered.\n\nLegally and ethically, the mother has the right to choose how to feed her child. The husband's argument about health and cost is common, but it's not the only factor. The wife's emotional and physical well-being matters too. By calling her selfish, he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. The husband's response might be seen as invalidating her choice, leading to conflict. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong for using the term selfish and not respecting her decision.\n"
