She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for calling their wife selfish during her pregnancy. The wife initially wanted to breastfeed but changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. The author asked her to try for a bit, as it's healthier and cheaper, but she refused. Then he called her selfish and now she's not discussing it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy and postpartum decisions can be really sensitive. Breastfeeding is often a big topic, and people have different reasons for choosing it or not. The wife's decision to prioritize her own body and well-being is a valid reason. The author's main point is about the health and cost benefits, but he frames her refusal as selfish.\n\nIs calling someone selfish in this situation wrong? Well, it's a strong word. It implies that she's not considering others' needs, which can be hurtful. Even if the author has good intentions, using that term might have been dismissive of her personal reasons. The wife's autonomy over her body is important, and the author's approach might have been more about his preferences than hers. So, the author might have miscommunicated. Instead of labeling her selfish, he could have expressed his concerns more empathetically and supported her choice even if he disagrees. \n\nThe fact that she's now avoiding the discussion suggests that the label hurt her feelings. It's possible he didn't consider the emotional impact of his words. While he's trying to do what's best for the baby, he needs to balance that with respecting his wife's autonomy and feelings. So, the answer is likely A, but I need to make sure there's not a misunderstanding. Let me check again. The key issue is using \"selfish\" which might be the wrong approach, even if the concern is valid. So, the author is in the wrong for using that term.\n"
