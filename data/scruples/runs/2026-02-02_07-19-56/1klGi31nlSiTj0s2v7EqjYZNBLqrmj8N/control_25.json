She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife changing her mind on breastfeeding because she wants her body back. The husband is upset, says it's healthier and cheaper, and called her selfish. Now she's not discussing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and the wife is pregnant, so her body is going through a lot. She might have valid reasons for changing her mind, like health issues, stress, or not wanting to prioritize her body in a certain way. The husband's argument is about health and cost, which are practical reasons, but maybe he's not considering her feelings or autonomy.\n\nCalling someone selfish can come off as dismissive. Even if the husband's intentions are good, using that term might be hurtful. The wife's decision is about her body and her needs, so the husband's reaction could be seen as invalidating her choice. However, the husband is trying to reason with her, which is understandable. But the accusation of selfishness might be where he's wrong.\n\nI should think about the balance between respecting personal autonomy and trying to find a compromise. The wife's right to make decisions about her body is important. The husband's approach might be condescending or not supportive enough. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he labeled his wife selfish, which isn't constructive, and didn't respect her autonomy.\n"
