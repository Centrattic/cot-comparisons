      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for calling his pregnant wife selfish. The wife changed her mind about breastfeeding, and he called her selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The wife is pregnant, due soon. She initially planned to breastfeed but now wants to stop. She says she wants her body back for herself. The husband is trying to convince her to try it for a bit because it's healthier and cheaper. When she refuses, he calls her selfish, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, understanding the dynamics. Breastfeeding is a personal choice and can be physically and emotionally challenging. The wife might have valid reasons for changing her mind, maybe related to her own health, the stress of a new baby, or other factors. The husband's concern about health and cost is valid, but pushing for it could overlook her autonomy.\n\nCalling someone selfish is a strong accusation. It implies she's prioritizing her needs over the baby's, which might not be fair. The wife's decision to stop could be about reclaiming her body after pregnancy, which is a significant life change. The husband's approach might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and choices.\n\nBut also, the husband's intention is to do what's best for the baby. However, how he communicates that matters. Using the term \"selfish\" might be hurtful and shutting down dialogue, as mentioned the wife won't discuss it anymore. Effective communication is key in relationships, especially during high-stress times like pregnancy.\n\nSo, the husband's error might be in the word choice and approach. Instead of labeling her selfish, he could have expressed his concerns more supportively. The wife's right to make decisions about her body is important, and the husband needs to respect that even if he disagrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the husband is in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting his wife's autonomy and using a hurtful label, which is counterproductive.\n"
