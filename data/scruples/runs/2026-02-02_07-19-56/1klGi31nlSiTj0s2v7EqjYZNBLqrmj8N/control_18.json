      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The context is that the wife changed her mind about breastfeeding, and the husband thinks she's being selfish because he wants her to at least try for the baby's health and cost reasons. He called her selfish, and now she's not talking to him. The user wants to know if the husband is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is pregnant and due in a month, so this is a significant life change for both. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind. Her reasoning is that she wants her body back for herself. The husband is pushing her to try, citing health and cost benefits.\n\nNow, the key point is whether calling her selfish is appropriate. Selfishness is a strong term. The husband is framing her decision as self-centered, but the wife's decision is about her own needs and boundaries. Breastfeeding can be physically and emotionally demanding, and every woman's situation is different. The husband's insistence might not consider her autonomy and the pressures she's facing.\n\nThe husband's argument is that breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper. While that's true in some cases, it's not the only factor. The wife's health, comfort, and willingness are crucial. The husband dismissing her choice as selfish could be undermining her and not respecting her agency. This could lead to resentment and communication breakdown, as seen in their current stalemate.\n\nAlso, the timing is important. Being due in a month, the wife might be dealing with various physical and emotional changes. Her decision to prioritize her own needs might be valid. The husband's approach might be more about his own expectations rather than truly understanding her perspective.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's decisions and supporting each other through challenges is key. The husband's use of \"selfish\" labels her decision negatively without considering her reasons. It's possible he's not in the wrong entirely, but his approach is lacking empathy. However, the question is whether he's at fault. Since calling someone selfish without understanding their full context can be hurtful, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a middle ground. The husband has a valid concern about the baby's health and cost, but his method of addressing it is problematic. So, the answer is A.\n"
