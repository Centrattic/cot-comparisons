      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife is pregnant and decided not to breastfeed, and the husband called her selfish. The user wants to know if the husband is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and the wife is making a decision that affects her body. The husband's stance is that breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper, so he's pushing her to try, but she's standing by her decision to prioritize her own comfort and autonomy.\n\nCalling someone selfish can be hurtful, especially in a marriage. The key here is whether the husband's comment was justified. The wife is making a choice that's important to her, and the husband's criticism might be invalidating her autonomy. Even if the husband has valid concerns (health and cost), the way he expressed them by labeling her as selfish could be seen as dismissive of her needs and feelings.\n\nAlso, the wife's reason for not wanting to breastfeed is that she wants her body back for herself. That's a legitimate personal reason. The husband's response might have been a knee-jerk reaction, not considering her emotional state or the stress of being pregnant. Communication is crucial in such situations. The fact that she won't discuss it anymore after being called selfish suggests that the term was damaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that he's trying to do what's best for the baby. But the problem is that the approach taken\u2014calling her selfish\u2014might not be constructive. It's possible that a more collaborative discussion about alternatives or compromises could have been better, rather than criticism.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is important. The husband's comment might have undermined her agency in a decision that's her own to make. So, the answer would likely be that the husband is in the wrong for using the term selfish and not respecting her choice.\n"
