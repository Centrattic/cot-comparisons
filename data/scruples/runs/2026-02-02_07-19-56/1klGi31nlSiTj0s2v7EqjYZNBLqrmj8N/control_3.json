      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation involves their pregnant wife changing her mind about breastfeeding. The wife says she wants her body back, and the husband thinks she's being selfish by refusing to try. The wife isn't discussing it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's argument is that breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper, so he wants her to at least try. He's concerned about the baby's well-being and maybe the financial aspect. On the other hand, the wife is making a personal choice about her body. Breastfeeding can be physically demanding, and some women have health issues or other reasons not to do it. The husband called her selfish, which is a strong term and might be dismissive of her feelings and autonomy.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and social aspects. In many societies, a woman's choice regarding her body is a significant right. Pressuring someone to breastfeed, especially when they have reservations, can lead to resentment. The husband's approach might be seen as undermining her autonomy. However, his concern for the baby's health is valid. The key here is whether his method of expressing concern was appropriate.\n\nThe term \"selfish\" is judgmental. It might make the wife feel criticized, which explains why she's not discussing it anymore. Communication is crucial in such situations. Instead of labeling her, the husband might have approached the situation with more empathy, understanding her reasons, and discussing alternatives if possible. So, the husband's use of the word \"selfish\" could be the issue here, making him at fault for not respecting her autonomy and choice, even if his intentions were to promote the baby's health.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he was dismissive of his wife's autonomy and used a hurtful label.\n"
