She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife changing her mind about breastfeeding, and the husband criticizes her for being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife is pregnant and due soon, which is a significant life change. She initially planned to breastfeed but now refuses, citing wanting her body back. The husband's argument is about health and cost benefits, but the wife is prioritizing her own needs.\n\nThe key issue here is the criticism of the wife's decision as selfish. Even if the husband's intentions are about the baby's health and financial reasons, calling someone selfish in a personal relationship can be hurtful. It's important to consider autonomy in healthcare decisions. The wife has the right to make choices about her body, even if they differ from her partner's preferences.\n\nThe husband's approach might be seen as invalidating her feelings and her decision. Instead of labeling her as selfish, he should have focused on understanding her reasons and finding a compromise. The wife's change of mind could be due to various factors like physical discomfort, mental health, or personal priorities, which the husband didn't address. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The husband's response of calling her selfish might have caused a breakdown in communication, making her unwilling to discuss the issue further. This suggests that his approach was not constructive. The wife's decision, while different from his expectations, is her right as a parent. Criticizing her for it could be seen as disrespectful, especially during a vulnerable time like pregnancy.\n\nTherefore, the husband's action (calling her selfish) is likely seen as the wrong move. He should have approached the situation with empathy and support rather than judgment. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his criticism was hurtful and didn't consider her autonomy and feelings.\n"
