She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the husband is upset because his wife, who is about to give birth, decided not to breastfeed. He thinks she's being selfish and called her that. She changed her mind from originally planning to breastfeed. The husband suggested trying it for a while, but she refused, leading to a conflict where they aren't discussing it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons each side has. The husband's reasoning is about health and cost benefits for the baby. Breastfeeding is often recommended for these reasons, so he's coming from a place of concern for their baby's well-being. However, the wife's decision is based on her personal needs\u2014wanting her body back. Pregnancy and postpartum can be physically and emotionally taxing, so her desire for autonomy is valid.\n\nCalling someone selfish can be a strong and hurtful term. Even if the husband's intention is to highlight the health benefits, using such language might not be constructive. It's possible that the term \"selfish\" dismisses her feelings and reasons, which could make her reluctant to communicate further. The wife's decision might be influenced by her own health, stress levels, or other factors the husband hasn't considered.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's approach seems to focus on his perspective without fully understanding her reasons. Maybe there's more to her decision than just being selfish. For example, she might have medical concerns, mental health issues, or previous negative experiences with breastfeeding. Without considering these, his criticism could be unfair.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The husband's approach of calling her selfish might have shut down the conversation instead of fostering understanding. The wife's right to make decisions about her body is important, and her autonomy should be respected even if it differs from the husband's wishes.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and the impact of actions. While the husband's intention might be to do what's best for the baby, the impact of his words caused a rift in communication. The wife's decision is personal and her right to make that choice should be acknowledged. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and using a term that could be seen as dismissive or judgmental.\n"
