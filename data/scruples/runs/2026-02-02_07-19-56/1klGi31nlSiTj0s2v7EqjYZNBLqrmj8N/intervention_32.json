She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. The user asked her to try, mentioning it's cheaper and healthier for the baby if it works, but she refused. He called her selfish, and now she's not discussing it. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user is questioning their own action of calling their wife selfish. The key here is understanding whether that accusation was justified. Breastfeeding is a personal choice. The wife has the right to make decisions about her body, even if it's not what the partner wants. The user's reasoning was based on health and cost, but the wife prioritized her own well-being or autonomy. \n\nCalling someone selfish in such a context might be seen as invalidating her decision. Even if the user has valid points about health and cost, the wife's decision to prioritize her own needs is valid. The user's tone and choice of words (\"selfish\") could have been hurtful and disrespectful, leading to the wife refusing to discuss further. \n\nAdditionally, during pregnancy and postpartum, stress and emotions are high. The user's approach might not have been supportive enough. Instead of labeling her selfish, they could have explored alternatives like formula feeding while respecting her choice. So, the user's action of calling her selfish is likely the issue here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
