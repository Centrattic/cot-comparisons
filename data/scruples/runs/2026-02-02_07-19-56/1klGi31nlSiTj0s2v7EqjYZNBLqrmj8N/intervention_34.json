      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation involves the wife changing her mind about breastfeeding, and the husband is upset because he thinks she's being selfish. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due soon. She initially wanted to breastfeed but changed her mind, prioritizing her own desire to have her body back. The husband is frustrated because he thinks breastfeeding is healthier and cheaper, so he called her selfish. Now they're not talking about it.\n\nSo, who's right here? Well, the wife is making a personal health decision. Even though the husband thinks breastfeeding is better, the decision is hers to make. The key point is that she changed her mind for her own reasons, which is her right. The husband's response was to label her selfish, which can be hurtful. That seems like a problem because it dismisses her feelings and autonomy.\n\nBut maybe the husband's intentions are good. He's trying to do what's best for the baby. However, using the term \"selfish\" is a judgmental statement. It's possible he didn't mean to be harsh, but the language he chose might have been the issue. People can have valid reasons for their decisions, even if others disagree. The fact that the wife won't discuss it anymore suggests that the communication breakdown is due to his comment.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional state during pregnancy and postpartum, the wife might be dealing with a lot. Her priorities could be shifting, and the husband's reaction might not be supportive. Instead of calling her selfish, maybe he should have tried to understand her perspective better.\n\nIn terms of rights, the wife has the right to make decisions about her own body. Even if the husband has different opinions, respecting her choice is important. Labeling her as selfish undermines her autonomy and could lead to resentment. So, the husband might be in the wrong here for how he communicated his disagreement rather than the disagreement itself.\n\nBut wait, is there a cultural or societal aspect? In some cultures, breastfeeding is strongly encouraged, so the husband might be influenced by that. However, the core issue is about respecting her decision. The husband's approach was confrontational, which isn't helpful. The right approach would be to support her decision even if he disagrees, rather than accusing her of selfishness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. He should have communicated his concerns without labeling her, and instead sought a more supportive way to discuss their differences. The key is respecting her autonomy and finding a way to align their priorities without using derogatory language.\n"
