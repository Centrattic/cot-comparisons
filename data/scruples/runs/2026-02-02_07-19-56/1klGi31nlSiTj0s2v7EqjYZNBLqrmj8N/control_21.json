She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about their baby being due in a month, and the wife changed her mind about breastfeeding. He thinks she's being selfish because she wants her body back, and she won't discuss it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Breastfeeding is a personal choice, and the wife is making a decision about her own body. The husband is concerned about health and cost, which are valid points, but he's framing her decision as selfish. That might be the issue. Using the term \"selfish\" can be hurtful and might shut down communication. The wife's right to make decisions about her body is important. Even if the husband disagrees, calling her selfish could be seen as invalidating her choice and her needs. It's possible that the husband is prioritizing the baby's health over her autonomy, but he should respect her decision even if he doesn't agree. So, the mistake here is the labeling as selfish rather than the disagreement itself. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
