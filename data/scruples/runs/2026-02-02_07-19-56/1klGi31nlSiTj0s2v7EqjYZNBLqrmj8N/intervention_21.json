She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife who changed her mind about breastfeeding. The husband thinks she's being selfish, and now they can't talk about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind. Her reason is that she wants her body back for herself. The husband is suggesting it's healthier and cheaper, but she refuses. He calls her selfish, and now there's conflict.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice. The wife has the right to make decisions about her own body. The husband is trying to persuade her, which is okay, but calling her selfish might be crossing a line. It's important to respect each other's autonomy. Even if the husband thinks breastfeeding is better, he can't force her. The key here is whether the term \"selfish\" is appropriate. Using that term might come off as dismissive of her feelings and choices. It's possible that the husband's approach is contributing to the breakdown in communication. The wife's decision is her own, and the husband's criticism could be seen as invalidating her needs. So, the husband might be in the wrong for the way he framed the discussion instead of supporting her decision without judgment.\n"
