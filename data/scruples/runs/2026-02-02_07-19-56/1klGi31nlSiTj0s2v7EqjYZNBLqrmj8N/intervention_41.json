She originally planned to breast feed, but has suddenly decided that she doesn't even want to try, even though it's healthier for our baby. She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused. I told her she was being selfish and now she won't even discuss it with me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the wife is pregnant and decided not to breastfeed, and the husband is upset because he thinks it's healthier and cheaper. He called her selfish, and now they're not talking. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife has changed her mind about breastfeeding. Maybe there are personal reasons she hasn't shared. The husband's approach was to call her selfish, which can be a strong and hurtful accusation. Even if he's concerned about the baby's health and expenses, the way he framed his argument might be the issue. Using labels like \"selfish\" can make the other person defensive and avoid communication. It's possible the wife has valid reasons for her decision that aren't being discussed, such as health issues or personal discomfort. By calling her selfish, the husband might have dismissed her feelings or reasons, leading to the breakdown in discussion. So, the error here might be in the communication style rather than the content of his concerns. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not approaching the conversation with empathy and understanding.\n"
