She told me this and said she changed her mind because she wants her body back for herself. I asked her to just try for a bit, since it will be cheaper and healthier if it works, but she refused.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called his wife selfish is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife who changed her mind about breastfeeding. The husband thinks she's being selfish because she wants her body back, not trying for the baby's health and cost. The wife is upset and won't discuss it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is pregnant and due soon, which is a major life event. She initially planned to breastfeed but changed her mind. She gives a reason about wanting her body back, which the husband sees as selfish. The key here is whether calling her selfish is a fair response.\n\nBreastfeeding is a personal choice, and women have the right to make decisions about their bodies. The husband's argument is about the baby's health and cost, but he's framing his wife's decision as selfish. Even if his intentions are good, labeling her decision as selfish can be hurtful and dismissive of her reasons. It might not be about the baby's health but about her autonomy and how she feels about her body post-pregnancy.\n\nThe husband could have approached the conversation differently. Instead of accusing her of being selfish, maybe he could have expressed his concerns more empathetically, acknowledging her perspective. The fact that she now won't discuss it might be because she feels attacked, which isn't productive. So, the husband's approach might have been the problem here.\n\nBut wait, is it possible he's just trying to advocate for the baby's best interest? Maybe he's under stress too. However, using the term \"selfish\" is a strong and judgmental word that can shut down communication. It's important to validate her feelings before disagreeing. So, the husband's method of communication might be at fault, even if his intentions are to prioritize the baby's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife changing her mind could be due to her own health concerns or personal reasons not mentioned. The husband should respect her autonomy even if they disagree. The core issue is about mutual respect versus the baby's needs. The husband's approach might have been dismissive of her autonomy, making him at fault here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he called his wife selfish, which could have been hurtful and counterproductive to finding a solution together.\n"
