      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the person calling their pregnant wife selfish because she decided not to breastfeed. The wife changed her mind, even though she originally planned to, and the husband is upset because he thinks it's healthier and cheaper. The wife is prioritizing her own body, and the husband labels her as selfish, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and due in a month. Breastfeeding is often a personal choice, influenced by various factors like health, lifestyle, and personal preferences. The husband's argument is that it's healthier and cheaper if it works out. However, the wife is making a decision about her own body, which is a key point here. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should evaluate whether calling someone selfish is an appropriate response in this situation. Selfishness can be subjective. The wife's decision to prioritize her own well-being might be seen as self-care rather than selfishness. On the other hand, the husband is concerned about the baby's health and cost, which are valid points too.\n\nBut the core issue is the labeling. Using the term \"selfish\" can be hurtful and might not address the real concerns. Even if the husband has valid points, attacking her character by calling her selfish is likely to shut down communication, which is what happened. The wife's refusal to discuss it further suggests that the term used was damaging to their relationship dynamic.\n\nAlso, the decision to breastfeed isn't solely the mother's choice; it's a mutual family decision. However, the mother has the final say because it's her body. The husband's role here is to support her decision, even if he disagrees. Insisting she try despite her change of heart could be seen as pressuring her, which is not supportive.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband's use of the word \"selfish\" is probably inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and using a derogatory label instead of seeking understanding or compromise.\n"
