Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a cupcake that was meant to be shared but the author ate the last one instead of saving it for her husband. There's a bet involved where depending on who \"wins,\" one has to go real estate shopping or do something else.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author bought a four-pack of cupcakes, expecting each to have two. She ate hers on the first day, and her husband ate one. The next day, she noticed his second cupcake in the fridge and ate it without checking. The husband was saving it as a celebration for finishing a project. He was upset when he found out. The author argues that cupcakes have a shelf life and it was about to go bad. The husband says it's his and she should have checked first.\n\nSo, the main points are ownership and communication. The author assumed it was okay to eat the cupcake because she thought it was left uneaten and might spoil. The husband felt it was his to save. The key here is whether the author had the right to take it without checking. \n\nIn similar situations, people often feel ownership when they've reserved something for a later purpose. Even if it was initially shared, once someone sets aside their portion for a specific time, others might consider it their responsibility to check before taking. The author's defense about shelf life is valid, but if the couple had an understanding that they each get two, maybe the husband's saving one for later wasn't communicated clearly. However, the author could have just asked if he wanted to eat it or if she should take it. Since she didn't, it's more on her to have checked. \n\nThe bet adds a layer of gambleness, but the main issue is the act of taking without asking. The husband's reaction shows it was important to him, and the author's insensitivity comes from not considering his perspective. So, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't check and assumed it was okay to take his reserved item.\n"
