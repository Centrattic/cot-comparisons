Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. The situation involves a bet where the outcome depends on the community's reaction.\n\nFirst, the key points: They usually split the cupcakes, each getting two. The husband had one left, and the wife ate it, not knowing he was saving it for a project celebration. He was upset, feeling it was his to save. The wife's reasoning is about the cupcakes' shelf life and responsibility to eat before they go bad.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he saved his cupcake for a specific reason (celebration), and the wife didn't check with him, assuming he didn't want it. The wife argues it was about expiration and they should have eaten it before it spoiled.\n\nNow, considering typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, community often looks at intentions and communication. The wife didn't communicate her action, even though they had a usual agreement. However, the husband didn't mention he was saving it, so maybe the wife acted on a reasonable assumption based on past behavior. But since there's a bet involved, the stakes are higher. The wife didn't check with him, which is a point against her. However, the cupcakes were likely to expire, so maybe she had a valid reason. \n\nBut in many of these cases, the person who doesn't communicate their plans and assumes they can take something that the other person might need is seen as at fault. The wife didn't check, even though there's a possibility he wanted to save it. The husband's reaction suggests he expected her to check. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't communicate her action despite knowing the cupcakes were a shared resource and the bet.\n"
