Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for their husband. The context is that they bought a four-pack, split into two each. They ate theirs, he had one, left his second in the fridge. She ate his leftover one, not knowing he saved it for a celebration. Now he's upset.\n\nHmm. The question is about whether the author is the asshole. On one side, cupcakes do expire, so maybe she was right to eat it before it went bad. But he wanted to save it for a personal reason. The user's argument is that she didn't check with him, while her side is that she thought it was just a leftover and it was about to go bad.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, maybe she should've communicated better. They usually split them evenly, but maybe she should have asked if he wanted to keep his second one. Since he was saving it for something, she didn't consider that. On the other hand, he didn't mention his plan to save it either. But the key point is whether she overstepped by eating his cupcake without checking. \n\nThe outcome is that he was upset, and she might have been insensitive. So, even though the cupcakes have a shelf life, it's about respecting his choice. If he chose to save it, then eating it without asking was her fault. So probably the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
