Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. So, the situation is that they usually split the cupcakes they buy, two each. The husband had one left, and the author ate it. Now he's upset because he was saving it for a celebration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that the cupcakes had a shelf life, and leaving them for five days was risky. She might have thought it was better to eat it before it goes bad. On the other hand, the husband was saving it for a specific reason, so he felt it was his to eat when he wanted. \n\nThe key points here are about shared resources and unspoken agreements. They usually split them, so maybe there's an expectation that each person's portion is their own. The author didn't check with him before eating his cupcake, which he might have found disrespectful. But she might argue that it was a practical decision to avoid waste.\n\nNow, considering the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format, the community usually looks at whether the person was inconsiderate or broke an understood agreement. The husband's reaction suggests he felt it was his, and the author didn't consider that. Even though the cupcakes had a shelf life, maybe there was an unspoken rule to not eat each other's portions without checking. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because she assumed she could take his cupcake without asking, even if it was for a practical reason. The husband's side is about respecting personal choices, even if they're part of a shared item. So, the answer might lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong. But there's also a practical angle about food waste. However, in relationships, communication is key. If there was a prior agreement to split them, then each person's cupcake is theirs unless discussed otherwise. So not checking could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the majority view would be that the author should have checked with her husband before eating his cupcake, even if she thought it was going bad. So the answer is A.\n"
