Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for her husband. The author bought four cupcakes, they each usually get two. She ate both of hers on the first day, her husband had one, and the second one was left in the fridge. The author ate the last one because she thought he didn't want it anymore. But the husband was saving it for a work project celebration, and he was upset.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that cupcakes have a shelf life, and five days in the fridge is pushing it. So she thought it was better to eat it before it goes bad. But from the husband's perspective, it was his cupcake to save, and the author should have checked with him first. \n\nThe usual expectation when sharing something like this is maybe mutual agreement. If they usually split them, maybe there's an understanding that leftovers should be communicated about. The author didn't check with him before eating the last one. Even though she might have thought it was going to waste, not communicating could be a problem. \n\nThe husband's reaction was emotional, which might indicate that he felt disrespected or that the author didn't consider his feelings. The author admits she was insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author tried to prevent waste, on the other hand, she didn't check with her husband first. The husband had a valid expectation of saving it for his celebration. \n\nI think the key point here is the communication. If they had discussed it beforehand, maybe they could have agreed on who gets the last one. Since the author assumed he didn't need it, without verifying, she might be in the wrong. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, so the author shouldn't have taken it without asking. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. She didn't communicate, and the husband had his own plans for the cupcake. Even though there's a valid point about the shelf life, the main issue is about respecting his ownership and not checking in.\n"
