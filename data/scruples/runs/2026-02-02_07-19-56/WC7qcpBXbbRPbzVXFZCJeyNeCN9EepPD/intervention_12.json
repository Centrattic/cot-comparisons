Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. The context is that the cupcakes were bought in a four-pack, each of them usually eats two. The author ate both of hers, the husband had one, and the remaining one was left in the fridge. The author ate the last one, not knowing the husband had plans to save it for a project celebration. Now, the husband is upset, and they have a bet on who's the asshole.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about ownership and communication. The author thought the cupcake was left uneaten, so she took it. The husband felt it was his and was upset. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the cupcakes were bought as a shared purchase. They usually split them, so each gets two. The husband had one left, and the author ate the last one. The question is whether the author should have checked with him before eating it. The husband's argument is that since it was his cupcake, she shouldn't eat it without asking. The author's defense is that the cupcake was perishing and one of them should eat it before it goes bad.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if it was a shared purchase, once they split the cupcakes, each person's portion is theirs. The husband might have intended to save his second one, but he didn't communicate that. However, the author didn't check if he still wanted it. The husband's being upset is valid because he had plans to save it. But the author didn't know that, so maybe she had a right to assume it was fair game since it was in the fridge.\n\nBut maybe the key is that even if it's shared, once you assign each person's share, you should respect their ownership. So if the husband had his own cupcake, the author shouldn't have eaten it without asking. Even though the cupcakes were shared, the individual portions are now each person's property. So eating someone else's food without asking is generally considered wrong, especially when they had plans to use it. The author didn't consider the husband's intentions, even if those intentions weren't communicated. So maybe the author is at fault for not respecting his ownership of the cupcake.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband didn't communicate that he wanted to save it, so the author might have a point in thinking it was fair game. But in relationships, people usually expect communication about shared items. The husband might be expected to mention if he wants to save something, but the author should have checked. The balance here is tricky. However, the author's action was taking something that the husband had set aside, even if unknowingly, so that could be seen as taking without permission. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
