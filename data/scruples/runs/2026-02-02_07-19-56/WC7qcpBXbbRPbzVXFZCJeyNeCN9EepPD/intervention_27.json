Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. \n\nFirst, the setup: She bought four cupcakes, each of them usually eats two. She had eaten both hers on day one, he had one. The next day, she noticed his second cupcake in the fridge and ate it. He was upset because he was saving it for a project celebration.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's reasoning: cupcakes have a shelf life, they were in the fridge for five days, so she thought it was better to eat it before it goes bad. The husband's side: it was his cupcake, so she shouldn't have eaten it without checking.\n\nHmm. The author ate his cupcake. Even if the cupcakes were going bad, he had the right to his own cupcake. The usual arrangement was that each gets two, and he had one left. By eating his remaining cupcake, she took something that belonged to him. Even if she thought it was getting stale, he might have wanted to eat it on purpose. She didn't check with him, which is a key point. The husband's upset reaction suggests he did want to keep it for a specific reason. The author's action was taking something that was his without permission, which is inconsiderate. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. The cupcakes were shared? The original purchase was a four-pack, but they each take two. So maybe it's a shared resource, but once they're assigned, they belong to each person. The author ate her own two, then took his. So, if he didn't use his, maybe she shouldn't have. The husband did save one for a later time, which is his choice. The author's assumption that he wouldn't want it anymore just because it was in the fridge is where the problem is. She should have communicated instead of assuming. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the author took something that belonged to her husband without asking. Even if the cupcakes were getting old, it's his decision to consume or discard his own cupcake. The husband's reaction shows he had a different plan for it. The author's inconsiderate action led to his disappointment. Therefore, she is in the wrong for not respecting his ownership and not checking with him. So the answer should be A.\n"
