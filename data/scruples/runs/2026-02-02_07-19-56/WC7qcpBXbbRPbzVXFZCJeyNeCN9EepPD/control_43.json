Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author bought four cupcakes, each of them usually eats two. The husband had one left in the fridge, and the author ate it. The husband was saving it for a project completion, and he was upset when he found out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for eating the cupcake without checking. The husband's side is that it was his, and the author should have asked. The author's defense is that the cupcakes were perishable and about to go bad, so someone should eat it. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband had the cupcake in the fridge, implying he might have wanted to save it. The author might have assumed it wasn't needed, but maybe they should have communicated better. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the cupcake was going bad, maybe the right move was to check with the husband first. The author didn't consider the husband's intention to save it for a celebration. The husband's reaction shows it was important to him. \n\nSo, while both sides have points, the husband's side argues that the agreement was to split them, and he had a specific plan for his remaining cupcake. The author didn't respect that by eating it without asking. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not checking. Answer A.\n"
