Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a cupcake. The author bought a four-pack, split it with her husband, ate her two first, then noticed his second one was still in the fridge and ate that. Her husband was saving it for a victory celebration but found out it was eaten. He got upset.\n\nSo, first, the key points here are about shared items and communication. They usually split the cupcakes, right? So she ate both her own, and he had one. His second one was left in the fridge. She decided to eat it without checking, thinking it might go bad. He was saving it for a specific reason, which she didn't consider.\n\nThe author's defense is that cupcakes have a shelf life and leaving them for five days was risky. Her husband's argument is that it was his cupcake, and she shouldn't eat it without checking. \n\nHmm. The main issue is whether it's okay to take someone else's food without asking, even if you think it's going to expire. The user thinks the author is wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the cupcakes were part of a shared purchase, so maybe they were considered communal items. But if they split them into individual portions, each one is their own. If her husband left his in the fridge, maybe he expected to eat it later. The author's assumption that he didn't want it anymore might be incorrect. Even if the cupcakes could spoil, the husband had the right to save his own. The author didn't check with him first, which is a key point. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's property and considering the other's feelings is important. The husband was saving it for a special occasion. The author didn't ask, just took it. That could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the cupcakes were going to expire, the husband might have wanted to eat it before that. The author's action led to disappointment. \n\nBut there's also the argument that food can spoil, and maybe the husband forgot. However, the expectation was that each had two, and the husband's cupcake was his to save. The author taking it without communication could be the problem. So, the answer is likely AITA here. The author should have checked with her husband first. \n\nThe user says the author is wrong, so the answer should be A.\n"
