Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: They bought four cupcakes, each usually gets two. The author ate both of hers on the first day, the husband ate one of his. The next day, the husband's second cupcake was still in the fridge. The author ate it, thinking he didn't want it anymore. The husband was upset because he was saving it for a celebration. The stakes are high for them\u2014either he goes real estate shopping with her or she does something she'd rather not do.\n\nSo, the main points here are about shared items and communication. The author assumed that since his cupcake was in the fridge for five days, he didn't need it. But the husband had a different plan for it. The question is whether the author was wrong for eating it without checking.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that it was his cupcake, and even if it was in the fridge, it was his to use as he wished. The author's defense is that the cupcake was perishing and she didn't want it to go to waste. Also, they usually split them equally, so maybe she thought it was okay to take it when she saw it was left.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if they usually split the cupcakes, once the husband had his own, eating his cupcake without checking might be an issue. The husband's plan to save it for a celebration was his personal choice, and the author didn't consider that. Maybe she should have asked if he wanted to keep it or if it was okay to eat. The assumption that he didn't want it because it was in the fridge might not be valid. People sometimes save food for later, even if it's already in the fridge.\n\nSo, the key point is communication. The author didn't check with her husband, and he was upset. Even if the cupcake was going bad, maybe there's a better way to handle it\u2014like a discussion. The husband's reaction shows he valued that cupcake for a specific reason, which the author didn't consider. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they both contributed to the cupcakes, so it's a shared resource. But once assigned, maybe each person's portion is theirs. The author ate her own, but the husband's was his. So eating his without permission could be seen as taking without asking.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't communicate her intentions, which led to hurt feelings. Even if the cupcake was about to expire, the husband's feelings matter. The author's insensitivity in not taking his feelings seriously is a problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't check with her husband, even if she thought she had a good reason. The husband's feelings are valid, and the author should have considered that his cupcake might not be leftovers to be eaten by her.\n"
