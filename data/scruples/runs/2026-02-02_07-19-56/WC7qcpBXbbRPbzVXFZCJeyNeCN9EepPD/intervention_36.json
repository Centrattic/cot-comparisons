Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for their husband. Both sides have points.\n\nFirst, the author bought a four-pack, intending each to have two. They ate both of theirs on day one, and the husband had one. The second cupcake was left in the fridge. The author then ate it, not knowing the husband was saving it for a celebration. The husband got upset when he found out.\n\nThe author's defense is that cupcakes don't last forever, and they didn't want it to go bad. The husband argues it was his, and the author should have checked. \n\nHmm. So, the key points here are ownership and communication. The author assumed the cupcake was up for grabs since it wasn't eaten yet. But maybe the husband had a different plan. Even though the author thought it was to be shared, once the husband had one left, maybe he intended to save it. The author didn't ask, which could be the issue. \n\nBut the original agreement was to split the four-pack. If both were supposed to have two, and the husband only ate one, maybe the author had the right to take the remaining one. However, the husband's intention to save it for a celebration wasn't communicated. So maybe the author should have checked? The husband's reaction suggests he felt his personal item was taken without permission.\n\nBut then again, the cupcakes were a shared purchase. If they both agreed to split them, but the husband didn't eat his second one in time, maybe the author was justified in using it before it spoiled. However, in relationships, respecting boundaries is important. Even if it's a shared item, if the husband had a specific plan, the author should have communicated or asked.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The author didn't communicate, but neither did the husband. The husband might have been inconsiderate for not eating his cupcake before. But the act of taking it without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for not checking, but the husband also didn't eat his own cupcake, which might be on him. However, in terms of the question, the author is the one who took the cupcake without permission. Since they have a rule of splitting them, but the husband didn't finish his, maybe the author had the right to take it. But since it was his to save, maybe the author should have respected that. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because even if the cupcake was there, taking it without checking could be seen as not respecting the husband's ownership of his half. The husband's reaction shows he felt it was his, so the author should have asked. So answer A.\n"
