Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ate the last cupcake is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author bought four cupcakes, each had two. The author ate both theirs, husband had one each day. The second day, the husband's remaining cupcake was in the fridge, and the author ate it. The husband was saving it for a project celebration. The author thought it was going to expire, but the husband was upset.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author and husband usually split the cupcakes. The author ate their two, husband ate one, left one. The author then ate the husband's leftover cupcake. The husband was saving it for a specific reason. The author's defense is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they didn't want it to go bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake and the author should have checked.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the husband didn't specify that he was saving the cupcake. But the usual practice was that each had two. The author ate both their own, and then ate one of the husband's. If they usually split two each, maybe the author assumed that the remaining cupcake was theirs to eat. But the husband had a different intention. The author didn't check with him, even though he might have wanted to save it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the cupcake would go bad, but the husband had it in the fridge for five days. If it's still safe, maybe the author overstepped by taking it without asking. The husband's upset reaction suggests he valued it more as a celebration. The author's actions were maybe thoughtless, even if they thought it was going bad. They could have asked if he still wanted it. So, the author might be in the wrong for not checking, even if the intention was to prevent waste. \n\nBut some might argue that since the husband didn't mention saving it, the author had no way of knowing. However, given the context, maybe the husband expected the same routine, so the author should have confirmed. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being at fault for not communicating.\n"
