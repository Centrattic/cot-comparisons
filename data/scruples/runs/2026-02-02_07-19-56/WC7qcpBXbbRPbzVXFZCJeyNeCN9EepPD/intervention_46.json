Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be shared with their husband. The author bought a four-pack, each took two, the husband had one left in the fridge, and the author ate it without asking. The husband was upset because he wanted to save it for a celebration.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author's argument is that the cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was risky, so someone should eat it before it goes bad. The husband's side is that the cupcake was his and the author didn't check with him first.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the typical expectations in such a scenario. When you split something, especially food, it's usually assumed that you each get to keep your share. The author ate their own cupcakes first, which is fine, but the husband's remaining cupcake was supposed to be his. Even if it was about to expire, the husband had the right to decide what to do with his own cupcake. The author's assumption that it was okay to eat it because maybe he didn't want it anymore might be a bit presumptuous. People might have different priorities, like saving it for a special occasion. \n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. The author didn't ask, which led to the husband's hurt feelings. Even if the cupcakes were going bad, the husband might have had a reason to keep it. The author could have offered to check or maybe shared it with him, but taking it without permission seems disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, cupcakes in the fridge for five days might not be at their best, so the author might have thought it was a waste. But the husband's intention to save it for a project celebration adds emotional value beyond just the food. The author didn't consider that the cupcake was part of his celebration. \n\nSo, even though the cupcakes were perishable, the husband's ownership and the lack of communication make the author the asshole here. The answer is A.\n"
