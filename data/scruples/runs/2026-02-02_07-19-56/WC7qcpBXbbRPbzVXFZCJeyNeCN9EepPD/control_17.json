Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author bought four cupcakes, and they usually split them two each. The husband had one left in the fridge. The author ate it because they thought it was about to expire. The husband was upset because he wanted to save it for a project celebration. \n\nSo, the author's defense is that the cupcake was going bad and they wanted to prevent waste. The husband feels it was his cupcake and the author should have checked first. \n\nNow, considering typical perspectives. In relationships, shared items can lead to assumptions. The author might have thought it was okay since they usually split them, but maybe the husband's not eating his first one meant he intended to save the second one for later. The author didn't check, which could be seen as not respecting his intention. \n\nBut then, the cupcakes do have a shelf life. The author might not have known the husband was saving it, and it's reasonable to assume that if it's not eaten, it should be consumed before it goes bad. \n\nHowever, the key point here is that there was an unspoken agreement. The husband was saving his for a specific reason, and the author didn't consider that. The husband's reaction was hurt, so maybe the author was a bit inconsiderate. \n\nBut the stakes are pretty high for both sides. The author didn't eat it out of malice; it was more about preventing waste. The husband had the chance to mention his plans earlier. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether it's the author's responsibility to check or if the husband should have communicated his intent to save it. Since the author ate it without confirming, maybe they are at fault. But it's a minor social transgression. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often expect communication. If you're saving something, you might want to mention it. So the author might not be entirely wrong, but they did act without considering the husband's possible plans. \n\nSo I'm leaning towards the author being a little in the wrong because they didn't check, even though they had a valid reason. The husband should have communicated, but the author could have asked. So Answer A.\n"
