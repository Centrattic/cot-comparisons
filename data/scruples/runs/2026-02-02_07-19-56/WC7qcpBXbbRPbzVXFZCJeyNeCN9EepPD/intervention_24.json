Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ate the last cupcake that was supposed to be shared with her husband, and now they're in a bet where if the community sides with her, he has to go real estate shopping with her, and if he wins, she has to do something with her mouth that's not mentioned here. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author bought a four-pack of gourmet cupcakes, intending for each to have two. She ate both of hers on the first day, and her husband had one. The second one he didn't eat, so she took it. She argues that the cupcakes had a shelf life and she didn't want them to go bad. Her husband says it was his and she should have checked with him first.\n\nThe key points here are about shared items and communication. When people share something, especially when it's agreed upon, there's an expectation that each person will stick to their share unless communicated otherwise. The author knew the cupcakes were bought for both, so she might have assumed he had enough, but maybe she didn't consider that he might have a specific reason to save one. He was saving it for a celebration, which could be important to him. \n\nThe author's reasoning is practical (preventing waste), but her husband's emotional reaction suggests it wasn't just about the cupcake\u2014it might have been about the sentiment or the unspoken agreement. The fact that she didn't check with him shows a lack of communication. Even if he was saving it, she could have asked if he wanted to eat it that day instead of taking it without permission. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences and boundaries is crucial. The husband's argument is that it was his to begin with, and she shouldn't have eaten it without asking. The author's justification is valid in a literal sense, but the social expectation might be that once an item is divided, each person's share is their own. However, if there was an agreement to split them, maybe the husband's expectation to keep one was part of an unspoken deal. \n\nThe user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, so I need to see if that's supported. The husband's upset reaction and the bet's stakes might tip the balance in his favor. Also, the author acknowledged that she was insensitive for not taking him seriously. That's a red flag. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's action of eating the cupcake without checking, despite the prior agreement, was a breach of understanding. Even if the cupcakes were about to expire, the husband had the right to have his own preference. The author should have considered that and communicated. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
