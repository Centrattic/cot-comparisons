Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband. The author bought four cupcakes, each had two. The husband had one left, and the author ate it without asking. The husband was saving it for a project celebration and was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they didn't want it to go bad. They also mention that usually, they each get two, and they both ate their shares. The husband didn't mention wanting to save his second one, so the author assumed it wasn't needed anymore. However, the husband had a specific reason to save it, so he was disappointed.\n\nSo, the key points are: shared purchase, usual practice of splitting, but in this case, one person had an unspoken intention to save theirs. The author didn't communicate or check before taking it. While the cupcakes might spoil, the husband had a reason to keep it. The author's action might be seen as not respecting the husband's ownership of his own cupcake, even if it was part of a shared purchase. \n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? If the usual practice was to split them, but the husband had a change of plan without communicating, maybe it's on him. However, the author could have asked instead of just eating it. The question is about respecting boundaries. Even if it's a small thing, the husband's intention wasn't communicated, but the author could have considered possible reasons for it being left. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have been inconsiderate by not checking, even if they thought it was a good idea. On the other hand, the husband should have communicated his plan. But the author's action breached mutual understanding. So maybe the author is slightly in the wrong. The answer might be A.\n"
