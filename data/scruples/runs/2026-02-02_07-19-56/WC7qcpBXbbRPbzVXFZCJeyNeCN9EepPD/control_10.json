Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author ate the last cupcake that was supposed to be shared with her husband. The cupcakes had a shelf life, and she figured since his was still in the fridge after five days, he wasn't going to eat it. She ate it without asking. Her husband was upset because he had saved it for a work celebration.\n\nSo the key points here. The original agreement was they each get two cupcakes. She ate both of hers, he ate one. The second one was in the fridge. She ate it without checking. He felt it was his and was upset. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From her side, she thought it was about to go bad and didn't want it to waste. From his side, it was his to save, and she should have checked. \n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, she did not communicate and made an assumption. Even if the cupcake was going to expire, she could have asked. On the other hand, the husband didn't eat it yet, so maybe he had a reason. But the problem is that the original deal was splitting them, so maybe she had the right to her two, and the remaining one was his. But she ate the last one without considering his possible intention to save it. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She didn't ask, so she made an assumption. Even if her reasoning was that it might go bad, she could have just asked. So maybe she's in the wrong because she didn't consider his feelings and didn't communicate. However, the husband could have eaten it earlier. But the main issue is the lack of communication. \n\nSo I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't check with her husband before eating his cupcake, even if she had a reason. The husband's reaction shows that it meant something to him, so she should have at least discussed it.\n"
