Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for the husband. The writer bought four cupcakes, they each usually get two. The husband had one left in the fridge, and the writer ate it without checking. The husband was saving it for a project celebration and felt hurt.\n\nSo, the key points here. The writer says they figured the husband didn't want it because it wasn't eaten yet. But the husband had a specific reason to keep it. The writer's defense is that the cupcakes have a shelf life, so they should be eaten before going bad. The husband's point is that it was his cupcake, and the writer should have checked with him first.\n\nHmm. The writer didn't consider that the husband might have a reason to keep his cupcake. Even though it's a small thing, the husband was saving it for a specific celebration. The writer acted on their assumption that the cupcake was being left behind, but that assumption was wrong. So, the writer didn't communicate, which led to the husband feeling upset. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the cupcakes were about to expire, the better approach would be to ask the husband about it instead of assuming. The writer's action was inconsiderate because they didn't check, leading to the husband's disappointment. So, even though it's a minor issue, the writer made an assumption that caused hurt feelings. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The writer should have checked with the husband before eating his cupcake. The husband had a valid reason to save it, and the writer's lack of communication led to the problem. The writer's justification about the shelf life doesn't override the importance of respecting the husband's intention. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
