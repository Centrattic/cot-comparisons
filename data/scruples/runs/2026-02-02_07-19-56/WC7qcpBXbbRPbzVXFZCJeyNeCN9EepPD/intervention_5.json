Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ate the last cupcake is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought four cupcakes, each usually gets two. The husband had one left, and the author ate it without asking. The husband was saving it for a celebration.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they should eat it before it goes bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author might have thought it was a shared purchase and that it was okay to eat the remaining one since it was going bad. On the other, the husband had a specific plan to use it later, so the author's action might have disrupted that. \n\nThe key points here are communication and ownership. The author assumed they could eat the cupcake without asking, which might be seen as not respecting the husband's ownership. Even if the cupcakes were split between them, the husband might have had the right to save his for a later time. The author's failure to check could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the context mentions that a lot rides on the outcome, which might add tension, but that doesn't excuse the action. The husband was clearly hurt, which is a strong indicator that the author's action was wrong. \n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions, not checking and eating someone else's reserved item could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
