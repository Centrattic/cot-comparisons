Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. The context is that they bought a four-pack, each usually gets two. The author ate both of her cupcakes on the first day, her husband had one. Then the next day, she ate the remaining one from his that was in the fridge, not knowing he was saving it for a project celebration.\n\nFirst, the key points. They have an unspoken agreement to split the cupcakes. The husband saved his second one, not knowing the author would eat it. She thought it was going to expire, so she ate it. He got upset because he was saving it. The stakes are a bit high because they're using this as a game to decide who does what over the weekend.\n\nSo, the author's defense is that the cupcakes were about to expire, so she took initiative. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and she should have checked. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the unspoken agreement might be that each gets two, but if one is saving theirs for later, maybe they should communicate. The author didn't ask, but she might have thought it was past its prime. However, even if it was in the fridge, maybe the husband's intention to save it should have been respected. \n\nBut then again, if they usually split them and the remaining cupcake wasn't marked, maybe she wasn't wrong to assume it was fair game. The husband didn't mention saving it, so she might not be in the wrong for not knowing. However, maybe she should have checked. \n\nThe stakes are high, but the situation is trivial (a cupcake leading to a game). The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top, but the author could have been more considerate. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author acted without knowing the husband's intention and whether the unspoken agreement was clear. Since the husband didn't communicate that he was saving it, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the fact that the husband had already set aside his second cupcake and she ate it without asking could indicate she was wrong. But the expiration is a valid point too. \n\nHmm. The community often leans towards considering communication. If the husband didn't communicate, maybe the author isn't the asshole. But the fact that she ate it without checking could make her the asshole. It's a tough call. Maybe A is the answer here because she should have asked. But some might say B. I need to decide based on typical AITA standards. Usually, if someone else's intent is unclear, but there's an unspoken agreement, the person acting without checking might be considered in the wrong. So maybe A.\n"
