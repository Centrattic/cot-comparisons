Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about eating the last cupcake meant for the husband. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple usually splits the cupcakes, two each. The author ate both of their cupcakes on day one, and the husband had one, leaving one in the fridge. The author then ate the remaining one without asking, thinking the husband didn't want it. The husband was upset because he had saved it for a celebration.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared items and communication. The author's reasoning is that the cupcakes would go bad, so someone should eat them. The husband's side is that it was his to decide. \n\nBut traditionally, when you buy something for a household, it's considered shared unless specified. However, if they had an unspoken agreement that each gets two, then maybe the husband expected to save his own. The author didn't check, which might be the issue. The husband's reaction was hurt, which shows it was a personal thing for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known about the husband's intention to save it. The cupcakes were in the fridge, and maybe it was a mistake to assume they were fair game. But the husband didn't communicate his plan. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author didn't take responsibility for not discussing it. The husband's feelings are valid, but maybe the author should have asked. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the husband had a right to his cupcake, and the author ate it without checking, even if it was out of consideration for the shelf life, not checking could be seen as the mistake. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong). But some might argue that it's a minor issue and the husband should have communicated. But the husband's reaction was strong, and the author's action was the trigger. I think the author is in the wrong because even if there was an agreement, they should have checked in before eating the last one. So the answer would be A.\n"
