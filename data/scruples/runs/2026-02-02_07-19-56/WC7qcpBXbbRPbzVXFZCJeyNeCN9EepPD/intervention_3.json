Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband.\n\nFirst, the context: The author bought four cupcakes, each usually takes two. They ate their two on the first day, and the husband had one. The second cupcake he had was left in the fridge. The author ate it, not knowing he saved it for a project celebration. Now, the husband is upset, and they made a bet on who would do what based on the community's response.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was pushing it, so they thought they should eat it before it goes bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked with him first.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about shared items and communication. The author bought the cupcakes together, so maybe they assumed they were shared. But the husband saved his for later, expecting it to be there. The author didn't check with him, even though they knew he had one left. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because even if the cupcakes were shared, once the husband had his own, the author should have respected his decision to save it. Not checking first could be seen as inconsiderate. Plus, the husband had a specific reason for saving it, which the author wasn't aware of. The author could have just asked if he wanted it or if it was okay to eat. Not doing that shows a lack of communication. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
