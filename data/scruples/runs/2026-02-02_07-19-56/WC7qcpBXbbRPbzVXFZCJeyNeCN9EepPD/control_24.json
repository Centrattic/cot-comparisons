Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for the husband. They bought a four-pack, each usually gets two. The person ate both of their own, and the husband had one. The second one was left in the fridge. The person then ate it, not knowing the husband had saved it for a celebration. Now they have to decide if the person is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's reasoning: cupcakes have a shelf life, and since it was in the fridge for five days, they thought it might go bad. They figured the husband didn't want it anymore since he didn't eat it. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author shouldn't have eaten it without checking.\n\nSo, the key points here. They usually split the cupcakes, each taking two. The person ate their two, husband ate one. The second cupcake was left. The author ate it because they thought it's about to expire. But the husband was saving it for a celebration. The question is whether the author should have checked first or not.\n\nIs it okay to assume that if the husband didn't eat it in five days, he doesn't need it anymore? Maybe not. Because maybe he had a specific reason to save it. The author didn't communicate, which led to the husband feeling upset. The husband's cupcake was in the fridge, so maybe the author should have asked instead of assuming. Even though cupcakes do go bad, the husband had a reason to keep it. The author's action, while understandable from a practical standpoint, didn't consider the husband's feelings or his intention to save it.\n\nBut then again, the author might not have known. The couple had a usual arrangement, so the author might have thought it's part of their usual split. If the husband didn't eat his second one, maybe the author assumed it's okay to eat it. However, since the husband was saving it for a specific reason, the author should have checked first. Communication is key here. The author didn't check, leading to the problem. So maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong.\n\nBut is it a clear-cut case? The author might argue that they were just trying to prevent waste. But the husband valued the cupcake for a celebration, which is a personal choice. The author didn't ask, so even if their intention was to avoid waste, they didn't consider the husband's perspective. So perhaps the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and acted on their own assumption, which led to the husband's disappointment.\n"
