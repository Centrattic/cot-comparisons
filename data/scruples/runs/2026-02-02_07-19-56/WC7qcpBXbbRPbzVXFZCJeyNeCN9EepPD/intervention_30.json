Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake meant for her husband. \n\nFirst, the context: They bought four cupcakes, each usually had two. The husband had one of his two, and the second was left in the fridge. The author ate it, not knowing he was saving it for a project celebration. Now, there's a bet on what each of them has to do if they win the AITA vote.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author made a mistake. From the husband's perspective, he saved his second cupcake for a specific reason, and the author ate it without asking. The author's defense is that the cupcakes were perishing and one should eat it before it goes bad. \n\nBut here's the thing: When they bought the cupcakes, they had an agreement to split them, two each. If the husband wanted to save his second cupcake, he should have communicated that. If the author didn't know, maybe she had a right to assume he wasn't going to eat it. However, once the husband had one left, maybe the author should have checked if he wanted to keep it instead of just eating it. \n\nThe key point is about communication. The husband didn't mention he was saving it, so the author might not have known. But if it's their usual routine to split the cupcakes, the husband could have indicated that he wanted to keep the second one. The author ate it out of hunger, thinking it was going to expire, but the husband had a different intention. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if both parties share something, there's an unspoken agreement to respect each other's wishes. The author might have assumed ownership, but the husband had an unspoken plan. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the author didn't consider the husband's possible intention to save it, even though he didn't communicate it. But in the absence of communication, the author's action might be understandable. \n\nBut the husband's upset reaction suggests that he had a reason to save it. If the author had asked, she could have known. Maybe the author should have checked. However, the cupcakes were perishable, so maybe it's reasonable to eat them before they go bad. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have communicated. Since the husband didn't mention he was saving it, the author might not be wrong. But if the husband's intention was to save, and the author ate it without considering that, maybe she's in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the author made a mistake by not checking, even if the cupcakes were about to expire. The husband's reaction was a bit over the top, but the author had the opportunity to ask. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
