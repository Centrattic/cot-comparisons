Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for their husband. They bought a four-pack, each got two. They ate both theirs on day one, and the husband had one on the first day. The second cupcake was left in the fridge, and the author ate it the next day because they thought the husband didn't want it anymore. The husband was saving it for a work project celebration and was upset. \n\nSo, the main points are: cupcakes have a shelf life, the husband didn't mention saving it, and the author assumed it was okay to eat it when it was going to expire. The husband felt it was his and the author should have checked.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author might think since they split the cupcakes originally, and the husband didn't eat his second one, it was fair game. But the husband had a specific reason to save it. The author didn't communicate with him about it. But the cupcakes were going bad, so maybe the husband should have eaten it earlier or communicated better. \n\nThe author didn't ask, but the husband didn't indicate he was saving it. The author might not be in the wrong because the cupcake was about to expire and the husband didn't use it. But maybe the husband's feelings are valid because he had a plan. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have asked, but the husband didn't specify. The author's argument is about shelf life, which is valid. But the husband's argument is about ownership. \n\nI think it's a bit of a toss-up, but since the author didn't check and the husband had a specific reason, maybe the author is a bit in the wrong. However, the husband didn't use the cupcake in time. It's a 50-50. But the answer options are A or B. Since the author didn't check, maybe they're in the wrong. But the husband didn't communicate. I think it's a B, the author isn't in the wrong because the cupcake was going bad and the husband didn't use it. But maybe the husband should have eaten it earlier. So, B.\n"
