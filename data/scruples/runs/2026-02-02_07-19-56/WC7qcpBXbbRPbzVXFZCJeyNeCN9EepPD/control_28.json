Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. The situation involves a game where the outcome depends on the community's vote, which adds some pressure.\n\nFirst, the author bought a four-pack of cupcakes, and they usually each have two. She ate both hers on the first day, her husband ate one, and the second was left in the fridge. The key point is that the husband saved his cupcake for a project celebration, but the author consumed it without checking.\n\nThe author argues that cupcakes have a shelf life, and leaving it in the fridge for five days was risky. She assumed he didn't want it since he didn't mention it. The husband, however, was upset because he planned to save it for a specific reason. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author didn't communicate her intent to eat the cupcake. Even if cupcakes might go bad, it's a shared item where both have a claim. The husband's feelings of betrayal might matter here. The author didn't check if he wanted to use it, so she might be in the wrong. However, she might not have known his plan. But since it's his cupcake, maybe she should have confirmed.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because even if the cupcake was going to expire, the husband had a specific intention. The author's assumption that he didn't need it led her to take it without communication. The husband's perspective is valid here, so the author might be the asshole.\n"
