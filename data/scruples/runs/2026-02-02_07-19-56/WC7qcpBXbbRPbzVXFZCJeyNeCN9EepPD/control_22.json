Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about eating the last cupcake meant for the husband.\n\nFirst, the author bought a four-pack of cupcakes and they usually split them two each. She ate both of hers on the first day, and the husband had one. Then, she noticed his second cupcake was still in the fridge and ate it. The husband was saving it for a work project celebration. He was upset when he found out.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they were about to go bad, so someone should eat them. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and she should have checked with him first.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nDid she have a prior agreement? They usually split them two each, so maybe there was an expectation that each person's cupcakes are their own. If he saved his for later, she might have assumed he didn't want it if it wasn't eaten the first day. But maybe that assumption was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, she might have thought it was okay to eat it to prevent waste. On the other hand, if he had a specific plan to use it for a celebration, then she didn't consider his feelings. The key here is communication. If she didn't check with him first, even if she thought it would go bad, maybe she should have asked. \n\nAlso, the context of the bet is important here. The outcome of this argument affects bigger plans. Maybe she should have been more considerate, given the stakes. The husband's reaction being that of a \"hurt little boy\" suggests that he felt disrespected or unappreciated. \n\nBut then again, cupcakes are perishable. If she thought it was about to go bad, maybe it's reasonable to eat it. However, the fact that they had a routine of splitting them might mean that each person's portion is theirs, so even if one isn't eaten immediately, it's still their possession. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might argue that she was being practical, but the husband might feel his ownership was disregarded. The answer could hinge on whether the expectation was that any unused cupcakes are up for grabs or if they're each person's own once assigned. \n\nSince the husband was saving it for a specific reason, the author didn't consider that possibility. So, maybe she was wrong in not checking, even if she thought it would go bad. The answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't communicate and assumed his intentions. But if the default is that they split and each owns their own, then maybe B (not wrong). \n\nBut given that they had a routine, and she took his without asking, it's more likely A. Also, the fact that he was saving it for a celebration adds to the reason why she should have checked. So the answer is A.\n"
