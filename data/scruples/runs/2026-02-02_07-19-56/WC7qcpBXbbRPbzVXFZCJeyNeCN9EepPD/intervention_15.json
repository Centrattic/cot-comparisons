Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. I need to figure out if the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author bought a four-pack of cupcakes, split them so each gets two. She ate both of hers on the first day, her husband ate one. Then, the next day, she noticed his second cupcake was still in the fridge, and since they were near the end of their shelf life, she ate it. He was upset because he was saving it for a project celebration. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about ownership and communication. When they split the cupcakes, they each had two. So she had her two, he had his. The author ate her two, and he only ate one. The remaining cupcake was his, so by eating it without checking, she took something that was his. \n\nEven if the cupcakes were about to expire, that doesn't necessarily mean she had the right to take them. They could have discussed it. The husband's argument is that it was his cupcake. The author's defense is the shelf life, but that's not a strong argument if it's his. Also, she didn't check with him, which is a point in his favor. \n\nHowever, sometimes in households, people might assume leftovers can be shared, but the initial agreement was a split. If he was saving it, then she should have considered that. The fact that he was upset and felt it was his own cupcake suggests that she overstepped. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the cupcakes were a shared purchase, so perhaps they were both allowed to eat them even if they were split. But the initial agreement implies that each person's portion is their own. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I agree. The author took something that was the husband's without consulting him, even if there was a reason. The correct approach would have been to check if he wanted to eat it. So the answer is A.\n"
