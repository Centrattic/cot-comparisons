Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake meant to be saved for her husband.\n\nFirst, the context: They usually split the cupcakes, each getting two. The husband had one left which he was saving. The wife ate it, not knowing he was saving it for a project celebration. Now, there's a bet on who is right.\n\nThe author's defense is that cupcakes have a shelf life, and the cupcake was in the fridge for five days. She might have thought it was about to go bad. But the husband was saving it for a specific reason, and he felt hurt.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The wife didn't check, but the husband didn't communicate that he was saving it. However, since they usually split them, maybe the husband should have mentioned his intention to save it. On the other hand, the wife could have communicated before eating it. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband's project milestone is important, and not being able to celebrate it might be a valid point. The wife's action, while maybe understandable, did overlook the husband's unspoken plan. \n\nSo, the author didn't check, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the husband also didn't clarify his plans. However, the question is about who's in the wrong. Since the wife took the cupcake without asking, even if it was about to expire, it's a matter of respecting the other's wishes. The husband had a specific plan, so the wife's action might be seen as not respecting his choice. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't check with him first, even if she had a reason. The husband's upset reaction shows the importance to him. So the answer would be A (yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
