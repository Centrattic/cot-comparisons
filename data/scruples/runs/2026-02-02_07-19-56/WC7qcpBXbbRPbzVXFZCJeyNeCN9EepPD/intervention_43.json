Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author bought a four-pack of cupcakes, and they usually split them two each. The husband had one left in the fridge, and the author ate it without checking. The husband was saving it for a project celebration. The author's reasoning is that cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was pushing it, so they needed to eat it before it went bad. The husband feels it was his cupcake and the author should have at least checked.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about ownership and communication. The author's argument is that the cupcakes are perishable and they needed to be eaten before they went bad. The husband's argument is that he owned that specific cupcake and the author shouldn't have eaten it without asking.\n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of communication. Even if the cupcakes were split, maybe the husband had a reason to keep his second one for later. The author just went ahead and ate it without confirming if the husband still wanted it. The husband was saving it for a specific event, so maybe he didn't want to eat it yet. The author might have assumed it was okay because it was in the fridge and old, but that doesn't mean the husband didn't still want it. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction was hurt, so even if the author thought it was a shared item, maybe they should have checked first. It's possible both parties could have communicated better. But the author's action of eating it without asking might be seen as not respecting the husband's ownership of that cupcake, even if it was part of a shared pack. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author didn't communicate, made an assumption, and took the cupcake. The husband's side is valid because he had a specific plan for it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not checking first. The answer would be A.\n"
