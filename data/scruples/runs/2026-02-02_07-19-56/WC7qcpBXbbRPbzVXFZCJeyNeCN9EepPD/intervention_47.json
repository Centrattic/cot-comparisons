Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they were in the wrong for eating the last cupcake meant for their husband. The context is that they bought four cupcakes, each usually had two. They ate both of theirs, and the husband had one. The next day, the husband's second cupcake was still in the fridge, so the author ate it. The husband was upset because he was saving it for a project celebration.\n\nHmm. The author's argument is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they didn't want it to go bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked first.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. They usually split them, but maybe the husband had a specific plan for his second one. The author assumed he didn't want it anymore because it was in the fridge. But maybe they should have checked with the husband instead of assuming. Even if the cupcake was close to expiring, if the husband wanted to save it for a reason, eating it without asking might be considered disrespectful or inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not know about the husband's intention to save it. But in a relationship, maybe it's expected to communicate if you have plans for something. If the husband didn't mention he was saving it, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, once the husband expressed his disappointment, the author could have acknowledged his feelings and maybe offered to make it up to him instead of making a game out of it. \n\nSo, the author probably did something inconsiderate by not checking first, even if the cupcake was about to expire. The husband had a right to expect that his cupcake was his, especially if he left it in the fridge. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the husband's possible plans and didn't communicate their intention to eat it.\n"
