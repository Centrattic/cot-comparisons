Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a cupcake that was part of a shared purchase. The user bought four cupcakes, each of them was supposed to get two. The user ate both of their own, and the husband had one. Then the husband had another one left in the fridge, and the user ate it without asking.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was too long, so they wanted to eat it before it spoiled. The husband was saving it as a victory treat for finishing a project and was upset when he found out the user ate it. The user is now asking if they're the asshole because there's a bet on their next action based on the outcome here.\n\nHmm, so first, they had an agreement. The user says it's a \"foregone conclusion,\" meaning they both understood each would have two. The user ate both of theirs, and the husband ate one of his. The second one he left in the fridge, possibly because he wanted to save it for later. The user then ate the husband's remaining cupcake, thinking he didn't want it anymore. But the husband was actually planning to keep it for a special occasion. \n\nThe user argues that the cupcakes would go bad, so they had to eat it. But maybe the husband could have eaten it earlier or stored it properly. However, the user didn't check with him first. The husband's point is that it was his cupcake, and the user didn't respect his choice to save it. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The user might have thought they were being helpful by preventing waste, but the husband's intention was to keep it for a specific time. The user should have communicated or checked with the husband before taking the last one. Even if the cupcakes were perishing, the husband had the right to decide how to handle his own. So, the user's action might have disregarded the husband's preferences. \n\nI think the key is the unspoken agreement. If they usually split them, but the husband had a specific plan for his remaining cupcake, the user should have been aware or at least confirmed. The husband didn't mention it, but the user also didn't ask. The user's insensitivity here is acknowledged, which might indicate they didn't take the husband's feelings into account. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't check with their husband and went against his unspoken but actual plan. Even if the cupcakes were about to expire, the husband's intention to save it for later matters. The user didn't respect the husband's ownership of his own cupcake.\n"
