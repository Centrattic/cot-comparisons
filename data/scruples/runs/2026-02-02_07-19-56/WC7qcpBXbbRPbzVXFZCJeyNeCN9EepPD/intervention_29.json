Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake meant for her husband. \n\nFirst, the context: They bought a four-pack of cupcakes. They usually split them two each. The author ate both of her cupcakes on the first day, and the husband ate one. The second cupcake was left in the fridge. The author ate it because she thought he didn't want it, and the husband was upset because he was saving it for a celebration.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's actions: she assumed the cupcake was fair game after five days in the fridge, and she didn't check with her husband. The husband felt it was his and was upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the cupcakes were purchased as a shared item. They split them, so each had two. The husband didn't eat his second one, so maybe it's a shared resource that wasn't used. The author ate it, possibly to avoid waste. She might argue that it was a practical decision. \n\nOn the other hand, even if it's a shared purchase, the husband had his own portion. The author didn't check with him before eating it. The husband had a reason to save it, and the author took it without considering his intention. The husband's feelings are hurt because he had a specific plan for that cupcake. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The husband's side is that the author should have checked with him, or at least not eaten his intended cupcake. The author's justification is that it was about to go bad. But maybe the husband could have told her his plan earlier. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the author didn't communicate. Even if the cupcakes were shared, once they were split, each person's portion is their own unless otherwise agreed. The author took the husband's part without asking. So, maybe she's in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that cupcakes in the fridge for five days are about to expire, and it's better to eat them than let them go bad. However, the husband had a specific intention, so maybe the author should have considered that. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the cupcakes were a shared purchase, the husband's intention was to save his cupcake. The author didn't check, so she might be at fault here. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider the husband's intent and didn't check with him before eating his cupcake.\n"
