Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author bought four cupcakes and they usually split them two each. She ate her first two, and he had one. The remaining one was in the fridge. She thought he didn't want it anymore after five days and ate it. He was upset because he was saving it for a project celebration.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared items and unspoken agreements. They usually split the cupcakes two each, so there's an expectation. But when he didn't eat his second one, she took it. Cupcakes do have a shelf life, and five days might be pushing it. She probably thought it was about to go bad, so she ate it to avoid waste. But he had a specific plan for it, and she didn't check with him.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they didn't have a strict rule about saving leftovers. If he didn't mention it, maybe she had a right to assume it wasn't needed. But then again, since it was a shared item, maybe she should have communicated. The question is whether her actions were considerate enough. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top, but he was saving it for something. The author might be in the wrong because she didn't ask, even if she thought it was about to expire. On the flip side, if he didn't eat it within a reasonable time, maybe she was justified in taking it. \n\nI think the main issue here is communication. The author didn't check with him before eating his cupcake, even though they usually split them. So even if she thought it was about to go bad, not discussing it first might make her responsible. But the husband could have mentioned he was saving it. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the lack of communication.\n"
