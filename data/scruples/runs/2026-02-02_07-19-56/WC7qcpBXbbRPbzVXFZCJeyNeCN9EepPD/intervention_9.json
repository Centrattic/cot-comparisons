Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is about a couple who each bought two cupcakes. The husband and wife usually split them that way. The husband ate one on the first day, left the second in the fridge. The wife noticed and ate it, not knowing he was saving it for a personal celebration. Now there's a bet: if the wife wins, the husband shops with her; if the husband wins, she does something else (embarrassing for her, but not specified here). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The husband had his second cupcake in the fridge for five days. The wife decided to eat it because she thought it was going bad. The husband was upset because he was saving it for a work-related victory. The wife's argument is that the cupcakes have a shelf life, so one of them should eat it before it goes bad. The husband's argument is that it was his cupcake, and she should have checked first.\n\nNow, considering the context of their usual behavior. They split the four-pack into two each. The wife ate both of hers the first day, the husband ate one. The second cupcake he saved, but didn't communicate that. The wife, thinking he wasn't going to eat it, took it. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the wife was wrong for not checking first. The husband didn't specify he was saving it. But the wife's action led to his disappointment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the husband should have communicated that he was saving it. However, the wife did assume he wasn't going to eat it, which led her to take it. Even if the cupcakes have a shelf life, the usual arrangement was that each had their own. So, by eating his leftover cupcake, she crossed into his share without checking. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, even if the husband didn't communicate, the wife should have asked first. The husband's disappointment is valid because it was his cupcake. The wife's action was a bit inconsiderate because she didn't check, even if her reasoning was about not wasting food. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because she took her husband's cupcake without verifying his intentions, even if she thought it was going bad. The husband saved it for a reason, and she didn't respect his ownership of that cupcake. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
