Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for the husband. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author bought a four-pack of cupcakes, split them so each gets two. The husband had one left in the fridge. The author ate it, not knowing the husband wanted to save it for a celebration. Now, he's upset, and there's a bet on who is right.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they were about to go bad. So, they took the initiative to eat it. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked first.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. They usually split them, so maybe it's assumed that each keeps their own. But if the husband wanted to save his for later, maybe he should have communicated that. However, the author didn't check, even though it's their shared space. There's a middle ground here. \n\nCupcakes can go bad, so the author's action might be understandable. But since it was his cupcake, maybe the author should have asked. But given that they split them in the beginning, maybe it's a shared resource, and it's reasonable to use it before it spoils. \n\nThe husband's upset reaction might be because he had a special reason to save it, but he didn't mention it. The author might not be wrong since they didn't know. So, maybe it's a gray area. However, in terms of responsibility, if there's an unspoken agreement to leave each other's portions, the author might have broken that. But if it's more of a shared resource, then it's okay. \n\nI think the answer depends on the unspoken rules in their relationship. Since the author didn't check, maybe they should have. But the husband could have communicated his intent to save it. It's a bit of a toss-up. But in terms of the question, the author is asking if they are the asshole. In these kinds of situations, sometimes the person who acts unilaterally without checking might be seen as in the wrong, even if the other party could have communicated better. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't check with the husband even though they knew he had a cupcake left. Alternatively, B (No) if it's considered a shared resource. But given the way the husband felt it was his, the author should have asked. So leaning towards A.\n"
