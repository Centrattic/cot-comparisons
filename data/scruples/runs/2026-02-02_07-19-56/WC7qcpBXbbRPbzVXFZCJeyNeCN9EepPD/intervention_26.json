Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake meant for her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they bought four cupcakes, each usually gets two. The author ate both of hers on day one, her husband had one. The next day, she noticed his remaining cupcake in the fridge and ate it. He was saving it for a work project celebration and was upset when she ate it.\n\nThe author's reasoning: cupcakes have a short shelf life, five days in the fridge was pushing it, so someone should eat before they go bad. Also, he didn't tell her he was saving it.\n\nHis side: it was his cupcake, she shouldn't have eaten it without checking.\n\nNow, considering the context. They had a usual routine where they each get two. If the husband had one left, maybe he didn't mention it because he didn't want to use it yet. The author assumed he didn't want it, but he actually did. The question is whether she should have checked first or not. \n\nOn one hand, the cupcakes were shared? Or were they split into each person's two? If they were split, then the husband's remaining cupcake was his, so eating it without asking might be wrong. If they were shared as a group of four, maybe it's okay. But the original setup says \"we each get two,\" so they each had their own. \n\nThe husband saving it for a celebration implies he intended to keep it, even if he didn't mention it. The author didn't ask, so she took it. The husband was hurt, which is a factor. The author didn't consider his possible intention to save it. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because she took his cupcake without checking, even if it was an assumption. The husband's intent was not communicated, but respecting ownership is important. The author could have asked if he wanted to eat it before taking it. \n\nAlternatively, the cupcakes were perishable, so maybe the author had a valid reason to prevent them from going bad. But if the husband was saving it, that's his responsibility. However, the author didn't know. So perhaps she's not entirely at fault. But the husband's intent was there, even if unspoken. \n\nHmm. In relationships, communication is key. The husband didn't mention his intention, but the author didn't ask. Both might share some responsibility. However, since the husband had his own cupcake, the author taking it without asking could be seen as wrong. So leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
