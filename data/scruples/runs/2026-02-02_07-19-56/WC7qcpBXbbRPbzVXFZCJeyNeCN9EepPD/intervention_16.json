Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author bought four cupcakes, expecting each to have two. They each ate one the first day. The husband had one left in the fridge. The author ate the last one the next day, not knowing the husband was saving it for a celebration. Now, the husband is upset because he had a plan to save it.\n\nThe author's argument is that cupcakes have a short shelf life and five days is pushing it, so one of them should eat it before it goes bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked or not eaten it.\n\nHmm. When people share something, like splitting cupcakes, there's an unspoken agreement. If each gets two, but the husband saved his second one for later, maybe he didn't communicate that. But the author didn't check if he wanted it before eating it. Even if the cupcakes are going bad, if the husband wanted to save it, he might have expected the author to check or maybe not take it. \n\nThe question is about ownership. If it was his cupcake, then maybe the author shouldn't have eaten it without asking. The author might have assumed it was fair game, but since the husband had a specific plan, the author's action disrupted that. \n\nBut then, maybe the husband should have communicated that he was saving it. The author didn't know. However, the assumption was that each had two, so maybe the author thought it was okay to take it if the husband didn't eat it. But the problem is that the husband had an intention to save it, and the author didn't consider that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the husband was saving it, maybe he should have mentioned it. But the author's action of taking it without checking might be the issue. So, is the author in the wrong? If they should have checked first, then yes. If they thought it was fair to take the leftovers, maybe not. \n\nThe outcome hinges on whether the author is responsible for assuming the husband might want to save it. Since the husband's plan was to save it, and the author didn't check, the author might be in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
