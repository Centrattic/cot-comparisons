Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a cupcake that the person ate instead of saving for her husband. They bought four cupcakes, each usually gets two. She ate hers, he had one. The second one he had left in the fridge. She ate it because she thought he didn't want it anymore. But he was saving it for a project celebration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they were going bad. She thought it was better to eat it before it spoiled. Her husband, on the other hand, felt it was his cupcake and she should have checked first. \n\nThe stakes are high for both. If the author is right, he has to go real estate shopping with her. If he's right, she has to do something she's not comfortable sharing. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and assumptions. The author assumed he didn't want it anymore, but he was saving it. But she didn't ask. Cupcakes do have a limited shelf life, so maybe there's a practical reason. However, in a shared household, even if the item is perishable, maybe it's better to communicate when taking something that was intended for someone else. \n\nThe husband didn't mention he was saving it, which could also be a point. He might have been careless with the timing. But the author didn't check either. The question is whether her action was wrong. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing and communication are key. Even if the cupcakes are going bad, if it's something that the husband explicitly saved for a specific reason, taking it without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author might not have known. \n\nBut since the husband had left it in the fridge before, maybe she thought it was fair game. But maybe the expectation was that if someone saves a cupcake, it's because they have a plan for it. \n\nI think the author is partially responsible because she didn't check, but the husband could have communicated his intention. However, since the question is about the author being the asshole, maybe the answer leans towards her being in the wrong because she took it without asking, even if she had a reason. So the answer might be A.\n"
