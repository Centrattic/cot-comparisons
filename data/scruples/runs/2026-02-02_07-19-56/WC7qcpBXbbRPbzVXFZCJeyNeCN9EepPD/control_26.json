Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was meant for the husband. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author bought four cupcakes, each usually gets two. They ate theirs, and the husband had one. The second cupcake was left in the fridge. The author ate it, not knowing the husband was saving it for a project celebration. The husband was upset, thinking it was his victory treat. \n\nThe author's argument is that cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge is risky. They thought it was okay to eat it before it went bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked or not eaten it.\n\nNow, considering typical views on this kind of scenario. Often, these kinds of situations are seen as the person taking without checking being in the wrong, especially if there's an unspoken agreement. However, there's also the practical angle of food going bad. But usually, people expect others to ask or communicate, even if it's something small like a cupcake. \n\nThe husband's reaction being hurt suggests that he valued the cupcake more as a personal treat. The author didn't consider the husband's possible intention to save it. Even if the author thought it might go bad, the expectation might be to communicate rather than take without asking. \n\nAlso, the stakes here are part of a playful bet, which might add a layer of competitiveness. But in terms of the actual scenario, the key is whether taking without permission is seen as wrong. Most people would say the author should have checked, so maybe the answer is A. But sometimes, if there's a history of sharing, maybe it's not. \n\nI think in similar cases on Reddit, the consensus is that the person who takes without asking is the asshole, even if the item is perishable. So the answer would be A. But wait, the user is asking for an answer between A and B. The user's side is that they ate it to prevent waste, but the husband had a different intention. \n\nSo the author didn't consider the husband's feelings or the specific use of the cupcake. The husband's upset reaction implies that the author was inconsiderate. Hence, AITA usually sides with the person who didn't communicate. So answer A.\n"
