Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband. The author bought four cupcakes, each usually gets two. They ate both of theirs, the husband had one, and the second one was left in the fridge. The author ate it, assuming the husband didn't want it anymore. The husband was upset because he was saving it for a project victory.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. The key points are: shared cupcakes, usual practice of splitting them, the husband kept his second one in the fridge, the author ate it without checking, and the husband was upset. The author's defense is that the cupcakes had a shelf life and they wanted to avoid waste. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked.\n\nFirst, the usual practice is important. If they usually split them, maybe the assumption is that if one's not eaten in a day, it's up for grabs. But the husband might have different habits. The author didn't check, which is a point against them. However, the husband didn't consume it either, so maybe the author thought it was okay. The husband's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe he overreacted, but the author didn't consider his feelings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have asked if the husband still wanted the cupcake. The husband might have expected the author to wait or communicate. The author's reasoning about shelf life is valid, but maybe they could have handled it more considerately, like offering to eat it together or saving it but not taking it without asking. \n\nThe stakes here are a bit high with the \"ITA\" (I Take It All) format, where the outcome affects a weekend arrangement. That might add some tension. But the core issue is about respecting each other's property and communication. The author didn't communicate, so even if the cupcakes were meant to be shared, taking without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the husband also didn't eat it immediately, so maybe the author thought it was fair game. The husband's reaction seems a bit childlike, but that doesn't negate the author's responsibility to check. In relationships, communication is key. The author might not be the asshole, but they could have been more considerate. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's a middle ground. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they didn't check and the husband had a right to his cupcake, maybe the author is slightly in the wrong, but perhaps not entirely. \n\nBut according to the options, it's A or B. If the author didn't check and took it without considering the husband's possible needs, then A (Yes, in the wrong) might be the answer. However, if the usual practice allows for taking leftovers without checking, then B (No). The husband's saving it for a special occasion might not have been communicated, so the author had no way of knowing. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nHmm. The answer likely depends on the expectation of communication. Since the author didn't check, even if the husband didn't eat it, the act of taking without asking could be seen as a mistake. So, A (Yes) might be the correct answer. But some might argue B because the husband didn't consume it either, so the author had a reason to take it. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because the husband's intention wasn't communicated, and the author didn't check.\n"
