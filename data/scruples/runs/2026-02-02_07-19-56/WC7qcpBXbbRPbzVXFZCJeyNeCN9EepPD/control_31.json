Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a cupcake that the husband was saving, and the author ate it instead.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. They usually split the cupcakes, two each. The author ate both of hers the first day, the husband ate one. Then the next day, the author noticed his second cupcake was still in the fridge and ate it. The husband was upset because he was saving it for a work project celebration.\n\nSo the main points are: the author didn't check with her husband before eating the last cupcake, and he was upset because he had a reason to save it. The author argues that the cupcake was about to expire and should be eaten before it goes bad.\n\nNow, considering social norms and shared resources in a relationship. When people share items, especially food, it's common to communicate about it. The husband saved his cupcake, implying he intended to have it later. The author assumed it was okay to eat it because it was in the fridge and the shelf life was up. But she didn't check with him. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences and boundaries is important. Even if the cupcake was going bad, the husband had a specific reason to keep it. The author might have been inconsiderate by not asking first. However, maybe the husband should have communicated his intent better. But since the husband expressed being hurt, the author's action might have been thoughtless.\n\nThe stakes are high because the outcome affects their weekend plans. The author's side is that they should have eaten it before it spoiled, but the husband's side is about respecting his choice. \n\nI think the key here is the lack of communication. The author didn't confirm with her husband, even though they usually split the cupcakes. If they had a routine, maybe the author assumed it was still okay, but the husband's specific intention to save it for a celebration wasn't communicated. The author could have asked if he still wanted it. Since she didn't, she might be at fault for not checking. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
