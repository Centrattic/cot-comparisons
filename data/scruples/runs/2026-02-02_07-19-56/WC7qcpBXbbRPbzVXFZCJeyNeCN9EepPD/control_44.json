Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband. The author bought four cupcakes, each usually splits them into two each. They ate their first two, the husband had one, and the second one was left in the fridge. The author ate the remaining one, not knowing the husband had saved it for a project celebration. Now he's upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are expectations and communication. The author thought the leftover cupcake was fair game since the husband didn't eat it, maybe assuming it was being wasted. But the husband had a different plan for it. The author didn't check with him before eating it. \n\nThe author's defense is that cupcakes have a shelf life and it was about to go bad, so they should eat it. But maybe the husband had a reason to keep it longer. The problem is the lack of communication. The author took it without asking, even though there was a possibility the husband wanted to save it. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband could have mentioned his intention to save it earlier, so maybe part of the issue is that he didn't communicate his plans. But the question is about the author's actions. Since the cupcakes were shared, the author might have assumed it was okay to eat the remaining one. However, maybe they should have checked in, especially since there was a tradition of splitting them. \n\nIn situations like this, it's often about respecting each other's preferences. If the husband wanted to save it, he should have made that clear. But the author's action was based on their own assumption. So, maybe the author is a bit inconsiderate for not checking, even if the cupcake was about to go bad. The husband's reaction is a bit over the top, but the author's lack of communication might make them the asshole here. So, answer A.\n"
