Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is the asshole (AITA) for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. The answer options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The couple usually splits the cupcakes they buy. She ate both of hers on the first day, her husband had one. The second day, she noticed his remaining cupcake in the fridge and ate it. He was upset because he was saving it for a celebration.\n\nSo, the key points here are the established norm (splitting cupcakes), the timeline of events, and the reason behind her actions. She argues that the cupcake was about to expire and that one of them should eat it before it goes bad. He claims it was his and she should have checked with him.\n\nThe question is whether she breached an unspoken agreement. Normally, when couples split something, they expect each to take their share. But in this case, she went beyond her share and took his. However, he didn't eat it, so maybe he wasn't using his share. But the norm was to split them, so she might have assumed he didn't want it anymore after not eating it. However, he had a reason to save it, which she wasn't aware of. \n\nThe twist is that there's a bet involved: if she's the AITA, she has to do something with her husband, and vice versa. The humor here is that it's a playful scenario, but the ethics are about respecting each other's expectations. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, even if the cupcake was expiring, eating someone else's food without checking could be seen as inconsiderate. The husband had saved it for a specific reason, so not asking might be the issue. However, if there's an established norm that leftovers are fair game, that changes things. But in most cases, even with shared items, people might expect their own portion to be respected unless otherwise stated. \n\nThe user's defense is that it was about to go bad, but she could have communicated instead of assuming. The husband's upset reaction suggests he felt his personal space was invaded. \n\nIn AITA situations, the key is whether the action was inconsiderate or breached an agreement. Here, the author took her husband's cupcake without asking, even though they had a usual split. So, technically, she might be in the wrong because she didn't check, even if she thought it was about to expire. But maybe the husband should have communicated he was saving it. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the default assumption is that unspoken leftovers are fair game. However, since they had a norm to split them, not checking could be a breach. So, likely answer A (yes, she's wrong) because she didn't check, even if she had a reason. But the twist with the bet might be a red herring. \n\nAlternatively, if the cupcakes were shared and the husband didn't eat his, maybe she's not wrong for using the resource before it spoiled. It's a bit of a gray area. However, considering typical social norms, people expect their own portion to be respected unless they give permission. So, eating it without asking is probably the asshole move here. Therefore, answer A.\n"
