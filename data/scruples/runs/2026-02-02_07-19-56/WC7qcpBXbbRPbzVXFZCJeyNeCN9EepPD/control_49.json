Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake that her husband had saved. The situation involves some humor and a bet, but the core issue is about shared resources and communication.\n\nFirst, the cupcakes were bought in a four-pack. They usually split them, two each. The husband had one left, which he apparently saved for a celebration. The author ate the remaining one, not knowing it was saved. The husband was upset because he wanted to save it for his project completion.\n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. The author thought it was a shared purchase, so they each had two. She ate her two first, then when the husband had one left, she took his remaining one. The husband, on the other hand, had saved his last cupcake for a specific reason. \n\nThe author argues that cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was pushing it, so someone should have eaten it before it went bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, so the author shouldn't have eaten it without asking.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether she overstepped by eating his cupcake without checking. They had an established pattern of splitting them, but maybe he had a good reason to save his. The author didn't check if he wanted to keep it, which could be seen as not respecting his decision to save it. \n\nOn the other hand, the cupcakes were a shared purchase, so there's an expectation that they can be shared. But if he wanted to save his, he should have communicated that. The author might not be in the wrong because the original agreement was to split them, and maybe he should have mentioned if he wanted to keep one. However, not checking could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, communication is key. Since the husband didn't explicitly mention he wanted to save his, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the fact that he had a specific reason (celebration) could mean she should have asked. The answer might depend on cultural norms or their specific relationship dynamics. But generally, if they had a prior agreement, and he deviated from it without communication, the fault is shared. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven the options, I think the answer is B (Not the Asshole), because she had a prior pattern of splitting, and he didn't communicate his intent to save it. The responsibility for communication is mutual here. The author might be inconsiderate, but not necessarily in the wrong if they had an established norm. So, answer B.\n"
