Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a cupcake that was bought for two, but the wife ate the last one instead of saving it for her husband. They both bought two cupcakes each, but the husband had one left. The wife ate it without asking, and he was upset because he wanted to save it for a personal celebration.\n\nSo first, the key points here: The wife assumed the husband didn't want the cupcake since it was in the fridge, and she ate it. The husband had saved his for a project completion. The wife's defense is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they might go bad. The husband's point is that it was his and she should have checked.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know. The question is whether she's the asshole here. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to analyze the situation. The wife bought the cupcakes, they usually split them. She ate hers, he had one left. She didn't check with him before eating his. The husband was saving it for a specific reason. The wife's action was based on assumption that it was going to expire, but maybe she should have communicated. \n\nIs it a case of common courtesy? Even if the cupcake was going to expire, maybe she should have asked. The husband's side is that it was his, so she shouldn't take it without permission. The wife's side is that it's better to eat it before it goes bad. \n\nBut maybe the husband's intention to save it for a personal milestone matters. If he wanted to save it, but didn't communicate, does that make him partially at fault? Or does the wife have a responsibility to check? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The wife assumed, the husband had an unspoken plan. But the wife's assumption led to an action that upset him. So maybe she's in the wrong because she didn't check. The humor and the stakes (doing something embarrassing vs. going shopping) might influence the perception, but the actual issue is about respecting each other's property and communication. \n\nSo the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't communicate, even if her reasoning was about expiration. But maybe B (No) if the expiration is a valid reason. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nBut typically in these kinds of scenarios, people are expected to ask before taking something that belongs to someone else, especially if it's a shared item but each has their own portion. If the husband had his own cupcake, it's his to do with as he wishes, even if he's saving it. So the wife overstepped by taking it without asking. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
