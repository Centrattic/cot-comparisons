Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. The stakes are high because depending on who wins, they have to do something the other wants.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author bought four cupcakes, each usually eats two. She ate hers the first day, husband had one. The second cupcake was in the fridge, and she ate it without checking. The husband was saving it for a work celebration, and he was upset. \n\nSo, from her side, she thought it was about to expire, so she ate it to prevent waste. From his side, it was his cupcake, and she should have checked. \n\nThe key points are: Was there an agreement or unspoken rule? She assumed they split them, but maybe he had a specific plan. The cupcakes had a shelf life, so maybe she's justified in not wanting them to go bad. However, not checking with him first could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nMarriage often involves communication. Even if there's a usual practice, maybe in this case, he had a different intention. The husband might have had a right to his cupcake for a special occasion. The author didn't consider that he might have a different use for it. \n\nBut then again, if the usual practice is to split them, maybe he should have communicated his plan. However, the author didn't confirm before eating it. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a judgment call. Some might say she should have checked, others might say the husband should have communicated. But since the husband was saving it for something specific, and the author didn't consider that, she might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the usual practice was to split, then maybe not. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue about unspoken expectations. The author might be in the wrong for not checking, even if she thought it was okay. The husband's disappointment suggests that he had a legitimate expectation to use it for his celebration. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Maybe it's B (Not in the wrong) because the cupcakes were about to expire and she had a good reason. Hmm. \n\nI think the key is that even though the usual practice was to split, in this case, the husband had a specific plan. The author should have checked. So, answer A.\n"
