Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. The story says they usually split the cupcakes, two each. She ate both of hers and one of his. He had one left, which he was saving for a project celebration. She ate the last one because she thought he didn't want it anymore, considering it was in the fridge for five days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that cupcakes have a shelf life and they were about to go bad. She might have thought it was better to eat it than waste it. Also, the couple has a tradition where they split the cupcakes. However, her husband had a specific reason to save his, and he was upset because he wanted to celebrate his project completion with it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect for each other's intentions. The author didn't check with her husband before eating the last cupcake, even though she knew he had one left. While she might have thought he wasn't going to eat it, assuming someone's intentions without asking can be an issue. The husband felt his cupcake was his, and the author took it without confirming, which could be seen as disregarding his plan. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing and splitting things is common, but personal items, even if part of a shared purchase, can be expected to be respected. The husband's intention to save it for a celebration adds a layer of personal significance. The author's action, while possibly based on practicality (preventing waste), didn't account for her husband's emotional attachment to the cupcake. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't communicate her intention to eat the last cupcake, even though the cupcakes were shared. The husband's side is about ownership and not being consulted, which is a valid point. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she should have checked with her husband before consuming his cupcake, especially knowing he had a specific plan for it.\n"
