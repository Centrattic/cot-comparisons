Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for her husband. The stakes are pretty high\u2014either she has to go real estate shopping with him or she has to do something else she's not comfortable with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author bought four cupcakes, and usually they split them two each. She ate both of hers on the first day, he had one. The second cupcake he had was left in the fridge. She decided to eat it because she thought he wasn't going to. He was saving it for a project celebration and was upset.\n\nThe author's defense is that cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was pushing it. She thought she should eat it before it went bad. His side is that it was his cupcake, and she should have either not eaten it or asked first.\n\nHmm. In terms of the rules of the situation, the user mentions that they usually split them, so maybe there's an unspoken agreement here. If she ate his cupcake without checking, even if it was in the fridge, maybe she's assuming it was okay? But he had a specific reason for saving it. \n\nOn one hand, she's taking responsibility for her own actions, but she might have overstepped by eating his. On the other hand, he could have communicated better by either eating it before or telling her that he was saving it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. If she usually splits them, maybe she should have checked before eating the last one. But he didn't specify that this particular cupcake was for a celebration. The fridge storage time is a practical point, but if he saved it, maybe he knew it could last longer. \n\nSo, the question is whether her actions were inconsiderate. If there's an established norm to split, but she went ahead and took his without asking, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if she thought it was about to go bad, maybe she had a practical reason. But the husband's emotional response suggests that he valued it more for his celebration. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and communication. The author didn't ask, and even if there's a norm, saving it for a specific reason might require a conversation. So, she might be in the wrong for not checking, even if she had her reasons. Alternatively, the husband could have communicated his intention earlier. \n\nBut since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the outcome of the vote has consequences, the community might lean towards her being the asshole because she took his food without asking, even if it was past the usual time. The husband's side is about ownership and respect for his choice. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't check with him first, even though there was a norm. The husband had a specific plan for his cupcake, and she assumed he wasn't going to eat it. Not respecting his choice, even if she had her reasoning, makes her the asshole here.\n"
