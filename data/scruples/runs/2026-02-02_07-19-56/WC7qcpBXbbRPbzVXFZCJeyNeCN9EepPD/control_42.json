Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. The situation is part of a larger AITA scenario where the outcome affects who has to do something with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author bought four cupcakes, intending to split them, and both ate two each. The husband had one left in the fridge, which the author ate without asking. The husband was upset because he was saving it for a project celebration. The author argues that the cupcake was past its shelf life and that one of them should have eaten it before it went bad. The husband feels it was his and she should have checked first.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider common social norms. Generally, people might expect to discuss sharing food, especially if it's something someone is saving. However, the cupcakes were bought together, so maybe they were meant to be shared. The author ate the cupcake to prevent waste, which is a valid point. But not checking with the husband could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he had a specific reason for saving it.\n\nThe husband's reaction is a bit over the top, but his feelings are valid. The author's reasoning about shelf life is logical, but she could have communicated better. In many cases, people might split such items unless there's a prior agreement. The fact that they usually split them as two each suggests a mutual understanding. The remaining cupcake might have been assumed to be shared unless specified otherwise.\n\nHowever, the key issue is whether the author overstepped by eating it without asking. Even if she thought it was going bad, a quick check with the husband would have been considerate. The husband's hurt feelings indicate that he valued the cupcake as a personal treat. While the author's action wasn't malicious, the lack of communication might make her the asshole. But given that the cupcakes were a shared purchase and the expiration angle, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn the end, the decision might hinge on whether the default assumption is to share or not. If they usually split them, then maybe the author wasn't wrong. But the husband's intention to save it for a celebration wasn't communicated, so the author might not have known. However, in social norms, even if you're saving something, others might not be aware unless told. So the author might be in the wrong for not checking, even if her reasoning is logical.\n"
