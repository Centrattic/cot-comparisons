Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband.\n\nFirst, the key points. The wife bought four cupcakes, each usually taking two. She ate both hers the first day, he had one. The remaining one was in the fridge. She ate it without checking, not knowing he saved it for a celebration. Now he's upset. The stakes are high for both: she gets to make him go shopping, or she has to do something embarrassing.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether she was wrong to eat the last cupcake without checking. The husband's side is that it was his, so she shouldn't have eaten it. Her side is that cupcakes have a shelf life and she didn't want it to go bad.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, when couples have shared items, expecting communication is important. Even if it's agreed to split them, if one person has an item left and plans to use it later, the other shouldn't assume it's okay to take it. The wife didn't check, which led to conflict. She might have thought it was fine because it was in the fridge, but the husband had a specific reason to save it.\n\nThe question is about social norms. Usually, it's considered polite to check with your partner before using something that's theirs, especially if it's a personal item. So even if the cupcakes were shared, once he had one left, it's his to use. The wife's action of eating it without communication might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the expiration angle is a counterpoint. But maybe the husband could have communicated that he was saving it. \n\nIn many cases, the standard advice is that if you're going to do something that affects your partner's plans, you should talk about it. Since the wife didn't check, she might be in the wrong. The husband's reaction, while a bit childish, is understandable given he had a planned celebration. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't communicate and assumed she could eat it without considering his possible plans.\n"
