Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating the last cupcake instead of saving it for her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author bought four cupcakes, each was supposed to get two. The husband had one left in the fridge, and the author ate it without checking. The husband was upset because he was saving it for a work celebration. \n\nSo, the key points here are about shared expectations vs. individual ownership. The author thought it was a shared purchase, so they each take two. The husband, however, might have considered that last cupcake as his personal item to save. \n\nThe author's defense is that cupcakes have a shelf life and she didn't want it to go bad. The husband's side is about ownership and not being asked. \n\nNow, considering social norms, when people share something, like splitting a purchase, unless there's a specific agreement otherwise, it's implied that each person's share is theirs. But if one person decides to save theirs for later, others might not realize that. However, in this case, the husband saved one for a specific reason, which the author didn't consider. \n\nThe author didn't check if he was done with his share. Even though the initial agreement was to split, once the husband had one left, maybe it's reasonable to assume he might not need it. But since he was saving it, the author should have asked. The argument is about communication. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because she assumed ownership over the remaining cupcake without verifying if the husband needed it. The husband's intention to save it for a celebration was his own plan, which the author didn't take into account. \n\nBut there's also the shelf life factor. Maybe the cupcakes were going bad. But the husband had it in the fridge for five days. That's probably past the optimal time, but maybe not spoiled. The husband might have thought he could eat it later, but the author decided it was better to eat it now. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the initial agreement was to split. If the husband wanted to save his last one for later, he should have communicated that. But the author also should have checked, maybe. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't consider the husband's possible intention to save it and ate it without confirming. Even if the cupcakes were going bad, the husband might have preferred to eat them when he wanted. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
