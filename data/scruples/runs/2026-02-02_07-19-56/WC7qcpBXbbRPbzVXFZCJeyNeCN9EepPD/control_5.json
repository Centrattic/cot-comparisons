Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ate the last cupcake is in the wrong. The situation is that they bought four cupcakes, each usually eats two. The husband had one left in the fridge, and the author ate it. The husband was saving it for a celebration, but he didn't mention it. The key points are whether they should have communicated and if it's a shared or personal item.\n\nFirst, the cupcakes were bought together, so maybe they are shared. But each person gets two. The husband had one left, so he might have intended to keep it. The author ate it without checking, assuming he didn't want it. But the husband was saving it, which he didn't communicate. The author's side is that the cupcake was about to spoil, and someone should eat it. The husband's side is that it was his to save.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. If the husband didn't mention he was saving it, but the author assumed, maybe the author shares some blame. But the husband could have stated his intention earlier. The author might not be in the wrong because it's a shared item and the husband didn't clarify. However, not checking first could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer probably hinges on shared responsibilities vs individual ownership. In many relationships, shared items require communication. Since the author didn't check, even if the husband didn't mention it, maybe they should have. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But it's a toss-up. Maybe answer A or B. The key is whether not checking was wrong. If the cupcakes are shared, but each person's two are their own, then eating the husband's without asking is wrong. But if they're shared, then using them before they spoil is okay. The answer might be A or B. Hmm. The husband saved it for later, but didn't communicate. The author ate it assuming he didn't want it. The author might not be in the wrong because they had a prior agreement to split them, but the husband didn't clarify his intention to save it. So maybe the answer is B, not the author's fault. But maybe the author should have checked. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's side is that it was about to expire, so they had a reason. But the husband's side is that they should have checked. It's a common dilemma. The author probably isn't the asshole here because they had good intentions, but maybe they're a bit inconsiderate. However, the husband didn't communicate his plans. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
