Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the last cupcake. The author ate the last cupcake that was meant to be saved for her husband. They had a bet where if she wins, her husband has to go real estate shopping with her, and if he wins, she has to do something she's uncomfortable with.\n\nFirst, she bought four cupcakes, usually they each get two. She ate both of hers the first day, and he had one. The next day, she noticed his second one was still in the fridge. She assumed he didn't want it anymore, so she ate it. He was upset because he was saving it for a project celebration.\n\nSo the key points here are: they have an unspoken agreement to split the cupcakes. She ate his cupcake after he didn't use it, but he had a reason to save it. She thought it was going to expire, so she ate it. He felt it was his and she should have checked first.\n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole. Let's see. In situations like this, it's often about communication. If they usually split them, but there's no explicit agreement about leftovers, then maybe she should have asked. However, the cupcakes were in the fridge for five days, which is past their shelf life. Maybe she had a valid reason to eat it before it went bad. But he wanted to save it for a special occasion. \n\nOn one hand, she might have thought it was a waste to let it rot. On the other hand, he had a right to his cupcake. The fact that there's a bet involved might add a layer of tension, but the core issue is about respecting each other's choices. She didn't check with him, even though they usually split them. If she knew he was saving it, she might not have eaten it. But since she assumed he didn't want it, maybe she's not entirely at fault. However, not asking could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the bet is a big factor. The author is trying to win the bet, so maybe she's using the cupcake as a way to gain an advantage. However, the original agreement wasn't about the bet; the bet is a separate consequence. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the person is often at fault if they don't consider the other's perspective. Here, she didn't consider that he might have a reason to save it. Even if the cupcake was nearing expiry, she should have communicated. So maybe she's in the wrong. But then again, the cupcakes were in the fridge, and if there's an unspoken rule that they split them, but he didn't eat his, maybe it's fair game. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since the husband's cupcake was supposed to be his, and she ate it without asking, even if she thought it was a waste, she might be in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
