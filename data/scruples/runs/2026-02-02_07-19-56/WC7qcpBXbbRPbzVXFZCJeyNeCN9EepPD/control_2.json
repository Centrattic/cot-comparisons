Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposed to be saved for the husband. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author bought a four-pack of cupcakes. They usually split them, two each. The author ate both of their cupcakes on the first day, while the husband ate one. The second day, the author noticed the husband's remaining cupcake in the fridge and ate it. The husband was upset because he was saving it for a personal celebration after finishing a project. The author argues that the cupcakes had a shelf life and eating them before they went bad was reasonable. The husband feels it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked first.\n\nSo, the key points are about ownership and communication. The author didn't ask before eating the cupcake, even though they knew the husband had one left. They assumed he didn't want it based on the fridge and ate it. But the husband was using it for a specific reason. The author's defense is that they split the cupcakes, so maybe there's an unspoken agreement. But if the husband was saving his second one for later, maybe the author should have respected that. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The husband's upset reaction is significant here. Even if cupcakes have a shelf life, he was saving it for a special occasion. The author didn't consider that possibility and took it without asking. While it's true that the author might have eaten something before it spoiled, the husband had a specific plan. The author's insensitivity in not checking could be seen as the issue here. \n\nBut then again, maybe the husband should have communicated better. If he was saving the cupcake, maybe he should have mentioned it earlier. However, the husband's perspective is that it was his cupcake, so the author shouldn't have taken it without permission. The author had their own cupcakes and the husband had one left. The author ate both of theirs and then his. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might have overstepped by taking the cupcake without asking. Even if the husband didn't mention it, there's a shared space, and maybe the author should have checked. The husband's reaction shows that it was important to him, so the author's action caused unnecessary hurt. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
