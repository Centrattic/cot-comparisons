Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about eating the last cupcake that was meant to be saved for the husband. \n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author bought a four-pack of cupcakes, each of them usually had two. The husband had one left in the fridge, and the author ate it. The husband was saving it as a celebration for work, but he didn't mention it. The author thought it was better to eat it before it spoiled.\n\nSo, the key points here are: past practices (they usually split them two each), the timeline (cupcakes in the fridge for five days), communication (husband didn't tell the author about saving it), and the consequences (they're playing a game where the outcome depends on who wins).\n\nThe husband's argument is about ownership and communication. He saved it for a specific reason and expected the author to ask. The author's defense is that they were about to expire and that they had a usual routine. \n\nI need to consider if the author had a right to eat it given the circumstances. Since they had a shared routine, maybe the author assumed it was okay. But the husband had a different intention, even though he didn't communicate it. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. In many cases, using something you've bought together might not be a problem unless there's an explicit agreement. However, since the husband was saving it for a specific purpose, maybe the author should have checked. But if they usually split them and he didn't mention saving it, maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nThe outcome depends on whether the author was supposed to check or if the husband was supposed to communicate better. Since the husband didn't tell, but the cupcakes were past their shelf life, the author might have acted reasonably. But the husband's upset reaction adds another layer. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that if you're sharing something, you should discuss usage. However, if the husband didn't mention his plan, maybe the author isn't the asshole. However, the act of taking something that was intended to be saved without checking could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, there's a balance here. The answer might be A or B. But given that the husband didn't communicate his intent, and the author acted on the assumption of their usual routine, the answer might lean towards B (not the asshole), but some might say A because she didn't check. I think it's B.\n"
