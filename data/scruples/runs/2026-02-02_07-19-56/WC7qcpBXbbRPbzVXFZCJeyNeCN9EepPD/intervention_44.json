Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about eating the last cupcake that was supposedly saved for the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author bought four cupcakes, each expected to have two. They ate both of theirs, the husband had one, and then the second cupcake was left in the fridge. The author ate it, thinking the husband didn't want it anymore. The husband was saving it for a project celebration. Now, there's a bet: if the author is right, the husband has to go real estate shopping; if wrong, the author has to do something embarrassing.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's defense is that the cupcake was about to expire, so they should eat it before it goes bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked first. \n\nI have to consider ownership. When they bought the cupcakes, was there an unspoken agreement each gets two? The author ate both of theirs on day one, husband had one. The second cupcake was left. The husband might have intended to save his second one for later, maybe as a treat. The author assumed it was no longer wanted. But maybe they should have confirmed, even if it was a shared purchase. \n\nAlso, the stakes are high here. The author might be using the bet to avoid an activity they don't want to do. That could affect their judgment. If they knew that eating it would make them lose the bet, maybe they were a bit selfish. \n\nThe husband's reaction was hurt and upset. The author's response was insensitive. The husband had a valid reason for saving it. The author didn't communicate, even though the item was shared. Maybe they should have checked if the husband wanted it. \n\nBut cupcakes do expire. The author might think they were being responsible by not letting it go bad. However, ownership matters. If the husband had already claimed it as his, the author shouldn't eat it without permission. \n\nSo, in shared situations, even if it's a shared purchase, if one person saves their share, others should respect that unless there's a prior agreement. Since there's no mention of prior agreement to share leftovers, the author might have overstepped by taking the husband's cupcake without asking. Even if the husband didn't eat it yet, he had the right to save it. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not checking first and taking something that was someone else's.\n"
