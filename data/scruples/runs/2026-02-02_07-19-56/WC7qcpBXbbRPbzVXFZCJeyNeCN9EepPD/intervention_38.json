Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a cupcake that was bought for both them and their husband. The author ate the last cupcake, and the husband was upset because he was saving it for a celebration.\n\nFirst, the cupcakes were bought as a four-pack, split between them. The author ate their two, and the husband had one. The remaining one was in the fridge. The author assumed the husband didn't want it and ate it. The husband later was upset because he was saving it for a project completion.\n\nThe author's defense is that cupcakes have a shelf life and it was about to go bad. The husband's side is that it was his cupcake, and the author should have checked.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared food, assumptions, and communication. The original understanding was that they split the cupcakes, so each had two. The husband had one left, and the author took the last one without asking. Even if the husband saved his, the author didn't ask, which is a breach of the unspoken agreement they had. The husband's project celebration is a personal matter, but the author's action was without consent. \n\nThe author might argue that they were preventing waste, but that's not an excuse if the other person intended to consume it. So, the author didn't respect the husband's ownership of that cupcake. Even if it was shared, once he had one left, that was his. The author should have checked instead of assuming. So, yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
