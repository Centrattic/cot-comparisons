This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong regarding their autistic cousin and the dog. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nFirst, the author moved out, taking their dog with them. The family was told they could visit the dog anytime. The cousin is autistic. The first incident: the cousin was playing with the dog with a laser pen, which the dog usually chases. But the dog started barking and then ended up whining in the corner. The cousin was just smiling, didn't explain what happened. Then the author tried to intervene, got the cousin to leave.\n\nSecond incident: the cousin insisted on walking the dog, leading to a tantrum. The author tried to redirect with a PS4 offer, which worked briefly. Then the cousin ran around with the dog in his arms, which is dangerous for an old dog (13 years old). The author raised their voice, told the cousin no more visits if the behavior continued. The cousin dropped the dog, leading to a harsh landing, and then ran off. After the cousin's mom picked him up, the aunt called the author rude and selfish, citing the cousin's autism.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nNow, to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Let's break it down.\n\nFactors to consider: the cousin's autism, the author's responsibility for the dog's safety, appropriate handling of the situation.\n\nFirst, the cousin's autism might affect how he interacts with the dog. Autistic individuals might have different sensory processing, and the laser pen could be overstimulating the dog. The dog's barking indicates distress. The cousin's lack of response when asked what happened suggests possible communication difficulties.\n\nIn the second incident, the cousin's behavior of carrying the dog, who is old and doesn't like being picked up, is dangerous. The author's reaction was to raise their voice and threaten to stop visits. The cousin had a meltdown, leading to the dog being dropped. The author had to physically stop the cousin from going to their room.\n\nThe author's actions: they tried to set boundaries for the dog's safety. However, the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice, physical intervention\u2014might not be the best approach with an autistic individual. Autistic people sometimes react poorly to loud noises or sudden actions. The cousin might not understand the reasoning or how his actions are wrong. The author could have tried a different method to de-escalate the situation, considering the cousin's needs.\n\nThe aunt's response is also a factor. She called the author rude and selfish, which could be due to the author's handling of the situation. The author's decision to stop the visits entirely might be too harsh, especially if the cousin's behavior is due to his autism and not malice. The author might not have considered accommodations or alternative ways to ensure the dog's safety while allowing the cousin to interact calmly.\n\nHowever, the author has a right to protect their dog's well-being. If the cousin's behavior is harmful, the author is justified in setting boundaries. The problem is how the author enforced those boundaries. Maybe a more structured approach, like working with the family to teach the cousin appropriate behavior, would have been better. But the author might feel that after multiple incidents, the only option is to stop the visits entirely.\n\nBalancing the need for the dog's safety and the cousin's autism. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to stop the visits if the cousin's actions are genuinely harmful, but the approach taken could have been more considerate. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate and respectful of the cousin's needs. If the author didn't consider communication strategies or accommodations, that's a problem. But given the incidents, the author might be justified in protecting the dog.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The cousin's autism is a significant factor. The author might not have handled the situation perfectly but could be in the right if the dog's safety is at risk. On the other hand, the author might have been too harsh without considering the cousin's condition. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting their dog, but some might argue A if the approach was not accommodating enough. However, the key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. If the cousin's behavior is repeatedly harmful and the author has tried to address it without success, stopping the visits is a reasonable decision. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
