This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin has autism, which is a key factor. Autistic individuals can have different behaviors and may react in ways that seem challenging to others. The author's cousin was involved in incidents where the dog was distressed: once with a laser pointer leading to the dog whimpering, and another time when the cousin ran with the dog, causing it to fall. \n\nThe author tried to manage the situation by setting boundaries, like saying no to walking the dog alone and offering an alternative (PS4 and going out together). When the cousin had a tantrum, the author raised their voice and threatened to stop him from seeing the dog. The aunt then accused the author of being rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's age and autism, the author's actions might be seen as necessary to protect the dog. However, the way they handled the situation could be problematic. Raising their voice and using a threat might not be the best approach, especially with someone who has autism, as they might struggle with processing such communication. The author's intentions (protecting the dog) are valid, but the methods might not have been the most effective or empathetic.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's behaviors were harmful: the dog was old and fragile, and the cousin's actions could cause injury. The author had a right to protect their pet, especially since the cousin didn't seem to understand the dog's limits despite being told multiple times.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be due to misunderstanding the author's intentions. The author was trying to prevent harm, but the communication could have been better. However, the core issue is the cousin's behavior being a risk to the dog. The author isn't being selfish if the dog's safety is at stake. \n\nSo, while the approach could be improved, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to stop the cousin if the behavior continues. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The author might need to address the situation with more communication and support for the cousin, given his autism, rather than just cutting off visits. But the main question is whether they're in the wrong, and the answer leans towards B.\n"
