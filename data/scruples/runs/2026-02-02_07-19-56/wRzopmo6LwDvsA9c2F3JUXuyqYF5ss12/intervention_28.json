This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author moved out, taking the family dog. The cousin has autism. The cousin was allowed to visit the dog. The first incident: the dog was whimpering after being with the cousin, who was playing with a laser. The dog barked, then acted scared. The author is worried about the dog's safety. Then the cousin was insistent on walking the dog, leading to a tantrum and the cousin carrying the old dog, which the dog doesn't like. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop visits if the behavior continues. The cousin had a tantrum and when the aunt called, the author stood their ground.\n\nThe author's side: protecting the dog's well-being. The dog is old and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's behavior is causing stress to the dog. The author tried to set boundaries, which the cousin didn't respect. The aunt is defensive, maybe not considering the dog's welfare.\n\nThe cousin's side: he's autistic, which might affect his understanding of boundaries and the dog's needs. However, the author tried multiple times to intervene gently. The cousin's actions (tantrum, carrying the dog) could be harmful regardless of his autism.\n\nThe main points: The author's intention is to protect the dog from harm. The cousin's actions are risky. The author tried to communicate boundaries, but the cousin didn't comply. The aunt dismissed the author's concerns based on the cousin's autism without considering the dog's safety.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author's actions seem justified in protecting the dog. They tried to reason and set limits, which is necessary for the dog's well-being. The cousin's autism is a factor in his behavior, but the author isn't being cruel; they're establishing necessary boundaries. The aunt's reaction is inappropriate, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
