This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the cousin who posted on AITA (Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. \n\nFirst, the situation: The cousin moved out with their dog because their mom couldn't take care of it anymore. They allowed the family to visit the dog. The cousin's autistic cousin came over, played with the dog using a laser pen, which the dog usually chases. Then the dog started barking, and the cousin was unresponsive when asked what happened. Later, the cousin tried to walk the dog but ended up carrying the old dog, causing it to hit the floor. The cousin then had a tantrum. The cousin (ITA) threatened to stop the autistic cousin from seeing the dog, leading to conflict with the aunt.\n\nThe question is whether ITA is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFactors to consider: The dog is old (13 years), which makes it more delicate. The cousin's actions led to the dog being in a stressful situation and then injured when carried. The autistic cousin may not fully understand boundaries or the impact of their actions. The family's reaction was that the aunt called ITA rude and selfish, possibly because they didn't consider the cousin's autism in their response.\n\nITA's actions: They set boundaries to protect the dog, which is reasonable. However, their method of enforcing it by threatening to stop visits and handling the tantrum by grabbing the cousin's arm might be seen as harsh. The cousin's behavior might be due to their autism, which could require a more accommodating approach. However, the dog's safety is also a valid concern.\n\nPotential arguments for A (ITA is wrong): They didn't consider the autistic cousin's needs, handled the situation with raised voice and physical restraint, which might exacerbate the issue. The threat to stop visits could be seen as abrupt without trying alternatives.\n\nPotential arguments for B (ITA not wrong): They were protecting the dog's well-being, especially since the dog is old and fragile. The cousin's behavior was dangerous and disruptive. Setting boundaries is necessary for the dog's safety.\n\nI need to weigh the dog's safety against the cousin's needs. Since the dog is elderly, the risk of injury is higher. The cousin's actions did harm the dog. However, the way ITA handled the situation could be improved. But the core issue is whether the threat to stop visits is justified. Given that the cousin's actions put the dog in harm's way, ITA's concern is valid. However, maybe there's a middle ground. But the question is if ITA is in the wrong. Considering that the cousin's autism might require more understanding, but the dog's safety is also important. The answer might lean towards B, but I need to be careful. The aunt's reaction was unhelpful, but that doesn't mean ITA is wrong. ITA's actions were to protect the dog from harm, which is reasonable. So maybe B (ITA not wrong).\n"
