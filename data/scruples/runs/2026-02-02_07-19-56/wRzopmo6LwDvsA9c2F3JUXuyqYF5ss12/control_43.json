This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves their autistic cousin and the family dog.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author moved out and has a dog. They told their mom (and presumably others) that the cousin could visit. The cousin is autistic, which the aunt mentions as part of the reason for his behavior. \n\nThe key incidents are: the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, the dog ended up whimpering while the cousin was smiling, then later the cousin tried to carry the dog who doesn't like it and had a tantrum when told no. The author raised their voice and said they might stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt is upset, calling the author rude and selfish.\n\nSo, the author's side: They're responsible for the dog's well-being. The dog is old (13 years), doesn't like being picked up, and the cousin's actions might be harmful. The author is trying to protect the dog and manage the cousin's behavior, which is causing stress to the dog. The cousin's behavior seems to be escalating, leading to a situation where the dog was dropped. The author might feel they need to set boundaries to prevent harm.\n\nThe cousin's side: He's autistic, which can affect how he processes information and behaves. The aunt's argument is that he doesn't understand the rules because of his autism. The cousin might not realize that the dog doesn't like being picked up or that his behavior is inappropriate. The tantrum could be a result of not understanding the situation or being overwhelmed.\n\nNow, considering autism: People with autism might have different sensory needs, communication challenges, and may not interpret social cues the same way. If the cousin wasn't told clearly or in a way he could understand before, his actions might be a result of that. However, the author had explained the dog's preferences before, and the cousin still disregarded them, leading to the incident.\n\nThe author's response was to raise their voice and set a boundary by possibly cutting off visitation. The aunt is upset, but the author is also protecting the dog's safety. The question is whether the author overstepped or if they were justified in their actions.\n\nFactors to consider: Did the author give sufficient warnings or accommodations for the cousin's autism? Did they try to address the behavior in a way that's suitable for him? If the cousin didn't understand previous explanations, maybe a different approach was needed, like visual aids or a more structured way to communicate the rules. However, after multiple incidents (chasing the dog, picking it up against its will, tantrums), the author might feel it's necessary to protect the dog, especially since the dog is older and more fragile.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they didn't account for the cousin's autism in their approach, maybe. But if they tried to manage the situation and the behavior continued to be harmful, then they might be justified. The line between being firm and being harsh can be thin. The author's intention was to prevent harm, but their method (raising their voice, threatening to stop visits) might have been too abrupt without considering the cousin's needs. The aunt's reaction is also significant\u2014calling the author rude and selfish might be an overreaction, but the author's actions need to consider the cousin's condition.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is trying to protect the dog, which is their responsibility. However, considering the cousin's autism, there might have been a more effective way to handle the situation that still respects the cousin's needs. The author's final decision to stop the cousin from visiting might be necessary for the dog's safety but could be seen as harsh without proper support or understanding for the cousin. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's room for argument both ways. However, given the details, the author's actions were protective, and the problem is more about communication and accommodations for the cousin's autism rather than the author being entirely at fault.\n"
