This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin, a dog, and some incidents where the cousin was acting out. The author wants to stop the cousin from seeing their dog.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author moved out, took the dog, and allowed family visits. The cousin was with the dog, and there were two incidents: one where the dog was in the living room and then whimpering, and another where the cousin carried the dog while he was sleeping and then had a tantrum. After the author threatened to stop visits, the cousin's mom called them rude and selfish. Now, Aunt is upset, saying the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's behavior and the author's response. The cousin is autistic, which might affect how he processes situations. The first incident: the dog was in the living room with the cousin, barking. When the author arrived, the dog was whimpering, cousin was smiling. The author is worried about the dog's behavior. The second incident is more direct: the cousin carried the dog when he was sleeping and then had a tantrum when told to stop. The author raised their voice and said no more visits if the behavior continued. The cousin dropped the dog, who hit the ground hard, and ran off. The aunt later called the author out of order.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. They did warn the cousin multiple times. The cousin had a history of aggressive behavior (running around with the dog, who doesn't like being picked up) and then had a tantrum. The author's response was to set a boundary. But the problem is that the cousin is autistic. Autistic individuals might not understand the consequences of their actions, have sensory issues, or react differently to stress. The author's approach was to use a threat of cutting off visits after a specific incident where the dog was harmed (dropped hard). However, the author did try to redirect the cousin with the PS4 offer, which is a common behavior management technique. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't address the underlying issues. The cousin's behavior might be due to sensory overload or not understanding that the dog doesn't like being carried. The author might not have considered accommodations for the cousin's needs. For example, maybe the cousin wasn't taught how to interact with the dog properly, or the environment wasn't adjusted to his sensory needs. The author's response of raising their voice and threatening to stop visits might not be the most effective approach for an autistic individual, who may need more structured, calm guidance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is protecting the dog's well-being. The dog is old and was hurt when dropped. The author's responsibility is to ensure the dog isn't harmed. The cousin's behavior was escalating, and the author had to set a limit. However, the way the author handled it might not be the best approach for someone with autism. Maybe there's a middle ground where the cousin can still interact with the dog under supervision or with specific training.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author acted in the dog's best interest, but perhaps didn't consider the cousin's special needs adequately. The threat to stop visits might be necessary, but the method and communication could have been more sensitive. The aunt's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe the author should have communicated better with the family about the concerns before taking action. The cousin might not understand the rules or the reasons behind them, so the author's approach might have been too abrupt without proper explanation or accommodations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for protecting the dog, but they might have missed the opportunity to address the cousin's needs more effectively. However, since the cousin's behavior did result in harm, setting a boundary is understandable. The balance here is tricky. The answer might depend on whether the author considered the cousin's disability and adjusted their approach accordingly. If the author didn't account for the cousin's autism and just applied typical behavioral consequences, that could be the issue. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't adapt their approach to the cousin's needs, but some might say B (not in the wrong) because the dog's safety is paramount.\n"
