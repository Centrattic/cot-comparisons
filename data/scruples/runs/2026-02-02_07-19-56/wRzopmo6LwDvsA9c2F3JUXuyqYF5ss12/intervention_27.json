This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author moved into a new apartment with their friend and the family dog. They allowed the cousin to visit the dog, which their mom was happy about. Then there were two incidents: once when the dog was left alone with the cousin and came back whimpering, and another where the cousin carried the dog, leading to the dog being dropped. The author then decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nNow, the cousin is autistic. The author's actions might need to consider his needs and how he processes things. The first incident had the dog barking and acting scared, but the cousin didn't respond when asked. The second incident involved the cousin carrying the dog, which the dog doesn't like, leading to the dog being dropped. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop visits.\n\nThe aunt's reaction was that the author was out of order, citing the cousin's autism. The author argues the behavior was unacceptable. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to protect their dog's well-being. If the cousin's actions are harmful, they have a responsibility to prevent that. On the other hand, the cousin's autism might mean he doesn't understand social cues or boundaries, and the author might need to communicate differently. Maybe the author could have tried alternative methods before completely cutting off access, like setting clearer boundaries or explaining the dog's needs more thoroughly.\n\nBut in the second incident, the cousin was being insistent, leading to a dangerous situation where the dog was dropped. The author's reaction was to stop visits entirely. Was that too harsh? Perhaps there's a middle ground, like supervising visits more closely or providing a safe way for the cousin to interact without harm. However, the author might not be in the wrong if the safety of the dog is the priority. The key is whether the author's actions were necessary to prevent harm versus being overly restrictive without considering the cousin's needs.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because they're responsible for the dog's safety. However, maybe the approach could have been more empathetic. But based on the given info, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were proportionate and if they considered the cousin's disability. Since the cousin's behavior was causing harm and the author tried some methods (like offering the PS4), maybe B is correct.\n"
