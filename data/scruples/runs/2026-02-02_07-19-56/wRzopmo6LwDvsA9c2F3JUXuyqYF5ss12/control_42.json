This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and their interactions with the dog. \n\nFirst, the cousin was at the house with the dog. The dog started barking, which is unusual, and when the author checked, the dog was whimpering. The cousin was there, and the dog seems upset. Later, the cousin wants to take the dog out, but when told no, he starts a tantrum. The cousin then runs around with the dog in his arms, which wakes the dog and causes a problem. The author raises their voice, tells the cousin he might not be allowed to see the dog anymore. The cousin drops the dog, who hits the ground, and then there's a confrontation. The aunt then calls the author rude and selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his behavior and understanding. The author is trying to protect the dog, especially since the dog is 13 years old and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions could be dangerous for the dog. However, the author's response was to threaten to stop visitation, which the aunt found harsh.\n\nAutism can affect how someone processes information and manages emotions. The cousin might not understand that picking up the dog is harmful or that his actions are inappropriate. The author might have been trying to set boundaries for the dog's safety, but the way it was handled could have been more considerate of the cousin's needs. For example, maybe the author could have communicated differently, or the family could have discussed strategies for the cousin to interact with the dog safely. The cousin's tantrum might be a result of his frustration not being understood. However, the author's actions were to protect the dog, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe key points are whether the author's response was excessive given the cousin's autism and if there were alternative ways to handle the situation. The author did attempt to negotiate (offering the PS4 and going out after dinner), but when that failed, the response was to threaten to stop visitation. Maybe the author could have involved the parents or found another way to address the behavior without cutting off access entirely. But considering the immediate threat to the dog's safety when the cousin picked him up, the author might have had a valid reason to act. \n\nIn the end, it's a balance between respecting the cousin's needs and the dog's safety. The author's intentions were protective, but the method might not have been the best approach. However, the aunt's reaction might be over the top as well. So, the answer might not be clear-cut. But according to the options, it's either A (author is wrong) or B (not). Considering that the author was trying to protect the dog and the cousin's behavior was harmful, the author's actions might be justified, so the answer would be B. However, if the response was too harsh without considering the cousin's autism, then A. But since the author tried to manage the situation with a compromise, maybe B is the answer.\n"
