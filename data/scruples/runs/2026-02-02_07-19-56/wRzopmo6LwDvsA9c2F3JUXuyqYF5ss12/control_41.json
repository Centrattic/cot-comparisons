This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's autistic cousin, their dog, and some recent incidents.\n\nFirst, the cousin was with the dog, and the dog ended up barking and then whimpering. Later, the cousin is insistent on walking the dog, gets upset when denied, and ends up carrying the dog, causing it to hit the floor. The author then threatens to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the cousin's aunt.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's behavior and the author's response. The cousin is autistic, which might affect how he processes information and manages emotions. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, especially since the dog is old (13 years old) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions led to the dog being dropped, which is concerning for the dog's safety.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to threaten to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt's reaction includes mentioning that the cousin doesn't understand because he's autistic. This implies that the cousin might not grasp the consequences of his actions or the need to treat the dog gently. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect the dog, but the way it was handled (raising their voice, threatening to stop visits) might be too harsh, especially considering the cousin's autism.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author might not have considered alternative solutions that would accommodate the cousin's needs while ensuring the dog's safety. For example, setting clear boundaries with visual cues or working with the family to teach the cousin appropriate behavior. The immediate threat to cut off contact might not be the best approach, especially without prior positive reinforcement or understanding of the cousin's communication style.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for the dog's safety is valid. The dog is old and fragile, and being dropped could cause injury. The cousin's behavior, including running with the dog and not listening to previous instructions, does pose a risk. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might have been too abrupt without considering the cousin's developmental needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the aunt's criticism might have some merit if the author didn't provide adequate guidance or support for the cousin to behave appropriately. However, the cousin's actions did cross a line, and the author has the right to set boundaries to protect their pet. The balance here is between enforcing those boundaries and doing so in a way that's sensitive to the cousin's autism.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because protecting the dog is important. However, the way they handled the situation could have been more considerate of the cousin's autism. The author might have benefited from a more structured approach to teaching the cousin how to interact with the dog safely, rather than an immediate cutoff. Therefore, the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that the approach could be improved.\n"
