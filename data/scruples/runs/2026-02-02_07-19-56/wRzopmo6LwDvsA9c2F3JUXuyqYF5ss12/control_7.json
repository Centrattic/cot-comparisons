This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and the author's dog. The cousin has had a couple of incidents where he was with the dog, and the author is considering stopping him from seeing the dog again.\n\nFirst, let's look at the details. The cousin was with the dog using a laser pen, which might be a problem if the dog is stressed or injured. Then there was an incident where the cousin carried the dog while it was asleep, leading to the dog hitting the ground hard. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt is now upset, saying the author was rude and selfish.\n\nNow, the key points here are the cousin's behavior and his autism. Autism can affect how someone understands social cues and boundaries. The cousin might not realize that his actions are harmful to the dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, which is understandable. However, the cousin's actions might stem from not understanding the dog's needs or his own limits.\n\nThe author's response was to raise their voice and set a boundary, which could be seen as necessary for the dog's safety. But considering the cousin's autism, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like using more clear instructions or involving the parents earlier. The cousin's tantrum and running around might be a result of not understanding the rules or being overwhelmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's responsibility to protect their pet is valid. If the cousin can't control his behavior around the dog, it's reasonable to limit interactions. However, the way the author communicated this might have been harsh, especially if the cousin doesn't process feedback the same way neurotypical people do. The aunt's reaction might be because they feel the cousin is being unfairly treated without proper support or understanding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between the dog's safety and the cousin's needs. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to stop interactions if the cousin's behavior is harmful. But perhaps there's a middle ground, like setting up a structured environment where the cousin can interact with the dog safely, maybe with supervision. The author might not be entirely at fault, but their approach could have been more accommodating given the cousin's autism.\n"
