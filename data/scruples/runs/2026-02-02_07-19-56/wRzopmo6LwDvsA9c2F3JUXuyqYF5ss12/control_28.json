This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let me go through the details provided.\n\nFirst, the cousin is autistic. The author mentions that the cousin had a tantrum after being told he couldn't walk the dog alone. The author raised their voice, leading to the cousin dropping the dog, which then ran away. The aunt is upset, saying the author was out of order and that the cousin doesn't understand because he's autistic. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The cousin's behavior: he was insistent, had a tantrum, carried the dog while it was asleep, which the dog doesn't like. The author intervened when the dog started whimpering earlier, and then again when the cousin was running with the dog. The author's actions led to the cousin leaving without words, and the aunt is upset.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism. Autistic individuals might have different ways of processing social cues and handling stress. The cousin might not understand the boundaries or the reason for the author's anger. The author's actions might have been necessary to protect the dog, especially since the dog is old and fragile. However, the way the author handled it\u2014raising their voice and threatening to stop visits\u2014might not have been the best approach given the cousin's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is responsible for the dog's well-being. The dog is 13 years old and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions could have hurt the dog. The author's concern is valid. But maybe there's a middle ground, like setting clear, compassionate boundaries that consider the cousin's autism. The author could have involved the parents more, perhaps to explain the situation and find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be partly due to misunderstanding the situation. The author might need to communicate better, explaining the dog's needs and the cousin's behavior without assigning blame. It's a tricky balance between protecting the pet and being considerate of the cousin's condition.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect the dog, but the approach could have been more empathetic considering the cousin's autism. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether their actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The dog's safety is important, but so is the cousin's emotional state. There's a case to be made both ways, but I think the author's primary concern for the dog is valid. So the answer might be B (No), but there's room for nuance.\n"
