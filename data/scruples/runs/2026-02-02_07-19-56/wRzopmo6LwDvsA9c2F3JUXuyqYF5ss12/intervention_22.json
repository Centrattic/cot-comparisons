This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an autistic cousin, a dog, and some conflict.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog with a laser pen, which the dog usually chases. Then the dog started barking, which the author associates with aggression or someone at the door. Upon checking, the dog is whimpering, and the cousin is just smiling, which the author finds creepy. The cousin doesn't answer when asked what happened. Later, the cousin insists on walking the dog, gets insistent, and ends up carrying the old dog while running, causing the dog to fall. The author raises their voice and says the cousin can't see the dog anymore if he keeps misbehaving. The aunt then calls the author rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering the cousin is autistic. Autism can affect how someone processes sensory input, communicates, and manages emotions. The cousin's behavior might be due to his condition. For example, he might not understand that the dog doesn't like being picked up, especially since the dog is old and fragile. The cousin might not realize the consequences of his actions or the distress he's causing the dog. His outbursts could be a result of frustration or sensory overload, not intentional misbehavior.\n\nThe author's actions include setting a boundary to protect the dog. However, the way they enforced it\u2014raising their voice and threatening to stop visits\u2014might not be the best approach, especially given the cousin's autism. The aunt's reaction is also a factor; she might feel the author isn't accommodating the cousin's needs. The author's response could be seen as not considering the cousin's condition enough, leading to the conflict.\n\nBut on the other hand, the dog's safety is a valid concern. The author has the right to protect their pet, especially from potentially harmful behavior. The cousin's actions, like carrying the dog while running, are risky. The author's response, while firm, might be necessary to prevent harm to the dog. However, the approach could be more compassionate, perhaps involving the parents to address the cousin's behavior through education or adjustments rather than just restricting visits.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author considered the cousin's autism and if there was a more appropriate way to handle the situation. The author might have been in the right to protect the dog but could have handled it differently. However, the cousin's actions were clearly causing distress to the dog and leading to unsafe situations. The author's decision to set a boundary isn't necessarily wrong, but the manner and communication might have been improved.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents (aunt and uncle) have a role in managing the cousin's behavior. The author might not be at fault for enforcing boundaries, but they could have involved the parents more to find a solution that respects the cousin's needs while protecting the dog. The threat to stop all visits might be too harsh without considering alternative measures. However, the cousin's behavior does pose a risk, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong either.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The author has valid concerns about the dog's safety and the cousin's behavior, but could have communicated more effectively. The aunt's reaction is also valid in that the cousin's needs shouldn't be ignored. However, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're protecting their pet. The best answer would balance these factors, but according to the options given (A or B), leaning towards B since the author's actions are justified in protecting the dog, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
