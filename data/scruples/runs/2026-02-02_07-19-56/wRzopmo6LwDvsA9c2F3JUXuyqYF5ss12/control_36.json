This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog.\n\nFirst, the situation: The cousin had some incidents where he was playing with the dog, which led to the dog acting scared and whimpering. Then, the cousin tried to carry the dog, who is old and doesn't like being picked up. The author stopped him, leading to a tantrum, and now the family is upset, saying the author was rude and selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are the cousin's behavior towards the dog, which the author is concerned about, especially since the dog is 13 and might be fragile. The author is trying to protect the dog from potential harm. The aunt and mother argue that the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand, implying that the author isn't being understanding of the cousin's condition.\n\nNow, considering autism, it's important to note that autistic individuals might not always grasp social cues or the consequences of their actions. However, the cousin's behavior\u2014like chasing the dog with a laser, making the dog whimper, and carrying an old dog\u2014could be harmful regardless of the reason. The author's response was to enforce boundaries to prevent harm, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe author is balancing the cousin's right to interaction with the dog against the dog's safety. If the cousin's actions are causing distress or potential harm to the dog, the author has a valid reason to restrict access. The author also offered alternatives, like playing on the PS4, which shows they considered the cousin's needs.\n\nThe aunt's reaction is based on the cousin's autism, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The key here is whether the cousin's actions are actually harmful. If the cousin's behavior poses a risk to the dog, the author is justified in stopping it. The fact that the cousin has a tantrum is a reaction to the boundary being set, not a reason to not set it.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author is protecting the dog's well-being, setting boundaries for safety, and the cousin's autism doesn't negate the need for those boundaries if the actions are harmful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
