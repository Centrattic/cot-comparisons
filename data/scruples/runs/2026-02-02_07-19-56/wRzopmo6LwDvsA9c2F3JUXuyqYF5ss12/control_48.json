This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The key points from the story are:\n\n1. The cousin is autistic, which the author acknowledges.\n2. The cousin was with the dog, leading to the dog barking, then later chasing a laser, then the cousin ran with the dog in his arms, causing the dog to fall.\n3. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog if the behavior continued.\n4. The aunt called the author rude and selfish because of the cousin's autism.\n\nFirst, consider the cousin's behavior. The dog is old (13 years) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin ran with the dog, leading to a fall. The author intervened to stop potential harm to the dog and to prevent the cousin from being hurt. The author's actions seem protective of the dog's well-being. However, the cousin is autistic, which might affect how he communicates or processes situations. The aunt's reaction is based on the cousin's autism, implying that the author didn't consider his needs.\n\nBut the author had already set boundaries, warned the cousin, and tried to redirect him with the PS4. The cousin escalated the situation with a tantrum and physical actions. The author's response was to enforce the rules to protect the dog. The author's decision to restrict future visits is a consequence of the cousin's behavior, not just the autism. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nAutism doesn't excuse harmful behavior, but it's important to consider the cousin's communication style. The author might need to find alternative ways to manage the situation, like structured visits where the cousin knows the rules. However, the immediate issue was the harm to the dog. The author's actions were in response to a specific incident where the dog was injured. The aunt's reaction might be based on a lack of understanding of the situation, not the cousin's needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing the dog's safety. However, the approach could have been different. The key is whether the author considered the cousin's autism in their response. The author did acknowledge the autism but still deemed the behavior unacceptable. The balance is between enforcing boundaries and accommodating the cousin's needs. The author's final decision to stop visits might be too abrupt, but given the incident, it's understandable as a protective measure. The answer hinges on the author's intent to prevent harm versus the cousin's needs.\n"
