This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog. The author is being criticized by the aunt for not letting the cousin see the dog anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The dog, an old 13-year-old, was with the cousin, and there were incidents where the dog was in the corner whimpering after playing with the laser, and then later, the cousin was carrying the dog when he was asleep and dropped him. The author then said they would stop the cousin from seeing the dog if he continued such behavior. The aunt is upset, saying the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand.\n\nNow, considering autism, people on the spectrum might have different ways of interacting. The cousin might not realize that picking up the dog or causing it to bark is problematic. The author is concerned for the dog's well-being, especially since it's old and fragile. But they also need to consider the cousin's needs and the communication barriers due to his autism.\n\nThe key points here are: the cousin's actions that endangered the dog, the author's response, and the aunt's accusation that the author is being rude. The author might not have communicated the boundaries clearly to the cousin, given his autism. Maybe there's a lack of understanding of how to manage his behavior. However, the cousin's actions did put the dog at risk, so the author has valid concerns about the dog's safety.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a balance between protecting the pet and being considerate of the cousin's abilities. If the cousin didn't understand the rules or was unable to follow them due to his autism, the author should have found alternative solutions rather than cutting off contact entirely. Without proper support or clear communication, the cousin might not know how to interact appropriately. Therefore, the author's approach might be too harsh without considering the cousin's needs. They could have set clearer boundaries, provided supervision, or involved the family in teaching the cousin how to interact safely with the dog.\n\nSo the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't account for the cousin's autism in their response.\n"
