This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the cousin is autistic, which might affect how he interacts with others and understands boundaries. The cousin was with the dog, first chasing a laser pointer. Then the dog started barking when someone was aggressive. The cousin was silent when asked what happened. Then later, he tried to walk the dog but was insistent when told no. He started running around with the dog in his arms, which the dog didn't like and caused it to fall. The author raised their voice and said no more visits if the behavior continued. The aunt then called them rude and selfish.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's behavior and the author's response. Autistic individuals can have sensory sensitivities or communication challenges. The cousin might not grasp that the dog doesn't like being picked up, especially since it's old. The author's actions were to protect the dog and prevent harm. However, the cousin's autism might mean he doesn't understand social cues or the dog's discomfort. The author had to set a boundary to prevent potential harm, which seems reasonable. The aunt's reaction might be because they don't see the behavior as problematic or they think the cousin shouldn't be punished. But the author's priority is the dog's safety. So, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing boundaries to protect the animal, especially considering the dog's age and the cousin's actions leading to a dangerous situation.\n"
