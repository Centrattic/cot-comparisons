This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who posted about wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The cousin is autistic, and the cousin was with the dog. The dog started barking, then the cousin was smiling while the dog was whimpering. Later, the cousin insists on walking the dog, ends up running with the dog in his arms, causing the dog to hit the ground. The author then threatens to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nNow, considering autism, people might have different behaviors or reactions. The cousin's actions might stem from not understanding certain social cues or how to handle the dog properly. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, especially since it's old (13 years old). The cousin had previous incidents: once the dog was whimpering after playing with the cousin, and later the dog was dropped.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's age and autism, the dog's age and sensitivity, and the author's actions. The author is responsible for the dog's safety. The cousin's behavior seems to be causing distress to the dog, which is a valid concern. However, the author's response was to threaten to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, which might be seen as cutting off access without considering alternatives, especially given the cousin's disability.\n\nThe aunt is defending the cousin, saying he doesn't understand because he's autistic. The author might not be considering that the cousin may need more structure, supervision, or adapted interactions with the dog. Instead of a sudden ban, maybe the author could have implemented strategies like shorter visits, supervision, or teaching the cousin how to interact appropriately with the dog. The author's reaction was harsh, especially after a single incident, which might not be the best approach when dealing with someone who has autism.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's actions were harmful: dropping the dog, making it whimper, and the dog's age makes it more vulnerable. The author's priority is the dog's safety and well-being. However, the way the author handled it\u2014threatening to stop visits and having a confrontation\u2014might not be the most supportive way to manage the situation, especially given the cousin's needs. The author could be in the right in protecting the dog but in the wrong in how they handled the situation without considering accommodations or communication with the family.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's concern is valid, but their approach might lack consideration for the cousin's autism. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the dog's safety is a priority, but some might argue that they could have handled it differently. However, given the options, the correct answer is B (No), as the author is justified in protecting their dog from harmful behavior, even if the cousin is autistic.\n"
