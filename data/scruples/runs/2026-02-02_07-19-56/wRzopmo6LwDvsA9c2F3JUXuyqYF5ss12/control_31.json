This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the cousin is in the wrong for wanting to stop his autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The situation involves a few incidents where the cousin's behavior with the dog was concerning.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which the dog didn't react to normally. Then, the dog started barking, which the cousin didn't respond to when asked. Later, the cousin insisted on walking the dog, leading to the dog being carried roughly, which upset the dog. The cousin then had a tantrum, leading to a confrontation where the author threatened to stop visitations.\n\nThe cousin's mom got upset, claiming the author was rude and selfish. The key points here are the cousin's autism and the author's actions. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, especially since it's old and sensitive. The cousin's behavior was aggressive or inappropriate in handling the dog, which could be due to not understanding boundaries or the dog's needs because of his autism.\n\nHowever, the author's approach was to cut off visitation entirely after one incident. While the cousin's actions were problematic, the response might be too harsh, especially considering his autism. The cousin might need guidance rather than being banned. The author could have tried other methods, like setting clearer rules, providing supervision, or working with the family to manage the interactions better.\n\nOn the other hand, the dog's safety and well-being are important. The cousin's actions could lead to harm, so the author has a valid concern. However, the author's threat to stop all visits might be seen as too extreme without considering alternative solutions. The aunt's reaction might be influenced by the cousin's needs and the family's perspective on autism.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on balancing the dog's welfare against the cousin's needs. The author isn't entirely wrong for protecting the dog, but their approach might be too harsh without considering accommodations for the cousin's autism. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong for not exploring other options before cutting off visits.\n"
