This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves an autistic cousin who's been acting out during visits with the dog. The cousin was chasing a laser with the dog, then the dog started barking and later was found whimpering. Then the cousin wanted to walk the dog but ended up causing a scene, including running with the dog in his arms and throwing a tantrum. The author decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, which led to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cousin's behavior. The cousin is autistic, which can affect how he processes social situations and handles frustration. The author mentions that the cousin was insistent, had a tantrum, and didn't heed warnings. However, the cousin might not understand the consequences of his actions or how to regulate his behavior appropriately due to his autism. That could mean that the author's approach might be too harsh if the cousin isn't in a position to modify his behavior as expected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is responsible for the dog's well-being. The dog is old and doesn't like being carried. The cousin's actions led to the dog being dropped, which is concerning for the dog's safety. The author's decision to stop the cousin from visiting the dog could be seen as necessary to prevent harm to the animal. However, the way the author communicated this might have been abrupt without considering the cousin's needs and the family dynamics.\n\nThe aunt's reaction is also a factor here. She might feel the author is being unfair without understanding the cousin's limitations. The author should have perhaps discussed the issue with the aunt first, especially since the cousin has special needs. The immediate decision to cut off contact without a prior discussion might have caused unnecessary hurt.\n\nAnother angle is the author's responsibility as a caregiver. The dog's safety is important, but so is the cousin's emotional well-being. Maybe the author could have implemented a different strategy, like setting clear boundaries with the cousin and his family, or providing positive reinforcement for good behavior. The situation might require a more structured approach that accommodates the cousin's autism, rather than an outright ban.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about the dog's safety, the way the issue was handled might not consider the cousin's autism and the family's perspective. The author could have taken a more inclusive approach, working with the family to address the behavior without cutting off visits entirely. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the cousin's needs and the family's feelings in the decision-making process.\n"
