This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let me read through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nThe cousin is autistic, which might affect how he processes information and behaves. The author moved out, and the cousin was allowed to visit the dog. There are two main incidents: once in the living room where the dog is whimpering and the cousin is there, and another time when the cousin carries the dog, leading to the dog being dropped. The author then decides not to let the cousin visit the dog anymore. The aunt is upset, calling the author rude and selfish.\n\nSo, the author's actions are based on the dog's safety and well-being. The cousin's behavior, like not responding when asked, carrying the dog, and having a tantrum, are concerning. The author raised their voice, which might be seen as harsh, but the intention was to stop the behavior. The aunt's reaction is partly about the cousin's autism, implying he might not understand the author's instructions or the consequences of his actions.\n\nNow, considering autism, the cousin might have different sensory needs or communication challenges. He might not realize that picking up the dog is harmful or that the dog doesn't like being held. The author's job is to protect the dog, especially since it's older and fragile. The author tried to offer an alternative (PS4 and walking after dinner) which worked temporarily but then the incident happened again.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision to stop visits was justified. The author has a right to protect their pet from harm. The cousin's actions, even unintentionally, were causing distress to the dog. The author's response might be seen as necessary for the dog's safety, even if it's hard for the family to accept. However, the way the author communicated this (raising their voice, sudden decision) could have been handled more sensitively. But the final decision to stop visits is about the dog's well-being, which the author has a responsibility for.\n\nSo, balancing the cousin's needs with the dog's safety, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The aunt's reaction might be overblown, focusing on the cousin's disability as an excuse without considering the dog's health. The author's actions were protective, even if the communication could have been better. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
