This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The situation involves some specific events where the cousin's behavior caused the dog to be distressed and led to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which might be overstimulating. Then the dog barked when the cousin was with him, and the dog ended up whimpering. Later, the cousin insisted on walking the dog, got insistent when refused, then ran around with the sleeping dog in his arms. The dog was dropped, leading to the author threatening to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt then called the author rude and selfish.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's actions affecting the dog's well-being and the author's response. The cousin is autistic, which the aunt mentions as a reason for not understanding boundaries. So, the question is whether the author overstepped by restricting the cousin's access to the dog.\n\nThe author's main concern is the dog's safety and comfort. The cousin's behavior, especially carrying the dog when it's asleep and the dog being old, could be harmful. The author tried to set boundaries but faced pushback. The cousin had a tantrum and the dog was dropped. The author's response was to threaten to stop visits, which led to conflict with the aunt.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism, he might have difficulty understanding social cues or boundaries. However, the author has the right to protect their pet. The issue becomes whether the author's method of stopping future visits was appropriate. The author tried alternatives (like offering the PS4, taking him out after dinner) but the cousin's actions continued to be problematic. The threat to stop visits is a consequence, but the question is if it's justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in protecting their dog from potential harm, especially since the cousin's actions led to the dog being dropped. On the other hand, the author might not have considered alternative strategies that accommodate the cousin's needs, like closer supervision or specific training. However, the author did attempt some accommodations (PS4 offer), and the cousin's behavior escalated regardless.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be influenced by the cousin's autism, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for protecting their pet. The author isn't being cruel but is setting necessary boundaries after repeated incidents. Therefore, the author's actions are likely not in the wrong.\n"
