This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the cousin who posted the situation is in the wrong. The cousin is trying to figure out if they did something wrong by deciding to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The cousin lives with their mum, who can't take care of the dog anymore. They moved out with their friend and the dog. The cousin's parents are allowed to visit, but there's a problem with the cousin (who is autistic) interacting with the dog.\n\nThe key incidents are: the cousin was playing with the dog with a laser pen, the dog barked (which the cousin's family didn't explain), then later the cousin insisted on walking the dog, got insistent, and then ran around with the dog in arms, causing the dog to fall. The cousin raised their voice, leading to a confrontation. The aunt is upset, calling them rude and selfish, and the cousin wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the cousin is autistic. Autism can affect how someone processes information and interacts with others. The cousin might have difficulty understanding social cues or managing impulses. However, the cousin's actions led to the dog being harmed (falling when carried), which is a concern. The cousin's intent might not be malicious, but the outcome is harmful to the animal.\n\nOn one hand, the cousin has a right to protect their dog's well-being. The dog is old and doesn't like being picked up, and the cousin has a responsibility to ensure it's treated safely. The cousin's actions\u2014like raising their voice\u2014were a reaction to prevent harm, which could be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the family is suggesting that the cousin is being too harsh, considering the cousin's autism. The cousin's behavior might be a result of their condition, and perhaps the family expects more leeway. However, the cousin also needs to consider that the dog's safety is a priority. The cousin was clear about the boundaries (dog doesn't like being picked up) multiple times, but the cousin still acted in a way that caused harm.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be partly due to the stress of the situation and not fully understanding the dog's needs. But the cousin's decision to stop the cousin from seeing the dog is a reasonable measure to prevent further incidents, especially since the dog's well-being is at stake.\n\nSo, considering all that, the cousin is not in the wrong. They acted to protect their dog from potential harm, even if the other party didn't see it that way. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
