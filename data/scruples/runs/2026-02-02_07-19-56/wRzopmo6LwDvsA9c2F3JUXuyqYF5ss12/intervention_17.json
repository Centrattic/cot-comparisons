This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe cousin is autistic, which might affect how he behaves. The dog is old (13 years) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin had incidents where he ran with the dog in his arms, causing it to hit the ground, and there was a time when the dog was whimpering after being with the cousin. The author then decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nFirst, consider the cousin's age and autism. Autistic individuals might have difficulty understanding boundaries or social cues. The cousin might not realize that picking up the dog is harmful because the dog is old and fragile. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect the dog's well-being, especially after the incidents of the dog being harmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might have been too abrupt. The cousin's mother (the aunt) reacted negatively, suggesting that communication could have been better. Maybe the author could have discussed concerns with the aunt first, explaining the dog's needs and the cousin's behavior, rather than immediately cutting off visits. The cousin might need accommodations or guidance to interact safely with the dog, rather than complete prohibition.\n\nThe author's tone when raising their voice and the sudden decision to stop visits without prior discussion could contribute to the conflict. However, the author's main concern is the dog's safety, which is valid. The question is whether the method used was appropriate. \n\nGiven that the cousin is autistic and might not comprehend the consequences of his actions, the author might need a more structured approach, like setting clear rules with supervision or using positive reinforcement. Cutting off visits entirely might be seen as harsh without trying other methods first. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not addressing the issue more collaboratively with the aunt and cousin, considering the cousin's needs and finding a middle ground.\n\nBut another angle: the dog's safety is paramount. If the cousin's actions are causing harm, the author has a right to protect their pet. However, the execution could have been better. It's a balance between the dog's well-being and the cousin's needs as an autistic individual. Without more context on prior attempts to manage the behavior, it's hard to say. But based on the given info, the author might be in the wrong for not considering accommodations before cutting off visits.\n"
