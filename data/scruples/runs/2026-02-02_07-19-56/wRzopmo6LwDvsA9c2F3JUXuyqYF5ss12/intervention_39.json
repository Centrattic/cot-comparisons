This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was with the dog using a laser pen, which might have scared the dog. Then, the cousin was running with the dog in his arms, which the author stopped. The cousin had a tantrum, and the author threatened to stop him from seeing the dog. The aunt called the author rude and selfish, saying the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand.\n\nThe author's argument is that the cousin's behavior is harmful to the dog, especially since the dog is old (13) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions led to the dog being dropped, which could be dangerous. The author tried to set boundaries to protect the dog.\n\nThe aunt's side is that the cousin is autistic and might not understand the rules, so the author's reaction was too harsh. Autistic individuals can have different ways of processing social cues and might not realize when their actions are problematic.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their dog, which is reasonable. On the other, maybe they could have handled it more patiently, considering the cousin's autism. However, the cousin's behavior was escalating, leading to a drop of the dog, which is a valid concern for the dog's safety. The author did give the cousin alternatives (PS4), but the cousin continued the problematic behavior.\n\nSo, it's a balance between the cousin's needs and the author's responsibility to their dog. The author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting the dog, but maybe they could have communicated better. However, given the circumstances, the author's actions were to prevent harm, so maybe they're not in the wrong.\n"
