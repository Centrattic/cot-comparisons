This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves an autistic cousin and a dog. The author is considering stopping their cousin from seeing the dog due to some incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his behavior and how he processes things. The cousin was with the dog, causing the dog to bark and then later, when the cousin was in the house again, he dropped the dog after being told not to carry it. The author raised their voice and decided to prevent the cousin from seeing the dog anymore. The aunt called the author rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism, it's important to note that autistic individuals might have different reactions to situations, sensory sensitivities, or communication challenges. The cousin's behavior might stem from not understanding the dog's needs or his own actions' consequences. For example, the dog being old and not liking to be picked up\u2014maybe the cousin didn't realize that. Also, when the author raised their voice, the cousin had a tantrum and ran off, which could be a meltdowns due to stress or sensory overload.\n\nThe author's actions: stopping the cousin from seeing the dog is a protective measure for the dog's well-being. The dog is 13, so old and fragile. If the cousin's actions risk the dog's health, the author has a valid concern. However, the way the author handled it\u2014threatening to stop visits after raising their voice\u2014might not be the most effective or compassionate approach. The aunt's reaction might stem from feeling that the author isn't accommodating the cousin's needs due to his autism.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a balance between protecting the dog and considering the cousin's needs. If the cousin's behavior is due to his autism, the author might need to implement strategies that account for his disability, like setting clear boundaries in a calm manner, possibly with input from the parents or professionals. The author's immediate reaction to stop the cousin entirely might be too harsh without addressing the root cause. However, if the cousin's actions are harmful to the dog, the author isn't entirely wrong either.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's approach was appropriately balanced. Since the author didn't try to accommodate the cousin's needs first and instead resorted to an abrupt cutoff, which led to conflict, they might be in the wrong. But if the dog's safety is the priority and the cousin can't be properly managed, then the author has a point. However, given the autism aspect, the author should have perhaps communicated better or found a middle ground. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the cousin's needs and handled it in a way that might be seen as dismissive of his challenges.\n"
