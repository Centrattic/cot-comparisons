This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong regarding their autistic cousin and the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The cousin is autistic, and the author's family allows him to visit their dog. The author is concerned about the cousin's behavior towards the dog. There are two main incidents described. The first time, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, and when the dog barked, the author found the dog whimpering. The cousin didn't respond when asked what happened. The second incident involved the cousin carrying the dog, who doesn't like being picked up, leading to the author raising their voice and threatening to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The author's aunt then called them rude and selfish.\n\nNow, the key factors here are the cousin's age, his autism, and the author's responsibility towards the dog. The author is protecting their dog, which is 13 years old and not fond of being picked up. The cousin's behavior in both incidents could be problematic. However, since he's autistic, his understanding of appropriate behavior might be different, and he might not grasp the dog's discomfort or the rules immediately. The author's response was to set boundaries, but the cousin had a tantrum, which complicates things.\n\nThe aunt's reaction seems to be that the author wasn't understanding of the cousin's condition. The author's actions\u2014threatening to stop visits if behavior continues\u2014could be seen as reasonable for the dog's well-being, but maybe the approach wasn't considered in the context of the cousin's needs. The cousin might need more structured guidance rather than sudden threats. However, the author is also within their rights to protect their pet, especially as the dog is old and fragile.\n\nIt's a balance between the cousin's needs and the dog's safety. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but perhaps could have handled it more sensitively, considering the cousin's autism. But the immediate action of threatening to stop visits might be seen as harsh, especially if the cousin didn't understand why. However, the author's main issue is the dog's safety, which is valid. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because protecting the dog is a valid concern, but maybe there's room for improvement in approach.\n"
