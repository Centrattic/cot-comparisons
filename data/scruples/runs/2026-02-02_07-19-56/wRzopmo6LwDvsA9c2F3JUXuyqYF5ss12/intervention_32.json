This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their autistic cousin and a dog. The author is living with a friend and a dog, and the cousin is allowed to visit the dog. The problem seems to be that the cousin's behavior towards the dog is causing issues.\n\nFirst, the author describes an incident where the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pointer, leading to the dog barking. Then, the cousin started chasing the dog, and the dog ended up whimpering. The author's cousin didn't answer when asked what happened. Later, when the cousin wanted to walk the dog alone, he was insistent and even had a tantrum when denied. The cousin ended up carrying the dog, which the dog doesn't like, and the author raised their voice to say they might stop the cousin from seeing the dog. That led to the cousin having a tantrum again and running off. The aunt then called the author rude and selfish.\n\nThe author is now questioning if they're in the wrong. Their reasoning is that the cousin's behavior is problematic and they need to set boundaries for the dog's safety. But the aunt is arguing that the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand, so the author is being harsh.\n\nSo, to decide if the author is wrong, I need to consider a few things. First, the cousin's autism might affect his ability to understand boundaries or the dog's limits. The author has a responsibility to protect the dog, especially since the dog is old and might be more fragile. However, how the author communicated this is important. Raising their voice and threatening to stop contact without maybe offering alternative solutions could be seen as harsh. Also, the cousin's behavior might be a result of his autism, which might require more structured guidance rather than just punishment.\n\nBut the author has the right to set boundaries for their pet's well-being. If the cousin's actions are causing harm or stress to the dog, the author isn't wrong in wanting to stop that. The key is whether the approach taken was appropriate. If the author had a conversation with the aunt first to explain the dog's needs and set clear expectations, maybe it would have been handled better. But in this case, the author took a firm stance without perhaps enough communication with the aunt, leading to the conflict.\n\nAlso, the cousin's tantrums and the way he handled the dog (like carrying him while asleep) are concerning. The author's reaction might be justified as a way to prevent future incidents. However, the way it was handled\u2014raising their voice and using a threat\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if the cousin is autistic and might not process that feedback well. Maybe a more supportive approach, involving the aunt and possibly a behavior plan, would be better.\n\nIn terms of the aunt's reaction, she might feel defensive because of the cousin's autism. The author might need to consider that the aunt is also a parent trying to protect her child. So, the author's approach might have been too direct without involving the aunt in problem-solving.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't entirely wrong because they have the right to protect their dog. However, the way they handled the situation could be improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they took action to stop potentially harmful behavior, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the method of communication and lack of collaboration with the aunt might be where they went wrong. Hmm, tricky.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect their dog, but maybe the approach could be better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is about whether their actions are justified considering the cousin's autism, it's a balance between the dog's safety and the cousin's needs. But the author did set a boundary, which is reasonable. So maybe the answer is B, No.\n"
