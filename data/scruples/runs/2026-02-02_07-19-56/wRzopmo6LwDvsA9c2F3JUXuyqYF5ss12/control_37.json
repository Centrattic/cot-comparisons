This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and their interactions with the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cousin is autistic, which is important because autism can affect how someone behaves and understands social cues. The cousin was left with the dog, and there were incidents where the dog was stressed (barking, whimpering) and later when the cousin carried the dog while he was sleeping, causing the dog to hit the ground.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was justified in wanting to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The author's reasons are that the cousin's behavior is harmful to the dog. The cousin's family is upset, saying the author was out of line because the cousin doesn't understand things due to autism.\n\nI need to consider if the author overreacted. The cousin's actions\u2014like chasing the dog with a laser pen, which can stress the dog, and carrying the dog when he doesn't want to be picked up\u2014could be problematic. The dog is old (13 years), so handling needs to be gentle. The cousin's tantrums and physical actions might be a result of not understanding the dog's needs or his own limitations.\n\nAutism can mean that the cousin might not realize the dog is stressed or that certain actions are harmful. The author might not have considered accommodations or clear communication tailored to the cousin's needs. However, the author's responsibility to protect the dog is also valid. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nThe author did try to set boundaries, like saying no to walking the dog alone and offering an alternative. But when the cousin acted out, the author raised their voice and threatened to stop the visits. The cousin then had a tantrum. The aunt's reaction might be part of a misunderstanding of the situation, possibly not recognizing the severity of the dog's distress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The cousin's autism might require more patience and alternative strategies, but the author's concern for the dog's well-being is also valid. The author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their pet, but they might need to approach the situation with more understanding and perhaps involve the cousin's family in a constructive way to manage the behavior, considering the cousin's needs.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author is justified in protecting the dog, but the approach could be more inclusive. However, the post ends with the author deciding to not allow the cousin to visit if the behavior continues, which is reasonable. The aunt's reaction seems harsh, but the author isn't entirely without fault in communication. But the main issue is the dog's safety, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, B.\n"
