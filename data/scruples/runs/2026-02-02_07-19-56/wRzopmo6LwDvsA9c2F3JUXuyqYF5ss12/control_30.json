This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the cousin is autistic, which is mentioned. The author's cousin was with the dog, and there were incidents: the dog was acting scared, the cousin was insistent on walking the dog, then there was a situation where the cousin ran around with the dog in his arms, which upset the author. The author raised their voice and said they might stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The cousin had a tantrum, and the author had to physically stop him from going to their room. The aunt then called the author rude and selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are the cousin's behavior towards the dog and the author's response. The dog is old (13 years old) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions could be harmful to the dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and their own comfort in managing the situation. However, the cousin is autistic, which might affect how they understand boundaries or handle frustration.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a responsibility to protect their dog from potential harm. If the cousin's actions are causing stress or injury to the dog, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author's response\u2014raising their voice and threatening to stop the cousin from seeing the dog\u2014could be seen as necessary to prevent further incidents. However, the physical action of grabbing the cousin's arm might be a point of contention. Was that a reasonable response to a tantrum?\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's autism might mean that he has difficulty controlling his impulses or understanding the dog's limits. The author's approach might need to involve more communication with the aunt to find a solution that accommodates the cousin's needs while keeping the dog safe. The author's immediate decision to cut off visits might not consider the cousin's perspective, especially if he's not in a place to understand why he's being excluded.\n\nThe aunt's reaction (calling the author selfish) suggests she feels the author is overreacting, possibly due to not considering the cousin's condition. The author might have been better off discussing the situation with the aunt first to find a compromise, rather than making an abrupt decision. However, in the heat of the moment, it's understandable that the author acted to protect the dog and their own environment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's intentions are to protect the dog, which is valid. But the method of cutting off visits without prior discussion might be too harsh, especially considering the cousin's autism. There might be a better way to handle the situation that still respects the cousin's needs. However, given the immediate incident where the dog was dropped and the cousin's behavior was escalating, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary step to prevent further issues. The key is whether the author's response was proportionate. The answer could hinge on whether there was an attempt to address the behavior first before cutting off visits entirely. Since the author did try to set boundaries earlier (like offering the PS4 deal), and the cousin continued, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the abruptness of the decision and the physical intervention might tip the balance. Hmm.\n"
