This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to prevent their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The situation involves the cousin's behavior with the dog, which the author found concerning.\n\nFirst, the cousin was involved in an incident where the dog started whimpering and barking, which the author attributes to the cousin using a laser pen and then the dog being left upset. Then, later, the cousin tried to carry the dog, which the dog dislikes, leading to a tantrum and the cousin dropping the dog. The author then threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog if he continued this behavior. The aunt called the author rude and selfish, claiming the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand.\n\nNow, considering the context: the dog is 13 years old and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions, like running with the dog in his arms, could be dangerous for both the dog and the cousin. The author has a right to protect their pet, especially since the dog's well-being is a concern. However, the cousin is autistic, which might affect his understanding of appropriate behavior. The author's response was to raise their voice and threaten to stop visits, which the aunt found harsh.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author had legitimate concerns about the dog's safety and the cousin's behavior. However, the manner in which they handled it (threatening to stop visits) might come off as harsh, especially given the cousin's autism. The author might need to consider alternative solutions, like setting clearer boundaries or involving the family in a more constructive way. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author's primary concern was the dog's safety, which is valid. The cousin's actions were problematic, so the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the approach could be questioned. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer seems to be B (No), because the author is protecting their pet, albeit possibly in a heavy-handed way. However, considering the cousin's autism, maybe there's a need for more accommodation. Still, the immediate threat to the dog's safety justifies the author's stance. So the answer is B.\n"
