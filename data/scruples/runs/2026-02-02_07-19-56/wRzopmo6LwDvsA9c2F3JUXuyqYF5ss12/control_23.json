This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the cousin's uncle or something?) is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. \n\nFirst, the cousin is autistic, which might affect how he behaves and processes things. The author mentions incidents where the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pointer, then later the dog was whimpering and the cousin was smiling. Then another time, the cousin carried the old dog, causing it to hit the ground. The author tried to set boundaries, which led to a conflict.\n\nThe aunt is upset, saying the author was rude and that the cousin doesn't understand because he's autistic. The author's stance is about protecting the dog's well-being, especially since it's old and sensitive. \n\nAutistic individuals might have different ways of interacting, possibly not understanding the dog's limits or the consequences of their actions. But the cousin's behavior here seems to involve actions that could harm the dog. The author is concerned about the dog's safety and the cousin's behavior escalating. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could consider whether the cousin can be taught appropriate behavior. But given the dog's age and the incidents described, maybe the author is justified in prioritizing the dog's welfare. The cousin's tantrums and disregard for the dog's health might mean that interactions are too risky. \n\nHowever, there's a need for communication and support for the cousin. If possible, working with the family to set clear boundaries and teach the cousin how to interact safely with the dog could be a middle ground. But if the cousin can't be managed in a way that ensures the dog's safety, the author's decision might be necessary. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to protect their pet. But they could be seen as not considering the cousin's needs adequately. However, the main issue is the dog's safety. The answer might be B, but there's nuance.\n"
