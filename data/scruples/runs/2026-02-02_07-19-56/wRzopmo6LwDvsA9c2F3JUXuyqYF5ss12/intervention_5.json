This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an autistic cousin and a dog. The cousin wants to see the dog, but the author is considering stopping him after some incidents.\n\nFirst, let's look at the cousin's behavior. The cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which the dog usually chases. But the dog ended up whimpering and the cousin sat there smiling. Then later, when the cousin wanted to walk the dog, he was insistent and even had a tantrum. Then he ran around with the dog in his arms, which woke the dog up and caused him to hit the ground. The author raised their voice and said they might not let the cousin see the dog anymore. The aunt then called the author rude and selfish.\n\nNow, the cousin is autistic. Autism can affect how someone processes information, understands social cues, and manages emotions. The cousin might not fully grasp why certain actions (like carrying the dog when it dislikes it) are problematic. So, the author needs to consider whether the cousin's actions were due to not understanding the dog's needs or if there was intentional harm.\n\nThe author's actions: They tried to reason with the cousin, offered alternatives (like playing PS4 after dinner), but when the cousin acted out, they raised their voice and threatened to stop him from seeing the dog. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate given the cousin's autism. \n\nThe cousin's behavior does seem concerning. The dog was old and the cousin was carrying it, which could be dangerous. The dog was also showing signs of distress. The author has a responsibility to protect their dog's well-being. However, the way the author handled it\u2014grabbing the cousin's arm and threatening to stop all visits\u2014might not be the best approach for someone with autism, who might not understand the reasoning or react appropriately to such measures.\n\nBut the author's main point is that they don't want the cousin to continue if he acts that way. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to prevent harm to the dog. On one hand, the author is protecting their pet. On the other hand, the cousin might need accommodations or clearer boundaries explained in a way he can understand. The author could have considered working with the aunt to set up rules or perhaps find a way to let the cousin interact with the dog in a safe manner, rather than cutting off access entirely.\n\nThe aunt's reaction seems to be based on the cousin's autism and not understanding the situation. The author might need to communicate the specific incidents and why they're a problem, maybe educating the aunt on the dog's needs. However, the author's immediate reaction of threatening to stop all visits might have been too harsh, especially without first trying to address the behavior with support for the cousin.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? The author's intent was to protect the dog, which is valid. But the method of cutting off access without addressing the root cause or providing support might be the issue. The author could be seen as not fully considering the cousin's needs and capabilities due to autism. Therefore, maybe the author is partly at fault for not finding a middle ground. But the cousin's behavior was definitely problematic. It's a bit of a balance. I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to protect their dog, but they could handle it better. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is A or B strictly, considering the cousin's autism, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they can set boundaries, but the way they handled it could be improved. However, the main issue is the author's right to protect their pet, so they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
