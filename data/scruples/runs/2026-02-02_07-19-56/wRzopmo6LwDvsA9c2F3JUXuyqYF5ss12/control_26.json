This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author moved out with their dog, allowed family visits. The cousin, who is autistic, was playing with the dog. The dog didn't come to greet the author, so they checked and found the cousin with the dog. The dog was whimpering and barking, which is unusual. Then the cousin had a tantrum when told he couldn't walk the dog alone. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The cousin dropped the dog, which hit the ground hard, and then there was a confrontation. The aunt is upset, says the author was rude and selfish.\n\nSo, the main points are: the cousin is autistic, his behavior might be challenging. The dog is 13 years old and doesn't like being picked up. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being. The cousin's actions led to the dog being dropped, causing a concern for the dog's safety. The aunt is upset, blaming the author for not being accommodating to the cousin's needs.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting their dog, especially since the dog is old and sensitive. The cousin's behavior was risky, and the author tried to set boundaries. On the other hand, the cousin is autistic, and maybe his actions are due to his condition, not malice. The author's response might be seen as harsh, especially if they didn't consider how to manage the cousin's behavior in a way that's considerate of his needs.\n\nBut the key here is the safety of the dog. The author has the right to protect their pet, especially if it's being mishandled. The cousin's tantrum and the dropping of the dog is concerning. The author's threat to stop visits might be necessary if the behavior continues, but the way it was handled could be improved. However, the aunt's anger might be overblown if the author's intentions were to protect the dog. The cousin's autism is a factor, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries to ensure the dog's safety. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
