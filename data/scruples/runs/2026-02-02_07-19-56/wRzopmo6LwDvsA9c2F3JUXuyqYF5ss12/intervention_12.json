This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves an autistic cousin, a dog, and some conflict. The author moved out with their dog and allowed family to visit. The cousin was with the dog, and there were incidents where the dog seemed distressed, like barking and then being carried around roughly. The author decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cousin is autistic, which might mean he processes things differently. The author is an adult in their own apartment, responsible for the dog's safety. The cousin's behavior\u2014like chasing a laser pointer, carrying the dog roughly, and throwing a tantrum\u2014could be seen as harmful. The dog is old and fragile, so handling it roughly is a risk.\n\nBut the aunt is upset, saying the author is out of order because the cousin doesn't understand. The question is whether the author overstepped. The author's actions were to protect the dog, especially since the dog was whimpering and the cousin didn't respond when asked what happened. The author tried to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the way they enforced it might be in question. Grabbing the cousin's arm to stop him could be seen as a harsh reaction, but maybe necessary to prevent injury.\n\nAutism can affect communication and behavior. The cousin might not realize his actions are inappropriate. The author did try to redirect the cousin with the PS4 and dinner walk, but the cousin continued. The aunt's reaction is strong, but the author's priority is the dog's well-being. The author isn't allowing someone to harm their pet, which is their right. However, the communication approach might need adjustment. Maybe a more structured method for the cousin to interact with the dog safely, considering his needs. But the author isn't wrong in wanting to protect the dog. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
