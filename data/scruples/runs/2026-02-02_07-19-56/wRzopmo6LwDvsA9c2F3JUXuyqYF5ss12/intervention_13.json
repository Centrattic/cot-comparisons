This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog.\n\nFirst, the situation: The cousin is autistic, and there have been incidents where the dog was scared (chasing a laser, barking, then later being carried and dropped). The author is the dog's caretaker and is concerned about the dog's well-being and safety. The cousin's parents are upset, saying the author is being rude and selfish.\n\nThe author's actions: They stopped the cousin from seeing the dog after the incidents, leading to a confrontation. The cousin had a tantrum, and the author raised their voice. The aunt called them out for being out of order, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Autistic individuals might have different behaviors, especially during meltdowns or when overstimulated. The cousin's actions (carrying the dog, causing it to hit the ground) could be dangerous for an old dog. The author's concern for the dog's safety is valid. However, how they handled it might be an issue. Raising their voice could have escalated the situation, especially with someone on the autism spectrum who might not process social cues the same way. The author's approach might be seen as harsh, especially without considering alternative solutions, like working with the family to set boundaries or find a safer way for the cousin to interact with the dog.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's parents might have overreacted, but the author has the right to protect their pet. The key here is whether the author's decision was based on legitimate concerns for the dog's safety versus being overly strict without understanding the cousin's needs. The author might not be in the wrong if they prioritized the dog's well-being, but the method of handling it could be questioned. However, given the context, the author's actions seem justified in protecting their pet, especially after the cousin's unsafe behavior.\n"
