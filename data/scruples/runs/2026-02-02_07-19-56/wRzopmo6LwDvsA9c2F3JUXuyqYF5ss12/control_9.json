This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their cousin who's autistic wanting to see their dog, but the author is considering stopping the visits due to some incidents. First, I need to understand the key points from the story.\n\nThe author moved out with their dog, and their cousin (who's autistic) came over. There were a couple of incidents. The first time, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen. The dog started barking, then later was found whimpering in the corner, and the cousin was just sitting there smiling, which the author found creepy. The cousin didn't answer when asked what happened. Then, the next incident was when the cousin insisted on walking the dog alone, leading to the cousin running around with the dog in his arms when he was asleep. The author raised their voice, told him he might not be allowed to see the dog anymore, and the cousin had a tantrum, ran to the room, and when the mom came, the author's aunt was upset and accused them of being rude and selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. The cousin is autistic, so his behavior might be different from neurotypical people. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being. The dog is 13, old, and doesn't like being picked up, which the cousin was told multiple times but still did. The cousin had tantrums and possibly didn't understand the dog's limits. The author tried to set boundaries, but the cousin's mom (the aunt) is upset, saying the author is being rude.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their dog from potentially harmful situations. The dog is old and fragile, and the cousin's actions (like carrying it when it doesn't like it) could hurt the dog. The author tried to manage the situation by redirecting with the PS4 and taking the dog out, but the cousin didn't comply. The author raised their voice as a last resort. On the other hand, the cousin is autistic, which might mean he has difficulty processing social cues or understanding the dog's distress. The author's approach might have been too harsh without considering the cousin's needs or communication methods. The cousin's mom might feel that the author is not accommodating his condition.\n\nBut the key points here are that the dog's safety and well-being are at risk. The author's actions were in response to the cousin's behavior that could harm the dog. The cousin was told multiple times not to pick up the dog, yet he did so, leading to the dog hitting the ground. The author is within their right to set boundaries to protect their pet, especially if the cousin's actions are unsafe, regardless of his autism. The author did try to offer alternatives, but the cousin's behavior escalated. The aunt's reaction might be overstepping, but the author's main responsibility is to their dog. So, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They are prioritizing the dog's safety over the cousin's desire to see it, given the risks involved.\n"
