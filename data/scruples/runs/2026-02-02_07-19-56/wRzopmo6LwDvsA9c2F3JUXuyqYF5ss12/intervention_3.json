This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and the author's dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was allowed to visit the dog initially. The first incident was when the cousin was playing with the dog with a laser pointer, and then the dog started barking. The author found the dog whimpering and the cousin smiling, which was concerning. Then, the second incident was the cousin carrying the dog, which the dog didn't like, leading the author to raise their voice and set a boundary. The cousin had a tantrum, and the author threatened to stop visits. The aunt then called the author rude and selfish.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's behavior, his autism, and the author's response. The cousin's actions\u2014like chasing with a laser, which can stress the dog, and then carrying the dog, which the dog dislikes\u2014could be harmful, especially since the dog is old (13 years). The author is trying to protect the dog's well-being. However, the cousin is autistic, so his behavior might not be intentional or understood the same way. The author's response was to set boundaries, which is reasonable for the dog's safety. But the way the author communicated this might have been harsh, leading to the cousin's tantrum and the subsequent conflict with the aunt.\n\nThe author's intentions seem to be in the dog's best interest. However, the cousin's autism means that his actions might not be malicious. The author could have considered alternative approaches, like more communication with the aunt beforehand, or finding a way to accommodate the cousin's needs while still protecting the dog. But the cousin's behavior did cross into harmful territory, so the author's decision to stop the visits isn't entirely unjustified. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more diplomatically. Maybe explaining the situation to the aunt first, or providing a safe way for the cousin to interact with the dog. The cousin's tantrum might be a result of frustration or not understanding the rules, which is common in autistic individuals. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the dog, but could have handled the communication better. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions were necessary given the dog's well-being versus the cousin's needs. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting the dog, but perhaps could have been more considerate in their approach. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
