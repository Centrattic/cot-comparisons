This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author moved into a new apartment with their friend and the family dog. The cousin visits and interacts with the dog. There are incidents where the dog is barking, then later the cousin is carrying the dog, which the dog doesn't like, and the author gets upset. The author tells the cousin that if he keeps up the behavior, he can't see the dog anymore. The cousin has a tantrum, and the author's aunt calls them rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering the cousin is autistic, which might affect how he processes information and handles emotions. The author's actions might be seen as too harsh if the cousin can't control his impulses. But on the other hand, the author has a right to protect their dog, especially since the dog is old and might be harmed by rough handling. The dog was injured when the cousin dropped it after a tantrum. That's a significant point. The author tried to set boundaries but maybe the approach was too abrupt. However, the cousin's behavior was escalating, so the author had to take action to prevent harm.\n\nThe aunt's reaction is also part of the situation. The cousin's parents might not see the author's actions as justified, thinking it's a communication issue rather than misbehavior. But the author's main concern is the dog's well-being. The author did try to compromise before (like offering the PS4), but the cousin kept pushing boundaries. The author's tone when raising their voice might have been too much, especially for an autistic person who might be sensitive to loud noises or sudden changes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the cousin can't control his impulses and the author is protecting the dog, maybe they're justified. But the way the author handled it\u2014threatening to stop visits might be too harsh without considering the cousin's needs. But given the incident where the dog was dropped, it's a safety issue. The author had to act to prevent harm.\n\nHmm. The key factors here are the dog's well-being and the cousin's autism. The author's actions might be seen as necessary for the dog's safety, but maybe they could have communicated differently. However, the option to stop visits altogether might be a last resort after multiple incidents. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because protecting the dog is a valid reason, especially when there's a risk of harm.\n"
