This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin, a dog, and some conflict between the cousin and the author.\n\nFirst, the cousin was allowed to see the dog by the author's mom. The author moved out, took the dog, and let the mom visit. Then there's an incident where the cousin is playing with the dog using a laser pen, and the dog ends up whimpering. Later, the cousin starts a tantrum, carries the dog while it's asleep (which the dog doesn't like), and the author raises their voice, leading to a confrontation. The aunt then calls the author rude and selfish.\n\nThe author's cousin is autistic. Autistic people can have different behaviors and reactions. The cousin might not understand boundaries as well as others, or might not process social cues the same way. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, especially since it's old and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions could be harmful to the dog, even if he's not intentionally being mean.\n\nThe author's actions: they tried to stop the cousin from playing roughly, told him no, offered a compromise (PS4 time). When the cousin continued, the author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The cousin had a tantrum and the author had to physically restrain him. The aunt is upset, saying the author was out of order because the cousin doesn't understand.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the cousin's autism and the author's responsibility towards the dog. The author is trying to protect the dog from potentially harmful behavior, but the cousin might not be able to control his impulses. The author's response was to raise their voice and threaten to stop visits, which might be seen as harsh given the cousin's disability. However, the cousin's actions (carrying the dog when he's not supposed to) could risk the dog's safety.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing the dog's safety over the cousin's needs? Or is the author wrong for not accommodating the cousin's needs, considering his autism? It's a balance between the two. The author's actions might be justified if the cousin's behavior is genuinely harmful, but the way they handled the situation (raising their voice, threatening to stop visits) might be too abrupt, especially if the cousin doesn't process discipline in the same way. The aunt's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe the author should have communicated better with the aunt beforehand.\n\nIn autism, communication and behavior can be different. The cousin might not understand why he can't carry the dog, even after being told. The author's method of discipline might not be effective for an autistic person. The author could have tried different strategies, like explaining the consequences more clearly or involving the aunt to manage the situation better. However, the cousin's actions did lead to the dog being dropped, which is a valid concern for the author.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong because they have a right to protect their dog. But their approach might have been too harsh, not considering the cousin's autism. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were proportionate and appropriate given the cousin's needs. Alternatively, the author might be in the right to set boundaries for the dog's safety, even if it upsets the cousin and family.\n"
