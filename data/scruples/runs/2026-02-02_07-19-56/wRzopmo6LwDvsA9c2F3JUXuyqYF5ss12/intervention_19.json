This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was left in charge of the dog with a laser pointer. The dog then started barking, which led to the cousin being left alone. Later, the cousin insisted on walking the dog alone, leading to a tantrum when refused. The cousin ended up carrying the dog, who was old and didn't like being held, causing the dog to fall. The author then threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's behavior and the author's response. The cousin is autistic, which might affect how he processes information and behaves. The author's actions include raising their voice, grabbing the cousin's arm, and threatening to stop visits. The aunt's reaction suggests that they believe the cousin's behavior is misunderstood due to his autism.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the cousin was being aggressive and disrespectful towards the dog, especially when the dog is old and sensitive. However, the cousin's behavior might stem from his autism, possibly not understanding boundaries or the dog's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a responsibility to protect the dog's well-being. If the cousin is causing stress or harm, the author is justified in setting boundaries. However, the way the author handled the situation\u2014raising their voice and grabbing the cousin\u2014might not be the best approach, especially considering the cousin's autism.\n\nThe aunt's criticism centers around the author not understanding the cousin's needs. This highlights a communication gap. The author should consider working with the family to find a safe way for the cousin to interact with the dog, perhaps with supervision or alternative activities that accommodate his autism.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention to protect the dog is valid, the method and communication might be flawed. The cousin's needs as an autistic individual should be considered, and a more collaborative approach might be better. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in handling the situation.\n"
