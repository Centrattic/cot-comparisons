This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was with the dog, and the dog started barking. The author found the dog whimpering and the cousin acting creepily. Then the cousin insisted on walking the dog alone, had a tantrum, and ended up dropping the dog. The author threatened to stop him from seeing the dog, which led to a confrontation and a call from the aunt accusing the author of being rude.\n\nThe author's cousin is autistic. Autism can affect how someone handles emotions, sensory input, or understands social cues. The cousin might not comprehend the dog's needs or the consequences of his actions. For example, the dog being old and not liking being picked up. The cousin's actions, like carrying the dog, might be due to sensory overload or stimming.\n\nThe author's response was to raise their voice and threaten to stop visits. But considering the cousin's autism, maybe there's a need for more understanding and alternative solutions. The aunt's reaction might be justified if they didn't consider the cousin's condition when addressing the behavior. The author could have sought a different approach, like explaining the situation in a way the cousin understands or working with the family to manage the behavior without cutting off access entirely.\n\nHowever, the author has the right to set boundaries for their dog's well-being. If the cousin's actions are consistently harmful, some restrictions make sense. The key is whether the author considered the cousin's autism and tried accommodations first. The way the situation escalated, with the author grabbing the cousin's arm, might not be the best approach for someone who processes things differently.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about the dog's safety, their handling of the situation might not have been considerate of the cousin's autism. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't adapt their approach to the cousin's needs.\n"
