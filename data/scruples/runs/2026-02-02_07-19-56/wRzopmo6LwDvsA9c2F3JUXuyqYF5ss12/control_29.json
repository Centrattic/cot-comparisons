This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog. The author wants to stop the cousin from seeing the dog after some incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cousin was with the dog and the dog started barking. Then the cousin was insistent on walking the dog alone, ended up running with the dog in his arms, which led to the dog being dropped. The author raised their voice and said they might not allow the cousin to see the dog anymore. The aunt called the author rude and selfish.\n\nThe cousin is autistic. So, maybe his behavior is a result of his condition. Autistic individuals might have different social behaviors, sensory sensitivities, or communication differences. The cousin might not understand the dog's limits, like not liking to be picked up. The author's actions might be seen as overreacting if the cousin's behavior stems from his autism and not from malice.\n\nHowever, the author is responsible for the dog's safety. The dog is old (13 years) and doesn't like being carried. The cousin's actions could have been harmful. The author tried to set boundaries, but perhaps in a way that wasn't accommodating to the cousin's needs. For example, maybe the author could have tried to guide the cousin's behavior without completely cutting off interaction, especially considering the cousin's autism.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be because she thinks the cousin can't help his behavior. The author's response of threatening to stop seeing the cousin could be seen as harsh without considering the cousin's disability. Maybe there's a middle ground, like working with the aunt to teach the cousin appropriate interactions or setting clear, compassionate boundaries.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they have the right to protect their dog. But the way they handled the situation could have been better, considering the cousin's autism. The aunt's criticism might stem from misunderstanding the author's intentions. The author's main concern is the dog's well-being, which is valid, but perhaps they need to approach the situation with more understanding and communication with the family.\n"
