This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an autistic cousin and the author's dog. The cousin was allowed to see the dog, but there were incidents where the dog was upset and the cousin had a tantrum. The author is considering stopping the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nFirst, the cousin is autistic. That's important because autism can affect how someone behaves and understands social cues. The author mentions the cousin had a tantrum when told he couldn't walk the dog. Autistic individuals might have difficulty with transitions or changes in routine, so this behavior might be a response to frustration rather than willful disobedience.\n\nThe first incident: the dog was whimpering while playing with the laser pen. Then the cousin was quiet when asked about it. The author didn't see the interaction but noticed the dog's distress. Maybe the cousin didn't realize his actions were causing the dog to be scared. Autistic people might not pick up on others' emotional states as easily, so the cousin might not have known the dog was upset.\n\nThe second incident: the cousin ran around with the dog, which the dog dislikes. The author raised their voice, leading to a tantrum. The cousin tried to run to the author's room, so the author had to physically stop him. This seems like a safety issue. If the cousin is acting out of frustration, the author's reaction might be about protecting the dog and preventing harm. However, shouting and grabbing the cousin's arm could be seen as harsh, especially if the cousin is autistic and might not handle stress well.\n\nThe aunt's reaction: she said the author was out of order and called them rude and selfish. The aunt might feel the author isn't accommodating the cousin's needs. But the author is concerned about the dog's well-being and their own safety. The author's decision to not allow the cousin to visit anymore could be seen as necessary if the cousin's behavior poses a risk. However, maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like setting clearer rules or communicating with the aunt first instead of abruptly cutting visits.\n\nAutistic individuals might need more structure and clear communication. If the cousin wasn't taught how to interact with the dog properly, the incidents might be preventable with education rather than punishment. The author might need to consider if their approach is too strict or if they could provide support instead of just halting visits.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's actions (like carrying the dog and causing it distress) are concerning. The author has the right to protect their dog and ensure their home is a safe environment. If the cousin's behavior is unpredictable and potentially harmful, the author's decision to stop visits could be justified. However, the way the author handled the situation\u2014raising their voice, grabbing the cousin's arm\u2014might be seen as overly reactive, especially without considering the cousin's needs.\n\nIn summary, the author's intentions might be to protect the dog and maintain order, but their approach could have been more considerate of the cousin's autism. The key is balancing the dog's safety with the cousin's needs. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a responsibility to their pet, but maybe they could have handled it differently, like collaborating with the aunt to address the behavior issues first. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
