This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The situation involves the cousin having behavioral issues during visits, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cousin is autistic, which might affect how he processes information and behaves. The author mentions that the cousin was playing with the dog, which led to the dog barking, then later the cousin was running with the dog in his arms, causing the dog to be startled. The author intervened, raised their voice, and said the cousin can't see the dog anymore. The aunt is upset, calling the author rude and selfish.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Autistic individuals can have different social and sensory processing, which might lead to behaviors that are misunderstood. The cousin's actions might be due to his autism\u2014perhaps he didn't realize that picking up the dog was harmful, or that his excitement was causing distress. The author's response was to stop future visits, which might be seen as a harsh reaction if the cousin didn't understand the rules.\n\nHowever, the author is also responsible for the dog's well-being. The dog is old and fragile, and the cousin's actions could be dangerous. The author's concern for the dog's safety is valid. The cousin's behavior escalated to the point where the dog was dropped, which could be harmful. The author's decision to stop the visits might be seen as necessary to protect the dog.\n\nBut the way the author handled the situation could be a factor. Raising their voice and making an immediate decision without considering the cousin's needs might have been too abrupt. The aunt's reaction might stem from feeling that the cousin wasn't given appropriate support or understanding.\n\nBalancing both sides: the author has a right to protect their pet, but the approach might not have been the most considerate given the cousin's autism. There might be alternative solutions, like setting clearer boundaries with the cousin's parents, or providing a structured environment. However, the cousin's actions were harmful, so the author's stance isn't entirely without merit.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. The author isn't entirely at fault because protecting the dog is reasonable, but there might be a lack of accommodations for the cousin's needs. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the cousin's autism and the immediate reaction, the answer might lean towards the author being in the right (B) but possibly needing to handle it more sensitively. But since the options are A or B, and the question is if the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because the author's actions were to protect the dog, which is valid.\n"
