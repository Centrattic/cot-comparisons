This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation from the author's perspective. They moved into a new apartment with their friend and the family dog. The cousin is allowed to visit the dog, which the author's mother had agreed to. However, the cousin's behavior becomes problematic. There are two main incidents: once when the dog is whimpering after playing with a laser pen and the cousin is unresponsive, and another when the cousin carries the dog while it's asleep and then has a tantrum when reprimanded. The author raises their voice and threatens to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt then calls the author rude and selfish.\n\nThe cousin is autistic, which might affect how he processes and responds to situations. Autistic individuals can have sensory sensitivities, communication differences, and might react differently to stress. The cousin's actions could be due to his autism, not just defiance. For example, not understanding why he can't pick up the dog or handling it in a way that's overwhelming for him.\n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid because the dog is old and fragile. The cousin's actions could be harmful. The author is responsible for the dog's well-being, so they have a right to set boundaries. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate given the cousin's needs. Did the author consider accommodations or alternative solutions before cutting off visits entirely?\n\nThe author tried to redirect the cousin with the PS4 offer, which is a good approach. But after the incident with the dog being dropped, they decided to stop visits. Maybe there's a middle ground, like working with the family to find a way for the cousin to interact with the dog safely, considering his autism. The author might not be in the wrong for protecting the dog, but they could have taken steps to support the cousin's needs while maintaining safety.\n\nThe aunt's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing rules that protect their pet. The challenge is balancing the cousin's needs with the dog's safety. The author might not be at fault, but could improve communication with the family to find a solution that works for everyone.\n"
