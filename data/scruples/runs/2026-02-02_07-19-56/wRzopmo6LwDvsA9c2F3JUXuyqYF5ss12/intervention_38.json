This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and their behavior around the family dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cousin was with the dog, and there were incidents where the dog was acting strangely. The cousin was insistent on walking the dog, then ran around with the sleeping dog in his arms, leading to the author raising their voice and threatening to stop visits. The author's aunt called them rude and selfish, which led to the question of whether they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism. Autistic individuals can have different ways of processing social cues and may not understand the consequences of their actions. The cousin might not grasp that picking up the dog is harmful, especially since the dog is old. The author's actions\u2014raising their voice, threatening to stop visits\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if the cousin isn't in a position to understand typical social boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author is also responsible for their dog's well-being. If the cousin's actions are genuinely harmful, the author has a right to protect their pet. But the approach might have been too abrupt. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting clear boundaries or working with the aunt to educate the cousin, rather than an immediate cutoff.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be based on the cousin's needs and the family's perspective. They might feel the author isn't accommodating the cousin's autism. The author's response could have been more compassionate, considering the cousin's condition. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and finding a solution that considers the cousin's needs while protecting the dog.\n\nBut then again, if the cousin's behavior is consistently harmful, the author isn't wrong to set limits. It's a balance between the cousin's needs and the dog's safety. The answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the author possibly being in the wrong due to the harsh response without considering the cousin's autism more thoroughly.\n"
