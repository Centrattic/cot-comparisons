This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. \n\nFirst, the cousin is autistic. The author mentions that the cousin has had incidents where he was playing roughly with the dog, which is an old dog (13 years old). The cousin was using a laser pointer, which the dog chased, and then there was an incident where the cousin carried the dog while it was sleeping, leading to the dog being dropped. The author had to take action by raising their voice and stating that if the behavior continues, the cousin can't see the dog anymore.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about protecting the dog from potential harm. The cousin's mother (the aunt) reacted negatively, saying the author was out of order because the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand. The author is questioning if they're being an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the situation: Autistic individuals can have different sensory processing and communication styles. The cousin's actions were harmful (dropping the dog, rough play), which could be dangerous for the dog. The author was trying to ensure the dog's safety. However, the way the author communicated this\u2014raising their voice and threatening to stop visits\u2014might not have been the best approach, especially considering the cousin's needs. \n\nBut the core issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to protect the dog. The cousin's behavior was problematic, and the author has the right to set boundaries for their pet's safety. However, the method of communication and understanding the cousin's autism is important. The author might need to find a more compassionate approach, but the intention to stop harmful behavior isn't inherently wrong. \n\nThe aunt's reaction is also a factor. The author might have needed to explain the situation in a way that the aunt could understand, possibly seeking professional advice if the cousin needs behavior modification. But the author's stance on safety isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, while the author might have handled the situation better with more empathy and communication, the desire to protect the dog isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
