This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their autistic cousin and their dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was with the dog, and there were incidents where the dog was barking, then later the cousin was running with the dog in his arms, causing the dog to fall. The author decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, which led to conflict with their aunt.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's behavior and the author's response. The cousin is autistic, which the aunt mentions as a reason for his behavior. The author's actions might be seen as protective of the dog's well-being, especially since the dog is old (13 years old) and doesn't like being picked up. The incidents described\u2014like the dog whimpering and the cousin causing it to fall\u2014could be valid concerns for the dog's safety.\n\nHowever, considering the cousin's autism, there might be aspects of his behavior that are beyond his control or understanding. The author might not have considered alternative approaches to manage the situation, such as supervision, setting clear boundaries with the cousin, or finding ways to accommodate his needs while ensuring the dog's safety. The author's response was to cut off contact, which might be seen as harsh if the cousin didn't understand the consequences of his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to protect their pet. If the cousin's behavior repeatedly endangered the dog, the author's decision could be justified. It's also important to consider whether the author communicated their concerns to the cousin's parents beforehand and if they tried to find a middle ground rather than an immediate cutoff.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be influenced by the fact that the cousin is autistic, so they might perceive the author's actions as not taking into account the cousin's needs. However, the author's responsibility to care for their dog is also valid. The balance here is tricky. The author might not be in the wrong if their primary concern was the dog's safety and they had warned the cousin and his family about the dog's preferences. But if there was a lack of prior communication or if the cousin's behavior was a one-time incident, the author's response could be seen as too severe.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be justified in protecting their pet, but there could be a better way to handle it, like working with the family to find a solution that respects both the dog's needs and the cousin's condition. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether cutting off the cousin entirely was the right move. Given the repeated incidents and the dog's age and sensitivity, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
