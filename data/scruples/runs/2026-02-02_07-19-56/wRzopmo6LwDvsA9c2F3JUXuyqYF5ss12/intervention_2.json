This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin and the author's dog. The author is questioning whether they made a mistake by deciding to stop the cousin from seeing the dog after some incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cousin is autistic, which might affect how he behaves and processes information. The author moved the dog to their apartment because their mom couldn't care for him. The cousin was allowed to visit the dog. The incidents include the cousin playing with a laser pen, which made the dog bark, and then later carrying the dog, which resulted in the dog being dropped. The author then threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. The cousin's behavior seems problematic\u2014playing with the laser pen, not responding when asked, and carrying the dog roughly. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, especially since the dog is 13 years old and sensitive. However, the cousin is autistic, which might mean he doesn't fully understand boundaries or consequences.\n\nThe author's response was to cut off the cousin from seeing the dog. But is that the right approach? There might be alternative ways to handle the situation, like setting clear boundaries, explaining the dog's needs, or involving the aunt in finding a solution that considers the cousin's needs. The author's immediate threat to stop visits might be seen as harsh without first addressing the behavior through teaching or adjusting the environment to accommodate the cousin's autism. The cousin's tantrum and the way he was stopped (grabbing his arm) could also be a point of contention, as it might not be the best approach for an autistic child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to protect their dog's safety. The incidents described do pose a risk. The aunt's reaction is also part of the issue, but the author's response might have been too abrupt without considering the cousin's special needs. The key is balancing the dog's well-being with the cousin's needs, possibly through more structured supervision rather than an outright ban.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be seen as too harsh without addressing the root causes. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions are to protect the dog, but there's a case to be made for A because the approach might not be appropriate given the cousin's autism. The answer could be in the middle, but since the options are A or B, I need to decide based on the balance of these factors.\n"
