This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the cousin is autistic. The author has a dog that's 13 years old, which is mentioned as being old. The cousin was left with the dog and then there were incidents. The first time, the dog was whimpering, and the cousin was sitting there smiling. The author is worried about the dog's behavior. Then, the cousin tried to carry the dog while it was asleep, causing it to hit the ground hard. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism, maybe he doesn't understand boundaries or how to interact properly with the dog. The author's actions\u2014raising their voice, grabbing the cousin's arm\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if the cousin is sensitive. The author's aunt is upset, calling them rude and selfish. But the author is also trying to protect an old dog from potential harm. The cousin's behavior was dangerous (carrying an old dog when he's asleep), so the author had a reason to intervene. However, the way they handled it might not have been the best approach. Maybe they should have explained the rules more clearly and set boundaries before things escalated. Also, communicating with the aunt about the concerns beforehand could have helped. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the dog's safety is a valid concern. The key is whether the response was appropriate given the cousin's needs. Since the cousin is autistic, the author might need to be more patient and find a way to manage the situation without being confrontational. However, the immediate actions taken by the author might have been necessary to prevent further harm to the dog. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but the author's intentions are to protect the dog, which is reasonable. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing the dog's well-being, but the approach could have been better. However, the aunt's reaction might stem from misunderstanding the situation. The author isn't the asshole here, but maybe they could improve their communication.\n"
