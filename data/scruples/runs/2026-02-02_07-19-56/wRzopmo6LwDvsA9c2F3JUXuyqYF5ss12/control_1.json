This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was allowed to see the dog because the author's mom was upset when they moved out. The cousin had two incidents: one where the dog was whimpering after playing with a laser pen, and another where the cousin was running with the dog in his arms, leading to the dog being dropped.\n\nThe cousin is autistic, which the aunt mentions as part of the reason for his behavior. Autistic people can have different communication styles and might not process social cues the same way. The cousin's behavior might be due to not understanding the dog's discomfort or the boundaries around handling the dog.\n\nIn the first incident, the dog was whimpering, which could indicate distress from the laser pen or possible rough handling. The cousin didn't respond when asked what happened, which might be due to sensory overload or communication difficulties. The second incident involved the cousin carrying the dog, which the author warned against. The cousin's tantrum might be a result of feeling deprived of an activity he enjoyed, and the author's reaction (raising their voice) could have escalated the situation.\n\nThe aunt's response was defensive, citing the cousin's autism. The author's decision to stop the cousin from seeing the dog is based on safety concerns for the dog, especially since the dog is old and fragile. However, the cousin's behavior might be a result of his neurodivergence, not malice. The author could have tried alternative approaches, like more structured supervision or clear rules with visual aids, considering the cousin's needs.\n\nThe key points are the cousin's age, autism, and the dog's safety. The author's actions were to protect their dog, but they might not have considered accommodations for the cousin's condition. The conflict arose from unmet expectations and lack of communication strategies. The aunt's blame on the author might be valid if the author didn't account for the cousin's needs, but the author's priority was the dog's well-being.\n\nSo, the balance here is between the author's responsibility to protect their pet and the cousin's needs due to autism. The answer isn't black and white, but the author isn't entirely in the wrong either. They acted out of concern for the dog, but could have approached the situation with more understanding of the cousin's perspective. However, the main issue is the dog's safety, which the author prioritized correctly.\n"
