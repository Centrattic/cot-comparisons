This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin, a dog, and some incidents where the cousin's behavior caused the dog to be upset. The author wants to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, and the aunt is upset, saying the cousin doesn't understand because he's autistic.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his understanding of social cues or how to interact appropriately with the dog. The cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which the dog didn't like (barking only when someone is aggressive or the intercom buzzes). Then the cousin was running around with the dog in his arms, which the dog didn't like, leading the author to raise their voice and threaten to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The cousin had a tantrum and ran off, and the aunt is now upset, calling the author rude and selfish.\n\nKey points to consider: The cousin's age and autism might mean he doesn't grasp why his actions are problematic. The author's responsibility is to protect the dog, which is old and sensitive. The cousin's actions could be harmful to the dog's well-being. However, the author's response was to threaten to stop visits, which the aunt perceives as harsh, given the cousin's needs.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is prioritizing the dog's safety and well-being. The cousin's behavior was inappropriate and could harm the dog. The author tried to manage the situation with rewards (PS4 time) but the cousin escalated. The author's actions seem reasonable to prevent further incidents. However, the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice and threatening to stop visits\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially without considering the cousin's autism and need for clear communication and support.\n\nBut the author also has the right to protect their pet. The issue is balancing the cousin's needs with the dog's well-being. The aunt's reaction might be overreacting, but the author's approach could be seen as not accommodating the cousin's autism. Maybe the author should have communicated better, provided clearer guidelines, or worked with the aunt to support the cousin's behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're protecting their pet, but there's room for a more considerate approach that addresses the cousin's needs. However, given the situation, the immediate action to stop visits is justified to prevent harm. The answer might be B (No, not in the wrong) because the author has a valid reason to protect the dog, but the handling could be better. However, considering the cousin's autism and the aunt's reaction, there's a case for A as well. But the main responsibility is to the dog's safety, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
