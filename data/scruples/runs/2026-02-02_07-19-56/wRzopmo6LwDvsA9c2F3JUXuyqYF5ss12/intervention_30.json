This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves an autistic cousin, a dog, and some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author moved out and took the family dog. The cousin is allowed to see the dog, but there are incidents. The first incident: the dog was with the cousin chasing a laser, then the dog started barking and whimpering. The cousin didn't answer when asked. Then the next day, the cousin tried to walk the dog but got insistent and had a tantrum. The author told him he might not be allowed to see the dog again if he continued. The cousin then ran around with the dog, which is old and doesn't like being picked up. The author raised their voice, the cousin dropped the dog, had a tantrum, and then the aunt called the author rude and selfish.\n\nThe cousin is autistic, so maybe he doesn't understand boundaries or his actions. The author is concerned about the dog's safety, especially since it's old. But the way the author handled the situation might be seen as harsh, especially after the cousin had a tantrum. The aunt's reaction might stem from defending her son's needs, considering his autism. The author might have been justified in protecting the dog but perhaps the approach was too abrupt or didn't consider the cousin's needs.\n\nThe key points here are: the cousin's autism affects his ability to understand the situation, the author's actions led to a confrontation, and the communication might have been lacking. The author might have been right in wanting to protect the dog but could have handled it with more empathy and alternative solutions instead of threatening to stop visits. The answer might depend on whether the author considered the cousin's condition and communicated better. But the aunt's reaction suggests that the author's approach was too harsh. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't account for the cousin's needs and used a harsh method. Alternatively, if the cousin's behavior was genuinely harmful to the dog, maybe the author isn't (B). But given the context, the author might have been too quick to cut off access without trying other strategies first. So leaning towards A.\n"
