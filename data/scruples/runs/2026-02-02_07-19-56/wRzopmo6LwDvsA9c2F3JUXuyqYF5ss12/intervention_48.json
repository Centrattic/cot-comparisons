This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin who had incidents with the family dog, leading the author to decide against allowing the cousin to see the dog again. The author received backlash from the aunt, who claims the cousin doesn't understand things because he's autistic. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cousin was with the dog, using a laser pointer, which led to the dog barking. Then, later, the cousin ran around with the dog in his arms, causing the dog to hit the ground. The author reprimanded him, leading to a conflict. The aunt is upset and accused the author of being rude and selfish.\n\nThe author's actions: He told the cousin he couldn't see the dog anymore after the behavior. The aunt's argument is that the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand. The author's defense is that the dog is old and sensitive, and the cousin's actions could harm him.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism, the author's actions might be seen as not accommodating the cousin's needs. Autism can affect how someone processes information and exhibits behaviors. If the cousin's behavior is a result of his autism, the author might need to adapt their approach rather than cutting off interaction entirely. However, the author's concern about the dog's safety is valid, especially since the dog is old and vulnerable.\n\nThe author's response was to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, which might be seen as a harsh measure without considering the cousin's abilities and the possibility of supervision. The aunt might argue that the author should have involved the cousin's parents or provided a clearer explanation. The author's communication style (raising their voice, grabbing the cousin's arm) could be problematic, especially for someone with autism who might be more sensitive to stress or sudden actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to protect their pet. The cousin's behavior was dangerous, and the author felt the need to set boundaries. However, the method of enforcing those boundaries might have been too abrupt without prior discussion or understanding the cousin's condition. The author might have acted without considering that the cousin's behavior is a result of his autism and not just disobedience.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, family dynamics play a role. The author's parents might have a say in how the cousin is treated. The author's response to the aunt's call by saying they can't have the cousin over anymore might be seen as cutting off the cousin's visitation without a middle ground. The author could have asked for more supervision or set clearer boundaries with the family instead of an outright ban.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the cousin's autism and not handling the situation with more understanding and communication. The author could have sought a solution that both protects the dog and allows the cousin to interact safely, perhaps with supervision. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
