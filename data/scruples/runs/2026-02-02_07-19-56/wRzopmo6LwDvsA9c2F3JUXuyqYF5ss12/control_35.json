This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog. The cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which might not be safe. Then there's an incident where the cousin carries the dog while it's asleep, leading to the dog hitting the ground. The author then decides to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, which leads to conflict with the aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the safety of the dog. The dog is 13, so old and possibly more fragile. Carrying an older dog that doesn't like being picked up could be harmful. The cousin's behavior, like running around with the dog, might be dangerous. The author has the right to protect their pet from potential harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin is autistic. The aunt mentions that he doesn't understand, implying that he might not realize his actions are wrong. The author needs to consider how to manage the situation with sensitivity, maybe through clear boundaries or alternative ways for the cousin to interact safely with the dog. However, the author's main concern here is the safety of their dog and their own home environment. \n\nThe cousin had a tantrum and the author had to physically stop him. That's a sign of escalating behavior. The author's response to stop visits is a protective measure. While it's important to be considerate of the cousin's needs, the author isn't necessarily wrong in setting limits to ensure the dog isn't harmed. The aunt's reaction might stem from not seeing the immediate danger or misunderstanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their dog's safety. However, there might be a better approach in the future, like working with the family to find a safe way for the cousin to interact with the dog. But in this specific scenario, the actions taken were to protect the pet, so the answer is B.\n"
