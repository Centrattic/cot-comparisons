This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The situation involves the cousin's behavior around the dog and the author's response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author moved out and brought their dog. They allowed family visits. The cousin is autistic. The first incident was the dog barking and whimpering after being with the cousin, then later the cousin ran around with the dog in his arms, leading to a confrontation. The author then threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, which upset the aunt. The aunt said the author was out of order because the cousin is autistic.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The cousin's behavior seems problematic. The dog was upset and then dropped. The author tried to set boundaries, but the cousin has autism. Maybe the cousin doesn't understand social norms or how to handle the dog properly. The author's actions were to protect the dog's well-being, but they might not have considered the cousin's needs or how to accommodate his autism.\n\nThe author's response was to threaten to stop visits, which upset the family. The cousin's autistic traits might affect his ability to control his impulses. The author might not have communicated the rules clearly or provided alternative ways for the cousin to interact with the dog safely. For example, maybe the cousin could have supervision or specific instructions on how to handle the dog. The author's approach might have been too abrupt, considering the cousin's condition.\n\nHowever, the cousin's actions did cause harm (the dog being dropped and injured possibly), so the author has a right to protect the dog. The key is whether the author's method was appropriate. Since the cousin is autistic, the author might need to approach it with more patience and understanding, perhaps working with the family to set boundaries that are clear for the cousin. The author's response might have been harsh without considering the cousin's limitations.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely at fault for wanting to protect the dog, but their method of handling the situation could have been better. The aunt's reaction might be due to feeling that the cousin wasn't given enough support. The author should have considered the cousin's needs and maybe found a middle ground instead of an immediate cutoff. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not accommodating the cousin's autism while enforcing rules.\n"
