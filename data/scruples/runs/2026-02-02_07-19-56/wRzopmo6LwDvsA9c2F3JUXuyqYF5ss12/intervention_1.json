This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog. The author is considering stopping the cousin from seeing the dog after some incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cousin has been with the dog, but there were a couple of incidents. The first time, the dog was acting strangely, then when the cousin was chasing a laser pen. The dog ended up whimpering, and the cousin was smiling, which the author found creepy. Then later, the cousin was being insistent about walking the dog, leading to a situation where the cousin ran around with the dog in his arms, causing the dog to hit the ground. The author then raised their voice and said they might not allow the cousin to see the dog anymore. The aunt called the author rude and selfish.\n\nThe author is autistic, which might affect how the cousin processes the situation. Autistic people can have sensory issues or difficulties understanding social cues. The cousin might not realize that picking up the dog is harmful or that his actions are causing distress. The author's concern is about the dog's well-being and safety, especially since the dog is old and delicate. However, the cousin's behavior might be due to his autism rather than willful misbehavior.\n\nThe author's response was to threaten to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt is upset, saying the cousin doesn't understand because of his autism. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking that stance.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to protect their dog. The dog is old and vulnerable. The cousin's actions, like carrying the dog when it's asleep and then dropping it, could be harmful. The author's actions are to prevent further incidents, which is reasonable for the dog's safety. On the other hand, the cousin's autism might mean he doesn't understand the consequences of his actions. The author might need to consider accommodations or better communication rather than cutting off interactions entirely.\n\nThe author's handling of the situation could be seen as too harsh if the cousin's behavior is due to his neurodivergence. Instead of threatening to stop visits, maybe finding a way to manage the interactions safely would be better. However, if the cousin's behavior is genuinely dangerous and the author has already tried other methods without success, then protecting the dog is justified.\n\nIt's also possible that the author didn't consider the cousin's needs and communication style. For example, using clear, direct instructions, visual supports, or positive reinforcement might help the cousin understand the boundaries. The author's approach of raising their voice and making an ultimatum might not be effective with an autistic individual, who might not process the situation the same way.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on balancing the dog's safety against the cousin's needs. If the author acted without considering the cousin's autism and didn't explore other options first, they might be at fault. However, if the cousin's actions are genuinely harmful and the author has tried other methods, then their decision is understandable. The key is whether the author took appropriate steps for the situation given the cousin's condition.\n"
