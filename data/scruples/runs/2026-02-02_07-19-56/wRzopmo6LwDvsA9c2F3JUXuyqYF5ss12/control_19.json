This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the cousin is in the wrong for wanting to stop his autistic cousin from seeing his dog. The situation involves the cousin's behavior towards the dog and the resulting conflict with the aunt.\n\nFirst, the cousin moved out and his mom can't take care of the dog anymore. They allowed the aunt to visit the dog. The cousin, who is autistic, was playing with the dog using a laser pointer. Then the dog started barking when someone was being aggressive, which led to the dog being whimpering. The cousin didn't respond when asked what happened. Later, the cousin tried to walk the dog but was insistent, leading to the dog being carried and then dropped. The cousin had a tantrum, and the author threatened to stop visits. The aunt is upset, saying the cousin is autistic and doesn't understand, and called the author rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's actions: using a laser pointer (which can be stressful for dogs), not responding to questions, carrying the dog which he dislikes, and having a tantrum. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, especially since the dog is old and doesn't like being held. The author tried to set boundaries by threatening to stop visits if the behavior continues.\n\nThe aunt's argument is that the cousin is autistic, implying he might not understand the consequences of his actions. However, the cousin's actions (tantrum, not listening, carrying the dog) seem to cross into harm or distress for the dog. The author is protecting the dog's welfare, which is a valid concern. However, the way the author handled it\u2014threatening to stop visits abruptly and the outburst\u2014might have been harsh, but the underlying reason is about the dog's safety.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the cousin's actions are causing harm, the author is justified in setting boundaries to protect the dog. However, the approach might need to consider the cousin's needs, maybe through guidance or supervision. But the key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the cousin's behavior was problematic and the author is acting in the dog's best interest, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But the author's response could be more empathetic. However, the core of the question is about whether the author is wrong for wanting to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The author's main issue is the dog's well-being, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
