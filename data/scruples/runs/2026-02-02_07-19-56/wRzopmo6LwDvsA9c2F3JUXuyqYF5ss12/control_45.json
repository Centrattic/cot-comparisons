This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the cousin was left with the dog during a visit. The dog didn't greet the author as usual, leading to a discovery that the cousin was using a laser pen to make the dog chase. Then, the dog barked, which is unusual, and the cousin was found smiling. The author intervened and noticed the dog was whimpering. Later, the cousin tried to take the dog out by himself, got insistent when told no, and ended up carrying the dog, causing it to hit the floor. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to an argument with the aunt.\n\nThe cousin is autistic, so his behavior might be influenced by his condition. The key points here are the cousin's actions towards the dog and the author's response. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, especially considering its age (13 years old). The cousin's actions, like chasing the dog with a laser, carrying the dog when it doesn't like being picked up, and the resulting injury when the dog was dropped, are problematic. \n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary to protect the dog. However, the way they communicated this might have been abrupt. The aunt's reaction might be partly due to the cousin's special needs, so the author should consider explaining the situation with empathy. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting the dog. The cousin's behavior was harmful, and the author has a right to ensure the dog's safety. The author might need to approach the situation with more understanding and perhaps work with the family to find a solution that respects the cousin's needs while keeping the dog safe. However, the immediate action to stop the cousin isn't wrong.\n"
