This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has an autistic cousin who was allowed to visit the dog. There were a couple of incidents. The first time, the dog was in the living room with the cousin, and when the author arrived, the dog was whimpering. The cousin didn't explain anything and left. The next incident involved the cousin carrying the dog, who is old and doesn't like being picked up. The author raised their voice and mentioned stopping the cousin from seeing the dog. The cousin then had a tantrum and the author had to physically stop him. The aunt is upset, saying the author was out of order because the cousin is autistic.\n\nThe author now is conflicted. They think they might be in the wrong, but the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, what's the key here? The cousin has autism, which might affect how he processes situations. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being. The dog is old and sensitive. The cousin's behavior\u2014like chasing with a laser, picking up the dog, causing it to hit the ground\u2014could be harmful. However, the author's response might be too harsh considering the cousin's condition. The aunt is using the autism as a reason to blame the author. \n\nBut the author did take measures to prevent harm, like telling the cousin no and offering alternatives. However, the physical intervention (grabbing the cousin's arm) might be crossing a line, even if it was to stop a tantrum. Also, the author's communication might not have considered the cousin's need for clear, understanding guidance rather than punitive actions. The cousin might not understand the consequences or the author's anger. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to protect their dog. The dog's safety is a valid concern. The cousin's behavior was escalating, and the author was trying to set boundaries. However, the way the author handled it (raising their voice, threatening to stop visits, physical restraint) might not be the best approach for an autistic individual, who might react more strongly to such methods. \n\nIt's a balance between the dog's well-being and the cousin's needs. The author's actions might be seen as necessary for the dog, but the method could be problematic. So, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. The author's intentions were to protect the dog, but the approach might not have been considerate of the cousin's autism. The aunt's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe she's not supporting the author's boundaries. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to stop the visits if the cousin's behavior is harmful. However, the way they handled it could be improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), because they were trying to protect the dog, but the approach could be better. But some might argue the author is in the wrong for not accommodating the cousin's needs better. Hmm. The initial thought is that the author is not in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
