This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin who had an incident with the dog, and the author wants to stop the cousin from seeing the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dog is old (13 years) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin, who's autistic, was playing roughly with the dog using a laser pen, then later carried the dog while he was asleep. The author intervened, raised their voice, and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt is upset, calling the author rude and selfish.\n\nAutism can affect how someone processes social cues and behaves, especially in stressful situations. The cousin might not understand boundaries or the dog's discomfort. The cousin's actions led to the dog being frightened and then physically harmed when dropped. The author's concern is about the safety of the dog, especially since it's elderly and fragile.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their pet's well-being. The dog was whimpering and in distress. The cousin's behavior escalated to a tantrum and physical handling that could injure the dog. The author's response was to set a boundary to prevent future harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's autism might mean he has different social understanding. The author could have considered alternative methods, like explaining the dog's needs more clearly or working with the aunt to find a safe way for the cousin to interact. However, in the moment, the author's reaction was to stop immediate harm. \n\nThe author's main issue is whether they overstepped by cutting off all contact. Maybe a middle ground could have been better, like supervision during visits. But given the incident where the dog was dropped after a tantrum, the author's decision might be justified to prevent future incidents. The aunt's reaction might be missing the immediate harm the cousin caused. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in the dog's best interest. The cousin's autism is a factor, but the author's responsibility is to protect their pet. The author could have handled it differently, like involving the family more in a solution, but the decision to stop the cousin isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
