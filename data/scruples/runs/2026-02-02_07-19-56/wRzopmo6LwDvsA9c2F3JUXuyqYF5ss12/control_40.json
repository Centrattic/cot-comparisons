This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin, a dog, and some conflict.\n\nFirst, the cousin had incidents where he was playing with the dog, leading to the dog barking and then later running around with the dog in his arms. The cousin is autistic, which the aunt mentions as part of the situation. The author decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog after the cousin had a tantrum and dropped the dog.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the cousin's behavior towards the dog (which was old and sensitive), the author's actions to protect the dog, and the cousin's autism being a factor. The aunt is upset because she thinks the author is being unfair due to the cousin's autism.\n\nThe author tried to set boundaries, like not allowing the cousin to walk the dog alone. When the cousin misbehaved, the author raised their voice and threatened to stop visits. The aunt called the author rude and selfish. \n\nNow, considering that the cousin is autistic, he might have difficulty understanding social cues or managing his emotions. The author had to balance the cousin's needs with the dog's well-being. The dog is old and doesn't like being handled, which could mean the cousin's actions could hurt the dog. \n\nThe author's main concern seems to be protecting the dog from harm. However, they might not have considered the cousin's developmental needs, maybe without proper communication with the family first. Maybe there's a middle ground, like finding a way to allow visits with supervision or specific guidelines. \n\nBut the author did try to address the behavior by offering alternatives (PS4 time) and setting clear rules. The cousin's behavior escalated beyond that, leading to the dog being dropped. The author's response was to cut off visits, which might be too harsh if there's a way to manage the situation with additional support for the cousin. However, if the cousin's actions are genuinely harmful, the author has a right to protect the dog. \n\nThe aunt's reaction might be overreacting, but the author could have handled it differently, like discussing with the family first or providing more context about the dog's needs. Still, the core issue is the cousin's behavior impacting the dog's safety. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to protect the dog, which is reasonable. But maybe the approach was too abrupt without considering the cousin's autism. However, given the incidents described, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions were to prevent harm to the dog, even if the method could be improved. Alternatively, if the author didn't consider the cousin's needs enough, it could be A. But given the dog's safety is a priority, B seems more likely.\n"
