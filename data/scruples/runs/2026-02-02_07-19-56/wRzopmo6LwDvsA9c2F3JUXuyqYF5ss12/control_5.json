This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the cousin who posted the situation is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation involves the cousin taking the author's dog, an autistic person, and the dog's behavior. The cousin allowed their cousin to play with the dog using a laser pen, which led to the dog barking and then whimpering. Later, the cousin insisted on walking the dog by themselves, ended up running around with the older dog in their arms, causing the dog to fall and then a tantrum. The author then decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to conflict with the aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cousin's intentions. They mentioned that the dog is old (13 years old) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions, like running with the dog, could be dangerous. The dog's age and preferences are important factors here. The cousin was trying to protect the dog's well-being by stopping the cousin from handling it improperly.\n\nHowever, the cousin's approach of cutting off visits entirely might be seen as harsh. The aunt's response about the cousin being autistic is also a factor. People with autism might process information differently, so the cousin's strictness could be seen as not accommodating the cousin's needs. The cousin could have tried other methods first, like setting clear boundaries or involving the parents earlier. But on the other hand, ensuring the dog's safety is a valid concern.\n\nBalancing the dog's welfare against the cousin's needs: the cousin did warn the cousin about the dog's preferences. The cousin's actions led to the dog being harmed, so their decision to protect the dog might be justified. However, the way they enforced it without considering the autistic cousin's communication style might be a problem. Maybe the cousin could have communicated more patiently, but the immediate threat to the dog's safety might make their actions understandable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), because the cousin is protecting the dog's well-being, which is valid, even if the approach could be improved. But there's a case for A if the cousin didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity to the autistic cousin's needs.\n"
