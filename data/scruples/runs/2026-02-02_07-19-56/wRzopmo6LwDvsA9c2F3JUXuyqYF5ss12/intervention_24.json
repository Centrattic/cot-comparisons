This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a family dog. The author is considering stopping the cousin from seeing the dog due to some incidents.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which the dog usually chases. Then, the dog barked, which is unusual, and the cousin was left alone with the dog. The author found the dog whimpering and the cousin smirking, which was concerning. Later, the cousin tried to take the dog for a walk but was insistent, leading to the dog being carried while asleep and the author raising their voice. The cousin had a tantrum, dropped the dog, and the author threatened to stop him from seeing the dog. This upset the family, who accused the author of being rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering the cousin is autistic, his behavior might be a result of his condition. The author's actions were in response to what they perceived as misconduct. But the cousin's mother and aunt are upset, thinking the author is being too harsh. The key points are: the author's safety concerns for the dog, the cousin's potential lack of understanding due to autism, and the communication between the families.\n\nThe author's actions seem to be protective of the dog, which is their responsibility. However, the way they handled it\u2014threatening to cut off visits\u2014might not be the best approach, especially if the cousin's behavior is due to his autism. The author might have needed to address the behavior without cutting off contact immediately, perhaps through better communication or setting clear boundaries with the family.\n\nBut the cousin's actions\u2014dropping the dog, which is old and fragile\u2014could justify the author's concern. The author tried to reason with the cousin before, offering alternatives like playing video games. The problem is whether the author overreacted or if the cousin's behavior was genuinely problematic. Since the cousin has autism, he might not grasp the dog's limits or the consequences of his actions. In such cases, the family should have informed the author about the cousin's specific needs and how to manage interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is responsible for the dog's well-being. If the cousin's behavior is a recurring issue and the family isn't addressing it, the author has a right to set boundaries. However, cutting off visits entirely might be too harsh without trying other solutions first. The author might have been in a difficult position, balancing responsibility to the dog and being considerate to the cousin's condition.\n\nIn the end, it's a complex situation. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if the dog's safety is a priority, but the approach could have been more considerate towards the cousin's needs. The answer likely depends on whether there was prior communication about how to manage the cousin's interactions with the dog and if the author gave the family enough time to address the behavior before cutting off visits.\n"
