This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author's cousin is autistic, and the author wants to stop him from seeing their dog. The main points here are the cousin's behavior during visits and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pointer, which the dog didn't like. The dog barked, which the author associates with aggression or distress. Then the cousin left without explaining what happened. Later, the cousin took the dog from sleep, ran around with him, leading to the dog being dropped and then the cousin had a tantrum. The author threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog if he continued, which led to the aunt being upset and calling the author rude.\n\nNow, the cousin is autistic. Autism can affect how someone processes sensory input and responds to situations. The cousin might not understand that certain actions are harmful or inappropriate. The laser pointer chase might be stimulating for him, and the dog's barking could be a warning sign he doesn't notice. The running with the dog could be due to overexcitement or not understanding the dog's aversion to being picked up.\n\nThe author's actions include raising their voice, threatening to stop visits, and physically grabbing the cousin's arm. These actions could be seen as harsh, especially considering the cousin's needs. The aunt's reaction points out that the cousin doesn't understand, so the author might not have accommodations in place. However, the author has valid concerns about the dog's safety and well-being.\n\nThe key question is whether the author handled the situation appropriately. The author has a right to protect their dog, but the approach taken might not be the most effective or compassionate given the cousin's autism. The author could have considered alternative strategies, like redirecting the cousin's behavior or communicating more effectively with the family about the dog's limitations. However, the immediate threat to the dog's safety might justify the author's decision to set boundaries.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were in response to the cousin's behavior, which was harmful. However, without adapting the approach to the cousin's needs, the author might have overreacted. The answer depends on whether the author's response was proportionate and accommodating. Given that the cousin is autistic and the author didn't seem to have a plan to address his specific needs, the author might be in the wrong for not being more understanding. On the other hand, the dog's safety is important. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because the response might not have been adjusted for the cousin's condition, leading to a harsher punishment than necessary. So answer A.\n"
