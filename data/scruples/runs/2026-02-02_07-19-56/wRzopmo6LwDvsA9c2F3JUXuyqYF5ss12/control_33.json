This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an autistic cousin and interactions with the dog. The author wants to stop the cousin from seeing the dog after some incidents.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen. Then the dog started barking, which the author interprets as a sign of distress. The dog ended up whimpering, and the cousin was just sitting there smiling. The author feels creeped out. Later, the cousin insisted on walking the dog but was insistent and had a tantrum. The author tried to manage by offering an alternative, but then the cousin ran with the dog in his arms, which the dog didn't like because he's old and sensitive. The author raised their voice, leading to the cousin having a tantrum and trying to run to the room. The author had to grab the cousin's arm to stop him. The aunt then called the author rude and selfish, saying the cousin doesn't understand because he's autistic.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism, the author might not be fully aware of how to interact with the dog. Autistic individuals can sometimes have sensory sensitivities or have difficulty reading social cues, which might lead to unintended behaviors. The cousin's actions could be due to not understanding the dog's body language or being overstimulated. However, the author is responsible for the dog's well-being, especially since the dog is old and fragile. The dog was showing signs of distress: whimpering, barking, and not wanting to be picked up. The author's reaction to stop the cousin from seeing the dog might be justified to protect the pet.\n\nBut then, the author raised their voice and physically restrained the cousin. That could be seen as a harsh response, especially if the cousin is autistic and might not process the correction well. The aunt's reaction mentions that the cousin doesn't understand, so the author might need to consider alternative methods of communication or involve a professional to help manage interactions. The key point is whether the author's actions were necessary for the dog's safety versus being overreactive. The author's intention is to protect the dog, which is reasonable, but the method might not have been the best approach given the cousin's needs. It's a balance between the dog's well-being and the cousin's developmental challenges. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to stop interactions that are harmful, but maybe the way it was handled could be improved. However, based on the description, the author's main concern is the dog's safety, so the decision to limit contact isn't without merit. So, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for a more compassionate approach.\n"
