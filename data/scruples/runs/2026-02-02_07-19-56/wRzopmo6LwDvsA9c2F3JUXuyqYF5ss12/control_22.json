This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin has a history of problematic behavior: once the dog was whimpering after playing with the laser pen, and then he carried the dog while asleep, causing the dog to get dropped. The author intervened to protect the dog's well-being, especially considering the dog is 13 years old and sensitive.\n\nThe author's cousin is autistic, which might affect his understanding or behavior. The aunt argues the cousin doesn't understand that the dog is old and delicate. But the author's main concern is the safety and comfort of their dog. They set boundaries after incidents that could harm the dog, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe cousin's behavior escalated, leading to a tantrum where the dog was dropped. The author's response was to enforce a rule to prevent further harm. While the cousin's needs are important, the author isn't responsible for the cousin's actions outside their control. The key point is balancing the cousin's access with the dog's safety. The author isn't being cruel but is setting necessary limits after repeated issues. The aunt's reaction might be more about the cousin's rights, but the author's actions are justified to protect their pet.\n"
