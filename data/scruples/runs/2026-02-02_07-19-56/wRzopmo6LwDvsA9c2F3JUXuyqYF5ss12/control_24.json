This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author moved out with their dog because their mom couldn't take care of him. They allowed their cousin to visit the dog, which their mom was happy about. Now, the cousin is autistic. The cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pointer, which the author found concerning because the dog didn't come to greet them as usual. Then the dog barked when someone was being aggressive, and the cousin was smiling, which the author found creepy. They told the cousin to sit with his mum, and he left without a word. The dog then came up to the author wagging its tail, which might indicate he was okay after being alone.\n\nNext, the cousin asked to walk the dog by himself. The author said no, and the cousin became insistent, almost a tantrum. The author offered an alternative: playing PS4 and going out after dinner. The cousin then ran around with the dog in his arms, which woke the dog up, and the author raised their voice. The cousin dropped the dog, who hit the ground hard, and ran to the author's room. The author had to grab his arm to stop him. When the cousin's mom picked him up, she called the author rude and selfish, saying the cousin doesn't understand because he's autistic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his behavior and understanding. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, especially since the dog is old (13 years old). The cousin's actions, like chasing with the laser and carrying the dog, could be harmful. The author tried to set boundaries but the cousin didn't respect them, leading to a stressful situation. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop visits, which the cousin's mom took offense to.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their dog, which is their responsibility. The dog is old and might not handle rough handling well. The cousin's behavior seems to have escalated, and the author acted to prevent harm. Autistic individuals can have difficulty understanding social cues and may act out due to sensory issues or stimming. The laser pointer could be overstimulating for the dog. The cousin's tantrum might be a result of frustration, not malice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial response was to tell the cousin to sit with his mum, which the cousin did. Then, when the cousin insisted on walking the dog, the author offered a compromise. However, when the cousin ran with the dog, the author raised their voice and threatened to stop visits. The cousin's mom took it as rude and selfish, possibly because the author didn't consider the cousin's autism in their approach. The cousin might not understand the threat or the author's frustration, leading to a meltdown.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author's actions were justified considering the cousin's autism. The author may not have handled the situation with enough understanding. For example, instead of threatening to stop visits, maybe they could have explained why the behavior was a problem and offered alternatives. Autistic individuals might need clearer explanations and structured approaches. The author's friend was present, but maybe they could have intervened to help manage the situation. Also, the cousin's mom might feel that the author is targeting her son because he's autistic, which could be a valid concern if the author's approach was not empathetic.\n\nIn terms of the dog's welfare, the cousin's actions could be dangerous. Carrying a dog that doesn't like it, especially an old one, is risky. The laser pointer chasing might not be appropriate either. But the author's response might have been too harsh, especially if the cousin was having a meltdown. The cousin's mom might perceive the author's actions as not accommodating her son's needs, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, the author's intent was to protect the dog, which is valid, but the method might have been too abrupt without considering the cousin's communication style and needs. The cousin's autism might require more patience and a different approach to behavior management. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with enough understanding and accommodation for the cousin's condition.\n"
