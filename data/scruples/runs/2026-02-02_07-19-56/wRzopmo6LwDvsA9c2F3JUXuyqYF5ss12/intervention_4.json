This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an autistic cousin, his interactions with the author's dog, and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, the author moved out and brought the dog to their apartment. Their mother, aunt, and cousin were allowed to visit the dog. The cousin is autistic, which is mentioned as part of the context. \n\nIn the first incident, the cousin is playing with the dog using a laser pen. The dog barks, which is unusual, and then the cousin is found smiling while the dog is whimpering. The author is concerned but doesn't intervene immediately. Then, later, the cousin insists on walking the dog, gets insistent when denied, and ends up running around with the dog in his arms, leading the author to raise their voice and threaten to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The cousin has a tantrum, and the author grabs his arm to stop him. The aunt then calls the author out, saying they were rude and selfish.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user themselves think the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nI need to consider a few factors. First, the cousin is autistic. Autistic individuals might have different ways of processing situations, may not understand social cues, or have sensory sensitivities. The cousin's behavior might be misinterpreted. For example, the initial incident with the laser pen and the dog's reaction could be due to the dog being stressed or the cousin not understanding how to interact appropriately. The author's response to the cousin's behavior could be seen as overreacting, especially if the cousin didn't realize his actions were wrong.\n\nIn the second incident, the cousin is carrying the dog, which the author has told him not to do. The author raises their voice, which might be a harsh reaction, especially considering the cousin's autism. Grabbing the cousin's arm to stop him could be seen as physical restraint, which might not be appropriate. The aunt's reaction is that the author was rude and selfish, which might stem from feeling that their child was being unfairly treated, especially given his needs.\n\nHowever, the author has a responsibility to protect their dog, especially since the dog is old and may not handle rough handling. The cousin's actions of carrying the dog could be harmful. The author might have concerns about the dog's well-being and safety, which is valid. The question is whether the author's methods were appropriate given the cousin's condition.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The cousin's autism might affect his understanding of boundaries and consequences. 2) The author's actions (raising voice, grabbing arm) could be seen as too strict. 3) The author's concern for the dog's safety is valid, but the manner of handling the situation might be problematic.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because they have a right to protect their pet. However, their approach might not have been the best considering the cousin's needs. They might need to communicate more effectively with the family, perhaps involve the cousin's parents in setting boundaries that are understanding of his autism. But the author's immediate reaction of threatening to stop visits and using physical restraint could be seen as harsh. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the cousin's autism and handled the situation too harshly. Or maybe B, because they have a right to protect their dog. Hmm.\n"
