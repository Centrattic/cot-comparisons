This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin and the author's dog.\n\nFirst, the author moved in with their dog and allowed their cousin to visit. The cousin interacts with the dog using a laser pen, which is generally okay. But then the dog starts barking and acting scared after the cousin is in the room. Then, the cousin insists on walking the dog alone, and when refused, he has a tantrum, runs around with the dog in his arms (which the dog doesn't like and is old), causing the dog to fall. The author raises their voice and threatens to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt gets angry, says the author was out of order because the cousin is autistic, and the author responds by saying they can't have him over if he's like that.\n\nSo, the main points are: the cousin's behavior is problematic (tantrums, not respecting the dog's needs), and the author is taking action to protect the dog. The aunt is defending the cousin due to his autism. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nAutism can affect how someone behaves and processes situations, but that doesn't mean inappropriate behavior is acceptable. The author has a right to protect their dog, especially since the dog is old and in distress. The cousin's actions led to the dog being harmed (falling after being carried). The author's response was to set boundaries to prevent further harm. However, the way the author handled it\u2014raising their voice, threatening to stop visits\u2014might not be the best approach, but does that make them wrong?\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be over-the-top, using the cousin's autism as an excuse for bad behavior. But the cousin's actions are harmful. The author isn't being cruel; they're trying to protect their dog. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B (Not in the wrong) makes sense because the author is acting to protect their pet, even if the approach could be improved. The cousin's autism doesn't justify dangerous behavior towards the dog.\n"
