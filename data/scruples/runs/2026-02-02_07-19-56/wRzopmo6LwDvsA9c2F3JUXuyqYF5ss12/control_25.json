This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The situation involves a cousin with autism who had some incidents with the dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which might be stimulating for him but potentially stressful for the dog. Then, the dog barked, which the author associates with aggression or alarm. When they checked, the dog was whimpering and the cousin was just smiling, which the author found creepy. Later, the cousin tried to walk the dog but ended up carrying him while he was asleep, which the dog didn't like. The author got upset and told the cousin he might not be allowed to see the dog anymore. The cousin had a tantrum, and after that, the aunt accused the author of being rude.\n\nThe author's main concern is the well-being of the dog. The dog is 13 years old, so it might be more sensitive. The cousin's actions, like carrying the dog while he's asleep and causing him to fall, could be harmful. The author is trying to protect the dog from potential harm, which seems reasonable. However, the cousin has autism, which might mean he doesn't fully understand the consequences of his actions or how to interact appropriately with the dog. The author's approach was to set boundaries, but the cousin's mother and aunt didn't agree, calling them rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has a right to protect their pet, especially if the cousin's behavior is causing distress or danger. On the other hand, the cousin's autism might mean he needs more guidance or structured interactions rather than being prohibited entirely. The author could have considered alternative solutions, like supervised visits or teaching the cousin how to interact with the dog safely. However, after multiple incidents, the author might feel that the only way to prevent harm is to stop the visits. \n\nIt's a balance between the dog's safety and the cousin's emotional needs. The author isn't being cruel, but they are prioritizing the dog's well-being. The aunt's reaction might stem from not understanding the severity of the incidents. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their pet, especially after repeated problematic behavior. So the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
