This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin and the author's dog. The cousin was allowed to visit the dog, but there were incidents that led the author to want to stop his visits.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which might be overstimulating. The dog barked, then later was found whimpering. The author noticed the cousin was smiling, which they found creepy. Then the cousin was insistent on handling the dog, leading to a tantrum and the dog being dropped when he was asleep. The dog is 13, so fragile.\n\nThe author raised their voice, threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, and then the cousin's mother (the aunt) called the author rude and selfish, citing the cousin's autism. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points: The cousin's behavior was inappropriate, leading to the dog being harmed. The author tried to set boundaries, which the cousin didn't respect. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his understanding of appropriate behavior. The aunt is defending him, possibly not addressing his behavior properly.\n\nThe author's actions: They tried to reason with the cousin, offered alternatives (PS4), but when the cousin escalated, they raised their voice. The threat to stop visits was after the cousin physically harmed the dog. The author is in a position to protect their pet, especially an old one. However, considering the cousin's autism, maybe the approach could be more accommodating. But the cousin's actions were harmful regardless of his condition. The author isn't responsible for the cousin's behavior but has the right to protect their dog. The aunt's reaction seems dismissive of the actual incidents. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
