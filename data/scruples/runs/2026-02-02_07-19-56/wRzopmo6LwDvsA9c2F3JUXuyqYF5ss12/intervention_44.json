This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation details. The author's cousin is autistic, and there have been incidents where the cousin interacted with the dog in ways that caused the dog distress. The cousin chased the dog with a laser pointer, then later ran around with the dog in his arms, causing the dog to hit the ground. The author then threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog if he continued such behavior. The cousin's mother called the author rude and selfish.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions are justified. The cousin's autism might affect his understanding of how his actions impact the dog and others. The author is concerned about the dog's safety and well-being, especially since the dog is old (13 years). The cousin had a tantrum and didn't respond well to being told no. The author tried to set boundaries, but the cousin's mother is upset, thinking the author is being unkind.\n\nI need to consider if the author is overstepping or if they're protecting the dog. On one hand, the cousin's behavior is problematic and potentially harmful to the dog. On the other hand, the cousin has a disability that might require more patience or alternative approaches. The author's response was to threaten to stop visits, which might be seen as harsh, especially if the cousin's actions are due to his autism.\n\nThe author did try to offer alternatives, like playing the PS4 and going for a walk after dinner. However, when the cousin escalated his behavior, the author raised their voice and took a firm stance. The cousin had a tantrum, which might be a result of his autism, and the mother is upset, thinking the author is unkind.\n\nI think the key point is whether the author's actions were necessary to protect the dog, considering the cousin's condition. The author might need to have a more structured approach, maybe working with the family to teach the cousin appropriate behavior, rather than cutting off access suddenly. However, the cousin's behavior was harmful, and the author has a right to protect their pet.\n\nBut maybe the author should have communicated better with the cousin's parents first, rather than making an immediate threat. The cousin's mother feels disrespected, which might affect their relationship. However, the dog's safety is also important. So there's a balance between protecting the pet and being considerate to the cousin's needs.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, I think it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions are to protect the dog, which is valid. But their method might not be the best approach given the cousin's autism. However, the cousin's actions were dangerous, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might need to find a middle ground, like setting up rules with the family's input, rather than an immediate cutoff. But based on the information given, the author isn't necessarily the asshole. So the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
