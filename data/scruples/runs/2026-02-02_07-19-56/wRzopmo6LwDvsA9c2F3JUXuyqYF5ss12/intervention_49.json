This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin and a dog. The cousin was playing with the dog with a laser pen, then later the cousin was carrying the dog around, which led to the dog being dropped. The author decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the cousin's autism. People with autism might process situations differently. The cousin might not realize that carrying the dog is harmful, especially if he's younger. The author mentioned that the dog is 13 years old and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin might not understand that the dog is fragile or that his actions could hurt it. So the author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect the dog.\n\nBut then again, the cousin was trying to interact with the dog in a way that's inappropriate. The author tried to reason with him by offering alternatives, like playing on the PS4. However, when the cousin was insistent and even ran around with the dog, causing the dog to be dropped, the author reacted by raising their voice and threatening to stop visits. The cousin had a tantrum, which is a common reaction for someone with autism when their expectations are disrupted.\n\nThe aunt is upset, claiming the author was rude and selfish. The author's reasoning is based on protecting the dog's well-being. But is there a better way to handle it? Maybe involving the cousin's parents first, or explaining the dog's needs to the cousin in a way he can understand. However, the author did try to mediate by offering alternatives and setting boundaries. The cousin's behavior escalated despite that, leading to the incident. \n\nI think the key points are: the author is trying to protect the dog, the cousin's autism affects his understanding, and communication might be a factor. The author's approach could be seen as firm but necessary for the dog's safety. However, maybe there's a lack of understanding of the cousin's needs. But the author didn't give an opportunity to the cousin to learn from the situation, perhaps. The author's response was to cut off visits instead of finding another solution. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions were proportionate. The cousin's actions were harmful, but the author's response was immediate and perhaps harsh. However, given the dog's age and sensitivity, the author's concern is valid. Maybe the author is not in the wrong, but there could be a better approach. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because protecting the dog's well-being is a valid reason, even if the communication could be improved.\n"
