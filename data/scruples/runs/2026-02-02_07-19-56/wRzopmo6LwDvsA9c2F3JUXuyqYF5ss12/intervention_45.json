This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. \n\nFirst, the context: The cousin is autistic, and there have been incidents where the cousin was with the dog. The first incident was the dog barking and then the cousin was just smiling. The second incident involved the cousin carrying the dog, which the dog didn't like, leading to the author raising their voice. Then the cousin had a tantrum and ran off. The author then decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt is upset, saying the author is rude and selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are the cousin's behavior and the author's response. The cousin is autistic, so maybe his actions are not fully within his control. The author is trying to protect the dog's well-being, especially since the dog is old and delicate. The cousin's actions, like chasing a laser, which can stress the dog, and carrying the dog when it's not comfortable, could be harmful. The author might have felt justified in protecting the dog. \n\nHowever, the author's approach to stopping the cousin from seeing the dog might be abrupt. Maybe they didn't consider alternative solutions, like setting up a safe way for the cousin to interact with the dog under supervision. Also, the cousin's autism might mean he doesn't understand the consequences of his actions or how to behave around animals. The author could have worked with the family to find a middle ground instead of an outright ban, especially since the family is upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's behavior was concerning. The dog was whimpering and then hit the ground hard when dropped. The author's responsibility to ensure the dog's safety is valid. But the way they handled it by completely stopping visits might have been too harsh, especially without discussing it with the family first.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's intention is to protect the dog, which is good, but the method might not consider the cousin's needs and the family's perspective. The author didn't provide alternatives, and the communication could have been better. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not finding a compromise. However, the main issue is the cousin's behavior towards the dog. \n\nHmm, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the cousin's actions genuinely endangered the dog, then the author is right to take action. But if the author's response was too severe without considering the cousin's condition, then they might be wrong. Since the cousin is autistic, the author should have considered accommodations. The author's decision to ban visits without prior discussion might have been too hasty, leading to conflict. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with more consideration for the cousin's needs and the family's input.\n"
