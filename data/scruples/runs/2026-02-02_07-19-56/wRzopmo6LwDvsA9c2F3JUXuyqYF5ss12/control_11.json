This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this scenario. The user is asking if the cousin is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The situation involves some conflict between family members.\n\nFirst, the cousin's actions: The cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which might not be safe for the dog. Then, the dog barked, which is a sign of distress. When the author found the dog whimpering and the cousin just sitting there smiling, that's concerning. The cousin's behavior escalated when he started running around with the dog in his arms, leading to the dog being dropped. The dog is old (13 years old), so handling it roughly is a problem. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, which led to a tantrum and the cousin running off.\n\nThe aunt's reaction was to call the author rude and selfish, mentioning the cousin's autism. The key here is understanding the balance between the cousin's needs and the dog's well-being. The cousin might not understand the dog's limitations due to his autism. However, the author is responsible for the dog's safety. The cousin's actions, like chasing a laser pen, picking up a dog that doesn't like being held, and then running with it, are risky and could harm the dog. The author is within their rights to set boundaries to protect the pet, especially when there's a history of concerning behavior. The author also tried to redirect the cousin with the PS4 offer, which shows they tried to manage the situation without confrontation.\n\nBut the author did raise their voice and threatened to stop visits, which might have been abrupt. However, the cousin's actions were harmful. The aunt's criticism seems to overlook the immediate welfare of the dog. The cousin's autism might mean he doesn't comprehend the consequences of his actions, but the author is responsible for the dog. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect the dog from potential harm, even if it means restricting visits. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
