This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog after some incidents.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The cousin is autistic, and there were two main incidents. The first time, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pointer, and then the dog started barking, which the author associates with aggression. When the author checked, the dog was whimpering, the cousin was just smiling. Then the cousin didn't respond when asked what happened. The second incident was the cousin waking up the sleeping dog, carrying him around which the dog doesn't like, leading the author to raise their voice and threaten to stop him from seeing the dog. The cousin had a tantrum, and then the aunt called the author rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism, which can affect how he processes information and behaves. Autistic individuals might have sensory sensitivities or different ways of interacting. The cousin might not understand social cues, like the dog not liking to be carried or the consequences of his actions. The author's actions were based on protecting the dog and their own comfort, but maybe they didn't consider the cousin's needs or his ability to understand the rules.\n\nThe author's decision to cut off the cousin seems harsh. The cousin's behavior might stem from not understanding boundaries, not malicious intent. The author could have handled it by setting clear, consistent boundaries with support, maybe involving the aunt to communicate better. The aunt's reaction suggests she feels the cousin wasn't given a chance to learn and adjust, which might be valid if the cousin is still learning.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is responsible for their dog's well-being. The dog is old and might be fragile. If the cousin's actions are risky, the author has a right to protect their pet. However, the approach of an immediate ban without teaching or consequences might be too abrupt. Maybe the author could have explored other solutions, like supervised visits or teaching the cousin how to interact with the dog safely.\n\nAutism can require more patience and tailored approaches. The cousin might need clear explanations and positive reinforcement instead of sudden removal of a privilege. The author might have acted out of frustration, which is understandable, but maybe not the most effective way considering the cousin's needs.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the cousin's needs and not providing a structured way for him to learn. The cousin's autism is a factor that needs consideration in how rules are set and enforced. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
