This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their autistic cousin to see their dog anymore. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The cousin is autistic. He was with the dog, and there were incidents where the dog ended up whimpering and then later being dropped after the cousin ran around with it. The author is worried about the dog's safety, especially since the dog is old (13 years). The cousin has an outburst, and when the author stops the behavior, the cousin's mom and aunt are upset, calling the author rude and selfish.\n\nNow, considering autism, people on the spectrum might react differently to situations. The cousin might not fully understand the consequences of his actions. The author is trying to protect the dog, which is a valid concern. However, the cousin's behavior suggests he might not grasp the dog's discomfort or the need for gentle handling.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are to prevent harm to the dog, which is reasonable. However, the way they handled the situation might come across as harsh, especially if there wasn't prior communication about the dog's needs. The cousin might not know that the dog doesn't like being picked up or that loud noises or running around could stress the dog. The author could have tried to educate the cousin first, maybe with visual aids or clear instructions tailored to his learning style.\n\nBut since the author did mention that the dog doesn't like being picked up and that it was explained multiple times, maybe the cousin still didn't understand. In that case, the author's decision to stop visits might be necessary for the dog's well-being. However, cutting off interaction entirely without trying other methods (like supervision or behavioral training) could be seen as abrupt.\n\nAlso, the cousin's autism is a factor here. The author might not have considered how the cousin processes information or handles sensory issues. The outburst could be a communication of distress rather than malice. The author's response, raising their voice and grabbing the cousin's arm, might have been traumatic for him.\n\nSo, balancing the dog's safety with the cousin's needs. The author's intentions are good, but the execution might be flawed. They might need to approach it with more empathy, possibly involving the family to find a middle ground. Therefore, maybe the author is partly in the wrong for not addressing the situation with more accommodations for the cousin's autism before cutting off visits. But ultimately, protecting the dog is important. It's a tough spot, but the answer hinges on whether the author considered the cousin's challenges and tried alternative solutions first.\n"
