This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin, a dog, and some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the story. The author moved out and has a dog that their mother, aunt, and cousin visit. The cousin is autistic, and the author is concerned about the cousin's behavior around the dog. There were instances where the cousin played with the dog using a laser pen, leading to the dog barking and then whimpering. Later, the cousin tried to carry the dog, which the dog dislikes, causing the dog to hit the floor when dropped. The author then decided to stop allowing the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his understanding of appropriate behavior around pets. The author is responsible for the dog's well-being. The cousin's actions (using a laser pen, carrying the dog forcefully) could be harmful. The author reacted by setting boundaries to protect the dog, which is understandable. However, the cousin's parents are upset, saying the author is being rude and selfish.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's primary responsibility is the dog's safety. The cousin's behavior was risky, and the author had to intervene. On the other hand, the cousin has autism, which might mean he needs more guidance or understanding. The author's approach might have been too harsh, especially since the cousin might not fully grasp the consequences of his actions. The author could have tried other methods, like more communication with the cousin's parents, or finding a way to involve the cousin in a guided, safe manner.\n\nAlso, the way the author reacted\u2014raising their voice and stopping the cousin from seeing the dog\u2014might be seen as abrupt. Maybe a more collaborative approach with the family, explaining the dog's needs and working together on acceptable interactions, would have been better. However, the immediate danger to the dog (like being dropped or forced) is a valid concern. The author's actions were to prevent harm to the dog, which is a priority.\n\nAutism can affect impulse control and understanding of social cues, so the cousin might not realize that his actions are problematic. The author could have provided clearer instructions or boundaries beforehand. However, when the cousin's actions are causing direct harm, the author has the right to set limits to protect their pet. The parents' reaction might be more about the cousin's needs and the author's perceived harshness rather than the actual safety issue.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are to protect the dog, the way they handled the situation could be improved by considering the cousin's needs and communicating better with the family. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author isn't necessarily wrong for protecting their dog, especially if the cousin's actions are harmful. However, the approach could be seen as too strict without proper communication. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer would be B (No), because the author's main goal is the dog's well-being, which is a valid reason to set boundaries.\n"
