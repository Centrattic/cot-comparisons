This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an autistic cousin, an old dog, and some conflict over how the cousin interacts with the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to read the details carefully. The cousin was allowed to see the dog, but there were incidents where the dog seemed scared, and the cousin had a tantrum when told no. The author decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog, leading to a call from the aunt accusing them of being rude and selfish.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's autism. Autism can affect how someone behaves, especially if they have sensory issues or struggle with understanding boundaries. The cousin might not grasp that the dog doesn't like being picked up or that loud noises or sudden movements are distressing. The author's actions\u2014like threatening to stop the cousin from seeing the dog\u2014might have been a reaction to the behavior, but maybe they didn't consider the cousin's needs or limitations.\n\nThe author's response could be seen as reasonable if the cousin's behavior was genuinely harmful. However, the cousin's autism might mean that he can't control his impulses, and the author might not have addressed the situation with the necessary accommodations or communication. For example, maybe the author could have talked to the aunt first about the behavior, provided clearer boundaries, or found alternative ways to manage the interactions instead of cutting off access abruptly.\n\nAlso, the author's tone in the interaction might have contributed to the conflict. Raising their voice and grabbing the cousin's arm could be perceived as harsh, especially if the cousin is sensitive to loud noises or physical restraint. The aunt's reaction might be partly due to the cousin being autistic and needing a different approach, which the author might not have considered.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's actions\u2014like running with the dog, causing it to hit the ground, and having a tantrum\u2014could be seen as harmful to the dog and disruptive. The author has a right to protect their pet, especially since the dog is elderly and fragile. The question is whether the author's response was proportionate and understanding given the cousin's condition.\n\nIn terms of the aunt's accusation, the author might have been abrupt without discussing with the family first. But the cousin's behavior does pose risks to the dog. It's a balance between managing the cousin's needs and the author's responsibility to their pet.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been more empathetic. They might need to work with the family to find a solution that accommodates the cousin's autism while ensuring the dog's safety. So maybe the answer is A or B depending on perspective. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the cousin's actions were harmful, the author's decision to set boundaries could be justified. But the method might have been too harsh without considering the autism aspect. Hmm.\n\nI think the correct answer is A because the author didn't account for the cousin's autism and didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity, leading to conflict. But I'm a bit torn because the cousin's behavior was problematic. However, given the autistic aspect, the author should have addressed it differently. So A.\n"
