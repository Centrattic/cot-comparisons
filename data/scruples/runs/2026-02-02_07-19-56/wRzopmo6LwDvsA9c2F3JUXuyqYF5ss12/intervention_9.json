This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their autistic cousin and the family dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was allowed to visit the dog. The first incident was the cousin chasing the dog with a laser pen, leading the dog to bark and then whimper. The cousin didn't respond when asked about it. Then the cousin started a tantrum about walking the dog, and when told no, he ran around with the dog in his arms, which resulted in the dog being dropped and running away. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt called the author rude and selfish because the cousin is autistic.\n\nThe key points here are the cousin's behavior towards the dog and the author's response. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his understanding of appropriate behavior. The author is concerned about the dog's safety, especially since the dog is old (13 years old) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions, like chasing the dog and carrying it, could be harmful. The author tried to set boundaries and even offered an alternative (playing PS4), but the cousin escalated the situation.\n\nHowever, the author's response included raising their voice and threatening to stop visits. The cousin then had a tantrum, which might be due to his autism making it hard to process the situation. The aunt's reaction is based on the cousin's needs and the challenge of managing his behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting the dog and setting boundaries, which is necessary for the dog's safety. On the other hand, the author's response might have been harsh, especially considering the cousin's autism. Maybe there could have been a more understanding approach, like explaining the dog's needs more clearly or involving the parents in setting rules that accommodate the cousin's behavior.\n\nBut the cousin's actions were clearly harmful to the dog. The author had a right to enforce rules to prevent harm. The threat to stop visits was a consequence for the cousin's behavior, which the author found unacceptable. However, the way it was handled\u2014raising their voice and the cousin's subsequent tantrum\u2014might have been a result of the communication style. The aunt's reaction seems to stem from feeling the author is being too strict without considering autism-related challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are to protect the dog, their approach might not have been the most effective considering the cousin's condition. However, the cousin's actions were inappropriate and could have been dangerous for the dog. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but there's room for a more compassionate approach tailored to the cousin's needs. The answer is B (Not in the wrong), but with the nuance that the situation requires careful handling.\n"
