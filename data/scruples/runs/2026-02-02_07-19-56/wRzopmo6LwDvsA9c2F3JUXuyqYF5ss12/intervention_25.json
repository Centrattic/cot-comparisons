This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. The situation involves some specific incidents where the cousin's behavior caused concern.\n\nFirst, the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which might not be safe. Then, the dog was whimpering and the cousin didn't respond to the author's questions. Later, the cousin insisted on walking the dog alone, leading to the dog being carried while asleep and then being dropped. The author raised their voice and threatened to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The aunt then accused the author of being rude and selfish.\n\nThe cousin is autistic, which is mentioned as part of the context. Autism can affect how someone processes situations, social interactions, and sensory stimuli. The cousin's actions might not have been intentional but could be due to his challenges in understanding boundaries or coping with stress.\n\nThe author's main concern is the dog's well-being and the cousin's safety. However, the cousin's behavior did lead to situations that could be harmful. The author's response was to set a boundary to prevent further incidents. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nFrom one angle, the author has the right to protect their dog, especially since the cousin's actions led to the dog being hurt. They also have the right to set boundaries in their home. On the other hand, given the cousin's autism, perhaps a more understanding or accommodating approach could have been taken, like explaining the dog's needs more carefully or finding alternative ways to manage the interactions.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be influenced by a lack of understanding about the author's perspective. The author might not have considered the cousin's autism when reacting, leading to a conflict. However, the cousin's actions were indeed problematic, and the author's threat to stop visits is a way to enforce safety.\n\nIn such cases, balancing the needs of the autistic individual with the well-being of the pet is crucial. The author might need to involve the family in finding a solution that respects both the cousin's needs and the dog's safety, perhaps with clearer communication and structured activities. But based on the incidents described, the author's actions seem justified in protecting the dog. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
