This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the cousin is autistic. The author mentions that the cousin has had some incidents where he was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which led the dog to bark. Then later, the cousin was running around with the dog in his arms while the dog was asleep, which the author found upsetting because the dog is old and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin had a tantrum, dropped the dog, and ran away. The author then told the cousin he can't see the dog anymore, leading to a conflict with the aunt.\n\nNow, considering the cousin's autism, it's possible that his behavior stems from sensory issues or difficulty understanding social cues. Autistic individuals might have different ways of interacting with animals or handling stress. The cousin might not realize that picking up the dog is harmful or that his actions are causing distress. The author's reactions\u2014raising their voice, grabbing the cousin's arm\u2014could be seen as a response to immediate concern for the dog's safety, but they might not have considered the cousin's needs or communication style.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is responsible for the dog's well-being. An old dog that's stressed or injured is a valid concern. The cousin's behavior did lead to the dog being dropped, which is dangerous. The author's decision to stop interactions might be necessary to prevent harm to the dog. However, the approach taken (threatening to stop visits, using physical restraint) might not be the most effective or compassionate way, especially given the cousin's autism. The author might need accommodations or a better communication strategy rather than an outright ban.\n\nThe aunt's reaction could also be influenced by not fully understanding the author's perspective on the dog's safety versus the cousin's needs. The author might need to find a middle ground, maybe setting up rules for interactions, providing supervision, or using positive reinforcement to teach appropriate behavior without cutting off the cousin entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about the dog's safety, the way they handled the situation might not be the most considerate towards the cousin's autism. It's a balance between protecting the pet and supporting the cousin's needs. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, given the options, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong) because they are justified in protecting their dog, even if their method could be better.\n"
