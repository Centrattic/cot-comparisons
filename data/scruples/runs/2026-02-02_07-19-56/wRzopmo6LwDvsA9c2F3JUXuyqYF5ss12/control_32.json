This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an autistic cousin and the author's dog. The cousin was allowed to visit the dog, but during one visit, the dog was whimpering and later had an incident where the cousin was carrying it roughly, leading the author to threaten to stop visits. Now the aunt is upset, saying the author was rude and selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The cousin is autistic, so maybe his behavior is a result of that condition. The author mentions the dog is old (13 years) and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin was insistent and had a tantrum, leading to the dog being dropped. The author raised their voice and said they might stop the visits. The aunt is upset, blaming the author.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were concerned about the dog's well-being. The dog was showing distress during the play with the cousin, and later being carried while asleep could be harmful. The cousin's behavior seems problematic\u2014chasing a laser, then carrying the dog roughly, leading to a tantrum. The author had to intervene to stop him from running to their room, which sounds like a safety issue.\n\nHowever, the cousin is autistic, so his actions might not be intentional. Maybe he didn't realize the dog's discomfort or the danger of carrying it. The author allowed visits initially but had to set boundaries. The cousin's mother was present when the first incident happened, and she might have known about the dog's needs. The second incident occurred when the cousin was left alone, perhaps without proper supervision.\n\nThe author's reaction might be seen as necessary to protect the dog. But maybe they could have handled it differently, like speaking to the parents first or not raising their voice. However, in the moment, the author felt the need to act to prevent harm. The aunt's response of calling them rude and selfish seems harsh, especially if the cousin's actions were indeed harmful. The key points are the dog's well-being and the cousin's challenging behavior. The author isn't the one in the wrong if they were protecting their pet from mistreatment. But if the cousin's actions were a result of his autism and not malice, the author should be considerate. However, given the dog's age and the specific incidents described, the author's actions seem justified. So the answer is B.\n"
