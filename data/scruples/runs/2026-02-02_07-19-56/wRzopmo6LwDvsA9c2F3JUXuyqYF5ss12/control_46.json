This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their autistic cousin was allowed to visit and see their dog. The cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, which might not be safe. Then the dog started barking, indicating something was wrong. The cousin was unresponsive when asked what happened, and later, when given a chance to walk the dog, he ended up throwing the dog from his arms, causing it to hit the floor. The author then decided to stop the cousin from seeing the dog anymore, leading to conflict with the aunt.\n\nFirst, the author is responsible for the dog's well-being. The dog is 13 years old and doesn't like being picked up. The cousin's actions led to the dog being dropped, which could hurt the dog. The author's reaction is to prevent further harm, which seems reasonable. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his understanding of appropriate behavior. However, the author's responsibility includes ensuring the dog's safety, even if the cousin isn't aware of his actions.\n\nThe aunt and cousin might feel that the cousin was unfairly treated, but the author's actions were to protect the dog. The cousin's behavior was escalating, and the author tried to redirect him with the PS4 offer. When that failed, the author took a firm stand. The cousin's tantrum and the dog being dropped justify the author's decision to stop visits. The aunt's reaction might be based on not seeing the incident or misunderstanding the dog's needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they prioritized the dog's safety over the cousin's wants, especially given the cousin's behavior.\n"
