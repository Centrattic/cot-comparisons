This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves an autistic cousin and a dog.\n\nFirst, the cousin was with the dog using a laser pen. The dog started barking, which is unusual. The cousin was on the floor smiling, and the dog was whimpering. Then the cousin tried to walk the dog but got insistent when told no. He ended up carrying the dog, who was old and didn't like being picked up, leading to the author raising their voice and threatening to stop the cousin from seeing the dog. The cousin had a tantrum, and the author had to physically stop him. The aunt is upset, saying the author was out of order because the cousin is autistic.\n\nSo, the author is defending their dog from potentially harmful behavior. The cousin has autism, which might affect his understanding of boundaries. But the author is also responsible for the dog's well-being. The cousin's actions, like carrying an old dog who doesn't like it, could be dangerous. The author's reaction might be seen as necessary to protect the dog, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, the cousin's behavior was escalating, and the author had to set boundaries. The aunt's reaction might be overblown, but the author's approach might not be entirely wrong. It's a balance between the cousin's needs and the dog's safety. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe could have communicated better. So the answer is B.\n"
