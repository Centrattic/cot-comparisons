This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation with their autistic cousin and the dog. So first, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly.\n\nThe author moved into a new apartment with their dog. They allowed their mom, aunt, and cousin to visit. The cousin is autistic. The key events are: the cousin was playing with the dog using a laser pen, the dog started barking and whimpering, the cousin didn't respond when asked, then later the cousin insisted on walking the dog, got insistent, had a tantrum, ran around with the dog in his arms, which the dog doesn't like, especially since the dog is old. The author raised their voice and told them they might not allow the cousin to see the dog anymore. The cousin had a tantrum, the author had to stop them from going to the room. Then the aunt called the author rude and selfish, saying the cousin doesn't understand because he's autistic.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cousin's autism. Autistic individuals can have different ways of interacting with the world, including sensory sensitivities. The cousin might not understand the dog's discomfort or the appropriateness of certain actions. However, the author is the one responsible for the dog's well-being. The cousin's actions (using a laser pen, which can be stressful for dogs, then picking up an old dog that doesn't like being held) could be harmful. \n\nThe author had to manage the situation by setting boundaries. But perhaps the author could have handled it differently, like explaining more clearly to the cousin why certain actions were wrong, or finding a way to facilitate interaction without stressing the dog. But the cousin was being insistent and had a tantrum, which might be challenging for the author to handle, especially if the cousin isn't receptive to reasoning at that moment.\n\nThe aunt's reaction seems to be that the author was too harsh. But the author was protecting the dog's safety and well-being. The cousin's behavior was escalating, and the author was trying to prevent further incidents. \n\nIn these situations, it's about balancing the needs of the cousin (due to autism) with the responsibility to the pet. The author might not be in the wrong because they had the right to protect their dog. However, the way they handled it (raising their voice, threatening to stop all visits) could be seen as harsh. But given the cousin's behavior and the potential harm, the author might have reasonable grounds for their actions.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to protect their dog from potentially harmful situations, even if their communication could have been improved. The key is that the author's actions were necessary for the dog's safety, even if the cousin's autism complicates the interaction.\n"
