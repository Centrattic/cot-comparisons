This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their autistic cousin from seeing their dog. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe cousin has been visiting and had incidents where the dog started whimpering during play with a laser pen, then later the cousin tried to carry the dog when it was asleep, leading to the dog hitting the floor. The author tried to set boundaries but the cousin had a tantrum. The aunt is upset, saying the cousin is autistic and not understanding. The author now wants to stop visits.\n\nFirst, consider the cousin's behavior. The cousin is autistic, which might affect his understanding of appropriate behavior towards the dog. The incidents described\u2014like chasing a laser pen, picking up the dog when it didn't want to be picked up\u2014could be due to not grasping the dog's signals. The author might be overreacting if the cousin isn't doing it on purpose, but the dog's safety is a concern. The dog is 13 years old, so its health and stress are important.\n\nThe author tried to set boundaries and offered alternatives like playing PS4. When the cousin pushed limits, the author raised their voice. The cousin then had a tantrum and ran off, leading to the dog being dropped. The aunt called the author rude and selfish. \n\nAutism can mean the cousin doesn't understand consequences or social cues. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to protect the dog from harm, but perhaps could have communicated better, maybe with the parents first to set clearer expectations. However, the cousin's actions did cause stress to the dog, so the author isn't entirely wrong in wanting to prevent further harm. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it with more patience, considering the cousin's needs, like providing structured activities or clearer instructions. However, the line between protecting the dog and respecting the cousin's boundaries is tricky. The author's response to the tantrum might have been harsh, but the underlying reason (dog's safety) is valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance. The author's intent was to protect the dog, which is understandable. However, not fully considering the cousin's autism in communication might have led to a conflict. Maybe the author should have discussed strategies with the family beforehand. Still, the outcome (dog being hurt) is a valid concern. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author is justified in protecting their dog, especially an elderly one, from potentially harmful behavior. But they might have handled it differently. However, the key is the author's right to set boundaries for their pet's safety. So, B.\n"
