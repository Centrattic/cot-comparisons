I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating (ghosted) a guy because of his social media posts. The guy keeps trying to contact them, and the author is defending their decision by citing the guy's immature content.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as a negative action because it involves cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. However, people might justify it for various reasons, especially if they find the other person's behavior off-putting. \n\nThe guy in question posted memes that the author finds immature and inappropriate. Memes about \"running away from hoes\" and \"friendzoned\" with a comment about wanting to sleep with a friend's bestie could be seen as immature or having a poor attitude towards relationships. The author is 23, which is an age where people are still forming their views, but they might be justified in their discomfort with such posts.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the guy's content is off-putting, ghosting could be seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The author didn't explain their reasons, so the guy is left trying to figure out what went wrong. However, if the content is a deal-breaker for the author, they might feel it's better to cut off communication rather than engage in something they find offensive.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions were justified given their reasons. If someone's social media posts are a red flag for the author, then they have a right to disengage. But the method of disengagement (ghosting) is where the debate lies. Some might argue that a direct message explaining the issue would be better, while others might agree that if the content is a major turn-off, ghosting is a way to avoid further interaction.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's action is a response to content they find unacceptable. While ghosting is generally frowned upon, their reasoning could be seen as valid. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
