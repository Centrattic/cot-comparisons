I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts was in the wrong. The scenario is that the author stopped communicating with a guy they were talking to because of some memes he posted. The memes in question are about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and hooking up with a friend's bestie. The author finds this immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Ghosting is when you cut off communication suddenly without explanation. The author didn't tell the guy why they stopped talking. The guy is trying to reach out again. The author's reason is the guy's social media content. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, people have different boundaries. If the author found the guy's posts to be inappropriate or not aligned with their values, that's their personal choice. However, ghosting without explanation can be hurtful. The guy might not know he did something to offend. \n\nBut, social media is public. The author made their decision based on content the guy chose to post, which reflects his personality. The author isn't in a relationship, just talking to someone, so maybe they had the right to disengage if they felt uncomfortable. However, not providing a reason could leave the other person confused. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was justified. The guy's posts could be seen as disrespectful, so the author's discomfort is valid. But ghosting without explanation can be seen as abrupt. However, it's not necessarily wrong if the author felt the content was a deal-breaker. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't doing anything harmful beyond cutting off contact. The guy is the one trying to keep the conversation going. The author's reasoning is based on personal values, which is okay. So maybe the answer is B (No) because the author isn't the asshole for disengaging from someone whose behavior they find off-putting, even if ghosting isn't the best approach.\n"
