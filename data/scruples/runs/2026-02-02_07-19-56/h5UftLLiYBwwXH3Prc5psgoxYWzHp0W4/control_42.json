I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy they were talking to, without explaining why. The guy is trying to contact them and wants to go out. The author's reason is that the guy's social media posts are immature and gross, like a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice\" girlfriend, and another post about getting friend-zoned and then hitting on friends' besties. The author considers this immature and a turn-off, so they ghosted him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's actions are justified. Ghosting is generally considered poor communication, but the context matters. The author didn't give a reason, which can be hurtful. However, the content of the guy's posts does seem problematic. The memes reference disrespectful attitudes towards women, which are indeed red flags. The author is within their right to not want to engage with someone who holds such views. But the issue is whether ghosting was the right approach. While the content is off-putting, cutting off communication without explanation can leave the other person confused. However, the author might feel that explaining would involve having to address something they found offensive and maybe not worth the conversation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are the content of the guy's posts and the author's right to set boundaries. The guy's social media content reflects a disrespectful and immature attitude towards relationships and women. The author's decision to disengage is a personal choice based on their values. While ghosting isn't ideal in terms of communication, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are protecting their own comfort and standards. The guy's behavior through his social media is the real issue here. The author isn't obligated to explain their decisions to someone they find incompatible. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
