I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is about social media posts that the author found immature and annoying. The guy posted memes about wanting a faithful girlfriend but then also talked about the friendzone and helping to sleep with someone else's bestie. The author stopped talking to him without explaining and now he's trying to contact them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if ghosting is ever acceptable. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. In some cases, people do it to avoid confrontation or if they feel the other person isn't compatible. The author's reasoning is that the guy's social media posts are immature and a turn-off. \n\nNow, the key points here: the author found the content offensive, so they decided to ghost. The guy is trying to reach out again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting him. \n\nI think the author's right to set boundaries. If someone's public posts make you feel uncomfortable or not aligned with your values, it's reasonable to distance yourself. However, ghosting without any explanation can be hurtful. The guy might not understand why he was cut off, especially since social media posts are public and the author didn't address it directly. \n\nBut considering the content, the guy might have a problematic attitude towards relationships, which could be a red flag. The author is in their right to not want to engage with someone who promotes such views. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The alternative is that the author should have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting. But if the author felt the guy wouldn't take it seriously, maybe ghosting was a way to avoid conflict. \n\nHmm, but is it fair to judge someone solely on their social media? The guy might not be aware that his posts are offensive, or maybe he's just posting for humor. The author's response is a personal choice, but could there be a better way to handle it? Maybe, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to disengage if the person's behavior is off-putting. However, some might argue that ghosting is rude, but the reasoning here is valid. So the answer should be B.\n"
