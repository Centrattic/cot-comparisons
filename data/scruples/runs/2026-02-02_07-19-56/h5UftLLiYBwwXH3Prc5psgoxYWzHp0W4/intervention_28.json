I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with someone because of his social media posts, which they found immature and off-putting. The guy in question posted memes about wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend\" and another about the \"friendzone\" and helping him with friends' besties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around communication and boundaries. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person hanging without explanation. But there are reasons people might do it, like feeling uncomfortable or disapproving of someone's values.\n\nThe author mentions that the guy's posts are immature. At 23, they might be looking for someone more mature. If the author felt that the guy's behavior or attitudes were incompatible with their own values, maybe ghosting isn't entirely unreasonable. However, cutting off communication without any explanation can be harsh. The guy tried to contact them after being ghosted, so the author didn't even give him a chance to address the issue.\n\nBut wait, the posts themselves\u2014like the meme about \"running away from hoes\" and the other one about the friendzone\u2014could be seen as objectifying women or having a disrespectful attitude towards relationships. If the author values mutual respect and seriousness, then maybe they're justified in cutting things off. However, the way they did it (ghosting) is the main issue here. It's about how you handle the situation, not just the reason. \n\nSome might argue that if the guy's behavior is a deal-breaker, then it's okay to end things, but the lack of communication is still a problem. Others might say that the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their own standards and well-being. \n\nI think the key points are: the content of his posts being a valid reason for the author to disengage, and the method of ghosting. If the author had communicated their reasons, it would have been more respectful. But since they didn't, even if the reason is valid, the approach is questionable. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for ghosting without explanation, even if the reason is about his posts. But if the posts are a deal-breaker, maybe not. Hmm, tricky.\n"
