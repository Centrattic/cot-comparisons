I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The context is that the author stopped talking to a guy because of his social media posts, which included a meme about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another post that mentions getting help from someone who friendzones him to sleep with their friend's bestie. The author thinks these posts are immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, the author has a specific reason here. The social media content in question includes things that might be considered disrespectful towards women. The author found these posts gross and immature and decided to stop interacting.\n\nNow, should the author have explained why they ghosted? Ghosting without any explanation can be seen as inconsiderate, but if the reasons are about personal boundaries and values, it's a bit more nuanced. The author is 23, which is an age where people are developing their social and romantic standards. If the guy's posts reflect a mindset that the author finds incompatible with their values, then choosing not to engage further isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nBut is the act of ghosting itself wrong? Some people argue that even if you don't want to continue a relationship, honesty and communication are important. However, if the author felt that engaging further would be uncomfortable or that the guy's behavior was inappropriate, then ghosting might be a way to protect their own well-being. \n\nThe key here is the content of the guy's posts. If they're promoting objectification or disrespectful attitudes, then the author has a valid reason to distance themselves. However, if the author didn't address it directly, it's a bit of a conflict between personal boundaries and communication ethics.\n\nIn many cases, people use social media to express themselves, and unless the content is directly targeting someone or causing harassment, it's a matter of personal taste. But if the author found the posts to be a deal-breaker, then their decision is about their own comfort and values. \n\nSo, while ghosting is typically frowned upon, the reason here might justify it. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to engage with someone whose views they find offensive. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
