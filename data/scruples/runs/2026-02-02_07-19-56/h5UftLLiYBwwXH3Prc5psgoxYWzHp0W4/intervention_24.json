I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The person stopped talking to a guy because of his social media posts, which they found immature and inappropriate. The author is unsure if they were right to ghost him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. The posts in question are about running away from women and friendzoning, which the author finds gross and immature. The key point here is whether the content is offensive or a personal preference. If someone's social media presence makes you uncomfortable, it's reasonable to distance yourself. However, ghosting without explanation can be seen as rude.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is based on personal boundaries and finding the content unappealing. On the other hand, ghosting without communication can leave the other person confused and hurt. But social media posts are public, so the author had a valid reason to disengage.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't doing something illegal or unethical; they're setting personal boundaries. While the method of communication (ghosting) could be improved, the decision to distance oneself isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
