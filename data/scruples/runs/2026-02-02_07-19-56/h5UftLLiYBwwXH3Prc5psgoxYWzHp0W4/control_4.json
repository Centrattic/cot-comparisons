I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explaining why, and they mention the guy's social media posts as the reason. The posts include a meme about wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend\" and another about friendzoning leading to hooking up with someone's friend's bestie. The author found these posts immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of ghosting. Ghosting is when someone suddenly stops all communication without explanation. It's generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the reason for ghosting can affect how people perceive the situation. \n\nIn this case, the author's reason is the guy's social media content. The posts they mention seem to reflect certain attitudes about relationships and sexuality. The author finds them immature and inappropriate for someone their age (23). They argue that people who act this way should be avoided. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is justified in their actions. If the content is offensive or goes against the author's values, they might feel it's a deal-breaker. However, the issue is the method of ending the interaction. Ghosting is typically frowned upon because it's inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid. \n\nSome might argue that the author is justified in setting boundaries and avoiding someone whose views clash with theirs. Others might say that even if the content is problematic, ghosting isn't the right approach; a direct conversation would be better. \n\nThe challenge here is balancing respect for personal boundaries with the impact of ghosting. The author's actions might be seen as self-preservation, but the lack of communication could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI need to check if the author's reasoning is valid. The posts do seem to express a certain attitude about relationships that could be off-putting. However, the decision to ghost might still be seen as wrong because of the abruptness. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised to communicate issues directly rather than cutting off contact without explanation. But if the person feels that engaging further is not worth their emotional well-being, some might side with them. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether the method of ending contact (ghosting) is as important as the reason. If the reason is valid, some might excuse the ghosting. However, the consensus often leans towards not ghosting, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because ghosting is generally discouraged, even if the reason is understandable. Alternatively, if the content is truly unacceptable, the answer could be no (B), as they have the right to disengage from toxic behavior.\n"
