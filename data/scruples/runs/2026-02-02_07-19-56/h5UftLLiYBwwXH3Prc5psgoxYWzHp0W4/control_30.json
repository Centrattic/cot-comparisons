I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted is in the wrong. So, the scenario is someone stops talking to a guy without explaining, and the reason given is his social media posts. The posts in question are about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and sleeping with someone's friend's bestie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person without closure. But the user argues that the guy's social media content is immature and off-putting. The user is 23, so maybe they feel that such posts indicate immaturity or bad character, which is a legitimate concern for someone looking for a serious relationship.\n\nNow, is the user justified in their actions? On one hand, ghosting is abrupt and can be hurtful. The guy is trying to contact them and get them to go out, implying he's interested. Cutting off communication without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the person's social media posts are a deal-breaker for the user, then maybe it's their right to disengage. The user might feel that the guy's values or maturity level are incompatible.\n\nBut the key here is whether the user is in the wrong. The question is about their actions. Ghosting is typically frowned upon because it's disrespectful. However, if the user felt that the guy's posts were a major red flag, they might believe they're better off ending contact. The user is asking if they're an asshole for doing this. \n\nI should also consider cultural context. Social media posts can reflect someone's personality, but interpreting them correctly matters. The memes might be taken literally as signs of immaturity or disrespect towards women, which the user finds unacceptable. If the user is looking for someone more mature, it's reasonable to disengage. However, the method of ghosting is problematic regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. The user might have a valid reason for cutting contact but handled it poorly. The question is whether they're in the wrong. If the answer is about the action (ghosting) versus the reason (valid or not), the ghosting itself is inconsiderate, but the reason might justify it. However, in terms of being an asshole, if the reason is valid, maybe they're not the asshole. But the act of ghosting is still wrong, hence maybe the author is an asshole for that. Hmm.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the person's actions were ghosting without explanation, that's the issue. The reason might be valid, but the method of cutting contact is the problem. However, the user might argue that the reason is sufficient. So, the answer would depend on weighing the reason against the method. Since ghosting is generally seen as wrong, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if the reason excuses it. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B (No), because the reason is valid enough. \n\nI think in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) framework, the focus is on both intent and action. The user's intent is to avoid someone they find immature and inappropriate, which is understandable. However, the action of ghosting is considered rude. In AITA scenarios, people are often called out for their behavior even if their reasoning is valid. So, the user is in the wrong because of ghosting, despite the reason. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
