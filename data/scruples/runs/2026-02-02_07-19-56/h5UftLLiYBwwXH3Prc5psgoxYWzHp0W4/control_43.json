I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explaining, and the reason given is the guy's social media posts which the author found immature and off-putting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused without explanation. But there are nuances. The author mentions the guy's posts about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another post about friendzoning and then messing with the friend's bestie. The author finds these posts immature and gross, indicating they don't want to engage with someone who has such attitudes.\n\nIs it valid for the author to ghost based on those posts? Well, if the author found those values or attitudes incompatible with their own, it's understandable they want no further contact. However, ghosting without any explanation can be hurtful. The question is whether the author's actions are justified given the content of the posts.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual respect in communication. If the guy's posts reflect behaviors or attitudes that the author finds unacceptable, then ending the interaction might be reasonable. But ghosting is abrupt. A better approach would be to explain the reason for disengaging, even if it's brief. However, the author might not want to engage further, so maybe they felt ghosting was the only way to avoid continued contact.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's decision is based on personal boundaries and values, then they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, the method of ending contact (ghosting) is where the judgment might lie. But since the user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA), the community often considers the reasons behind the action. If the reason is valid (immaturity, inappropriate content), then the author might not be the asshole, even if the method isn't ideal. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason to disengage based on incompatible values, even if the method could be improved.\n"
