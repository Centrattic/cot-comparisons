I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of their social media posts. The author mentions the guy posted memes that the author finds immature and off-putting. They ghosted him without explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is based on the guy's posts, which they find inappropriate for someone their age. They might feel that such content shows immaturity or disrespect towards women, which is a valid personal preference. However, ghosting without any communication can be seen as hurtful. The guy is trying to reach out, and the author isn't giving him a chance to explain or change.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries based on their values. If the posts genuinely make them uncomfortable, it's reasonable to distance themselves. But the method of ghosting might be the issue here. Instead of cutting off communication abruptly, maybe a more direct approach would have been better. The key points are the validity of the author's feelings and the appropriateness of their response.\n\nI need to decide if the author's actions were wrong. The answer depends on whether ghosting is an acceptable response to someone's social media behavior. Some might argue that the author is justified in ending the interaction if they find the posts offensive. Others might say that ghosting is rude regardless of the reason. However, since the author has the right to their preferences, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the lack of communication could be seen as inconsiderate. Hmm. I think the answer might be B, not in the wrong, because the author has the right to their boundaries, even if the method is harsh.\n"
