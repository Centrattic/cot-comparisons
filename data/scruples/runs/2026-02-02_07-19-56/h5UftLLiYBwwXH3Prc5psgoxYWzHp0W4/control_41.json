I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're an a**hole for ghosting someone because of their social media posts. So, the person ghosted a guy without explaining why, and the guy is trying to contact them again. The reason given is that the guy's social media posts are immature, like the meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another post about the friendzone and sleeping with someone's friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds this gross and immature.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of ghosting. Ghosting is when someone suddenly stops all communication without any explanation. It can be hurtful because the person left in the dark doesn't know what they did wrong. But sometimes people ghost because they feel uncomfortable or don't want to engage further. The key here is the reason for ghosting. If the content of the guy's social media is offensive or makes the author uncomfortable, maybe they have a right to disengage. \n\nThe guy's posts are about wanting a faithful girlfriend but also have elements that could be seen as objectifying women or being disrespectful. The author is put off by this immaturity. But the question is whether ghosting without explanation is acceptable in this case. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries and not engage with content that they find offensive. On the other hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused. However, if the content is a deal-breaker for the author, maybe it's not entirely their fault. \n\nBut maybe the author could have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting. However, sometimes people don't want to engage further, especially if they feel the person isn't someone they can be with. The posts might indicate a lack of respect for women, which is a valid concern. The author's reaction is based on the guy's public behavior, which he's aware of. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the posts are a legitimate reason to disengage, then maybe not. The problem is ghosting without explanation, but if the content is a red flag, then the author's action is understandable. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting on their own boundaries and discomfort with the guy's posts. However, some might argue that ghosting is still rude regardless of the reason. But given the context, it's a valid reason for the author to disengage.\n"
