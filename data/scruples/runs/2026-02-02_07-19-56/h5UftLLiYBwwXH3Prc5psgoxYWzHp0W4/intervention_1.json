I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to someone without explanation, mainly because of his social media posts which the author finds immature and offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The guy posted memes that use derogatory terms like \"hoes\" and has a friendzone meme. The author is 23 and finds these posts gross and immature. They ghosted him, and now he's trying to contact them again.\n\nGhosting without explanation can be rude, but the author had a reason. Social media content is part of someone's public personality. If someone's posts are offensive to you, it's reasonable to want to disengage. However, ghosting is abrupt. The right approach might have been to explain why the communication was ending, but the author didn't do that.\n\nBut then, is the author in the wrong? The key points are whether the content was a valid reason to stop communication and if ghosting was the appropriate method. The content seems to use terms that are disrespectful, which could be a legitimate reason to distance oneself. However, ghosting doesn't allow for clarity. \n\nThe question is about moral wrongness. If the author felt that the content was offensive and a dealbreaker, then ending communication isn't wrong. But the method (ghosting) might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the alternative is to explain, which the author didn't. So, is it the author's fault for ghosting, or is it the other person's fault for being offensive?\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. The answer depends on whether the reason is justified. Since the other person's posts are offensive, the author's reaction might be justified. But the act of ghosting is still considered rude, regardless of the reason. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong for not communicating clearly, but the main issue is the other person's content. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author had a valid reason, maybe they aren't. But ghosting is generally frowned upon. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had a legitimate reason to disengage. The problem is the method, but the decision to stop contact isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer could be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they had a reason, even if the method could have been better.\n"
