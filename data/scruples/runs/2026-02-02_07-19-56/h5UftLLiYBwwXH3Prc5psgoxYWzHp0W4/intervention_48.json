I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone for their social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy they were talking to because of his social media content. The guy they ghosted keeps trying to contact them.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the guy's posts are immature and off-putting. The posts mentioned are about running away from hoes and friendzoning. The author is 23 and finds this gross and a turn-off. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm, in terms of ghosting, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author didn't give a reason for cutting off communication, which can be hurtful. The guy is trying to reach out, which might be confusing for him. But on the other hand, the author had a valid reason based on the guy's social media content. If the author found his posts to be disrespectful or immature, maybe they felt it was a deal-breaker before any relationship could develop.\n\nGhosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and doesn't allow the other person to respond or understand. However, if the author felt that the guy's behavior was incompatible with their values, maybe they had a right to step back. The key here is whether the author had a genuine reason and whether ghosting was the best approach.\n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. They had a reason, even if they didn't communicate it. However, the act of ghosting without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. But given the content of the posts, maybe the author felt it was necessary for their own well-being. So, the answer might depend on the balance between respecting the other person's feelings and standing by one's own boundaries.\n"
