I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The person ghosted a guy after seeing his posts, which include things like a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another post about the friendzone and sleeping with a friend's bestie. The author feels that these posts are immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you don't give an explanation. But in this case, the person has a reason. The question is whether the reason justifies ghosting. The guy's posts might be considered immature or inappropriate, especially for someone looking for a serious relationship. The author might feel that these posts indicate a lack of maturity or problematic behavior, which is a valid reason to disengage.\n\nOn the other hand, social media posts can be taken out of context. Maybe the guy was joking or it's part of his personality. The author didn't address the issue directly, which could have been a better approach. However, if the posts genuinely bother the author and are a deal-breaker, then it's their right to discontinue the interaction. \n\nThe key points are: the reason for ghosting, the appropriateness of the reason, and whether there's a better way to handle it. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but considering the content of the posts, maybe not. The author is within their rights to avoid someone whose values or behavior they find unacceptable. Ghosting isn't great communication, but the intent here is to avoid a potentially problematic situation. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
