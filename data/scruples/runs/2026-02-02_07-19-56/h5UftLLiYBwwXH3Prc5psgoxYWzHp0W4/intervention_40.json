I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy because of the stuff he posted on social media. The guy is trying to contact them, but the author just ghosted without explaining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. The author says the guy's posts are immature and gross, like memes about \"running away from hoes\" and another about the \"friendzone\" and sleeping with a friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds this stuff unappealing.\n\nNow, the question is whether ghosting without explanation is the wrong move. On one hand, the author has the right to disengage if they find someone's behavior or posts offensive. It's their choice who they want to interact with. On the other hand, ghosting without any communication can be hurtful and disrespectful. The guy might be left confused and not understanding why the connection was cut off.\n\nBut the key here is that the author felt the guy's behavior was inappropriate. They might not be the asshole if they genuinely found his posts to be a turn-off and decided to distance themselves. However, not giving any explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. But is that wrong? If someone's behavior is a red flag, it's reasonable to step back, even if it's abrupt.\n\nAlso, considering the guy's age: both are 23. The author's judgment about his maturity level might be valid. But ghosting without a reason can leave the other person in the dark, which isn't the kindest approach, but maybe not necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense. The author isn't necessarily the asshole here because they have the right to set boundaries. However, the act of ghosting without explaining might be seen as a bit harsh, but the underlying reason could justify it.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to stop the interaction, especially if the content was offensive. The wrong might lie more with the guy for posting such things. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
