I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explanation because of his social media posts. The guy is trying to contact them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given for ghosting. The author found the guy's social media content immature and off-putting. The posts mentioned include a meme about running away from \"hoes\" to find a \"nice, faithful girlfriend\" and a picture about the friendzone with a sexual twist. The author is 23 and finds this behavior gross and unbecoming for someone their age.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. However, people have the right to set boundaries and choose who they engage with. The guy's posts might be considered inappropriate or not aligned with the author's values. The key here is whether the author had a valid reason to end the interaction, which they do based on the content they disagree with. The author isn't in a relationship, just talking to someone, so maybe the expectation of communication is different.\n\nBut then, even if the posts are immature, the author could have explained their feelings instead of ghosting. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they had a reason to disengage and it's their choice to communicate with whom they want, maybe it's not their fault. The issue is more about the appropriateness of the guy's content rather than the author's ghosting.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because they have the right to distance themselves from content they find distasteful. However, the ghosting aspect is questionable, but the user's question is whether the author is wrong. Since the reason for ghosting is justified in their eyes, maybe they aren't wrong. Alternatively, if the posts are just opinions, the author might be overreacting. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the assistant might disagree.\n"
