Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting a guy because of his social media posts. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author stopped communicating with someone without explaining why, which is ghosting. The reason given is that the guy's social media posts are immature and gross, like a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another picture saying something about friendzoning and sleeping with someone's friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds these posts unappealing and signs of immaturity.\n\nNow, I have to evaluate if the author is wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, people might have reasons to end communication if they find someone's behavior or values incompatible. The key points here are the content of the guy's posts and the author's reaction.\n\nThe guy's posts do seem to express certain attitudes towards relationships and women. The author finds these attitudes off-putting and a sign of immaturity. From the author's perspective, ending contact is justified because they don't want to be with someone who is immature and has such views. \n\nBut is it fair to ghost someone for their social media content? On one hand, people have the right to express themselves, even if others find it distasteful. On the other hand, if someone's content makes the author uncomfortable, they are within their rights to disengage. However, ghosting without explanation is often seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut maybe in this case, since the author wasn't in a relationship with the guy, just talking to him, ending communication isn't necessarily wrong. The author isn't obligated to continue a conversation if they find the other person's values or attitudes incompatible. However, the lack of communication can be harsh. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the reason for ending communication is valid (i.e., the guy's posts are off-putting and the author doesn't want to engage further), then maybe the author isn't the asshole. The guy might be the one with problematic views, so ending contact isn't the issue. The problem might be the ghosting itself, but the user's answer might hinge on whether the author's reason is justified. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, if someone has a valid reason to end contact, even if they don't explain it, they might not be considered the asshole. However, ghosting is often criticized regardless of the reason because it's inconsiderate. But in this case, the author's reason is about the other person's content being a deal-breaker. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason, even though the method (ghosting) is rude. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether their method is the best. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a legitimate reason to disengage, even if the way they did it was abrupt. The problem is with the guy's posts, not the author's decision to stop talking. The author isn't obligated to explain or justify their actions, especially if they find the other person's content incompatible with their values.\n"
