I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explaining, and the reason given is the guy's social media posts. The posts mentioned are about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and sleeping with a friend's bestie. The author finds these posts immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting someone is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person without closure. But the author has a reason: the guy's social media content. The question is whether the content was enough justification for ghosting without an explanation.\n\nThe guy's posts do seem to reflect certain attitudes, especially about relationships. The first meme suggests he's looking for a faithful relationship but the phrasing is a bit crass. The second post is more problematic, implying that if someone puts him in the friendzone, he should then pursue their friend's bestie. That's not just immature; it's also objectifying and potentially manipulative. \n\nThe author is 23, so they might be more sensitive to these issues. They might feel that such attitudes are incompatible with what they're looking for in a partner. If the posts are a reflection of his values and behavior, then the author's decision to disengage makes sense. However, ghosting without any communication is still a point against them because it can be hurtful and lacks consideration.\n\nBut there's a balance. If the posts are a red flag indicating he's not trustworthy or respectful, then the author is making a judgment call based on those red flags. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the content of the posts. Since the author felt strongly enough about these issues to want to end contact, maybe they're not wrong for doing so, even if it's abrupt.\n\nHowever, the right thing to do might have been to explain their reasons for disengaging, even if briefly. That way, they could have been honest without going into detail. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the posts truly were off-putting and indicative of his character, then the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be in a relationship with someone like that. The ghosting is the issue, but the reason might mitigate that. So the answer would depend on whether the content justifies the action.\n\nIn the end, people have the right to choose who they want to be in a relationship with. If the guy's posts are a deal-breaker, then the author isn't wrong for walking away. The ghosting is rude, but the underlying reason might be valid. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the guy's posts were a valid reason to disengage.\n"
