I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy without explaining why. The reason given is the guy's social media posts, which the author finds immature and gross. The posts include a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another about the friendzone and sleeping with a friend's bestie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the guy were talking, and the author decided to ghost him. Ghosting means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. The user is asking if that's justified here.\n\nThe guy's social media content is key. The posts mentioned could be seen as objectifying women or having double standards. The author found them immature and offensive. At 23, the author might be looking for more maturity in a potential partner. The question is whether the author's reaction is reasonable.\n\nGhosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person without closure. However, if the content was a deal-breaker for the author, maybe they had a right to disengage. The author didn't engage in a conversation about it, which could have been better, but the content itself might have been enough to decide not to pursue a relationship.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, it's their choice to disengage if they find the other person's views incompatible. However, ghosting is still considered rude regardless of the reason. The key point is whether the author's reason is valid. Since the guy's posts are about wanting a faithful girlfriend while joking about the friendzone and sleeping with someone else's friend, it could indicate immaturity or double standards. The author's decision to not pursue a relationship isn't the issue, but the method (ghosting) is problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the reason is valid, then maybe not. But if the author is wrong for ghosting despite a valid reason, then the answer might be A. But sometimes, people argue that if the reason is justified, even ghosting isn't the person's fault. So maybe B is the answer here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the reason for ghosting is acceptable. Since the author found the guy's views incompatible and offensive, they might not be in the wrong. So B.\n"
