I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of their social media posts. The author stopped talking to the guy without explaining why, and the guy keeps trying to contact them. The social media content mentioned includes a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and a picture suggesting he's interested in a friend's bestie if he's friendzoned. The author finds this immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. The author's decision is based on the guy's social media posts, which they find unappealing and inappropriate. They mention values like maturity and wanting a faithful relationship. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation, but if the person's behavior is a red flag, maybe it's justified.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Ghosting itself is often seen as inconsiderate, but if the person's posts indicate a lack of respect for others or potential for future issues, maybe the author had a valid reason. The other person's content could be seen as disrespectful towards women, which is a significant issue. If the author values maturity and respect, they might feel justified in cutting off the interaction without a detailed explanation, especially if further communication would be uncomfortable or harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the guy's posts are problematic, the author could have communicated their reasons for disengaging. But since there wasn't an established relationship, the author isn't obligated to explain. The question is whether the act of ghosting is wrong. In social norms, it's usually better to be honest, but if the person is a stranger or only an acquaintance, ghosting might be acceptable to avoid uncomfortable interactions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions might be justified given the content they found offensive. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
