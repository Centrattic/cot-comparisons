I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy they were talking to, without explaining why. The guy keeps trying to contact them. The reason given is that the guy's social media content is immature and off-putting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting, by definition, is cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. That's generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the author has their own reasons here. They found the guy's posts about not wanting to be friendzoned and using terms like \"hoes\" and \"fuck your other friend's bestie\" to be gross and immature. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. Social media content is a personal choice, but when it affects how someone is perceived in a potential relationship, it becomes a valid concern. The author is choosing to distance themselves because the guy's behavior and posts conflict with their own values or what they find acceptable. \n\nHowever, the act of ghosting itself is problematic regardless of the reason. Even if the reason is valid, not providing any explanation can be hurtful. The author might have a legitimate reason to disengage, but the method\u2014ghosting\u2014lacks consideration for the other person's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy might have been using social media to express his preferences, which are indeed cringe or immature from the author's perspective. The author has the right to disengage if they find the content offensive or unappealing. But the way they went about it could be the issue here.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for ghosting, or is the issue the method rather than the reason? If the content is a deal-breaker and the author felt uncomfortable, then ending communication is understandable. The problem is the lack of communication in ending it. \n\nIn many discussions about ghosting, the consensus is that it's inconsiderate regardless of the reason. However, some argue that if someone's behavior is toxic or harmful, ghosting can be a form of self-protection. The line is blurry here. The guy's posts are problematic, but not necessarily abusive. They're more about his preferences in relationships, which the author finds immature. \n\nThe author's reasoning might be valid, but the action of ghosting without explanation could still be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because ghosting is generally discouraged, even if the reason is valid. Alternatively, if the content is a red flag and the author is justified in cutting things off, then maybe not (B). \n\nI think the key here is that while the author's reason is understandable, the method of ending communication is where they might be in the wrong. So the answer could be A. However, others might argue that the reason justifies the ghosting, making the answer B. It's a bit of a toss-up, but considering societal norms around communication, ghosting is usually frowned upon regardless of the reason. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for choosing to ghost instead of having an honest conversation.\n"
