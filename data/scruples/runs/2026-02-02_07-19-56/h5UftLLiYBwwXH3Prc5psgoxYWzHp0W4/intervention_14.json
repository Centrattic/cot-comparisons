I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to someone because of his social media posts. The key points are the posts he made: one about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and hooking up with a friend's bestie.\n\nThe author is 23 and finds these posts immature and gross. They justified ghosting because of those posts. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so without explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused, but people do it for various reasons. The main issue here is whether the reason for ghosting is valid. The posts in question are about hypermasculine or inappropriate content. The author found them off-putting, which is subjective. However, if someone's social media presence is a problem for the other person, it's their prerogative to disengage. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't communicate their feelings, which could have been respectful. But they did mention that the content was a dealbreaker for them. So, while ghosting isn't ideal, the reason might be valid. The posts could indicate a lack of maturity or respect for others, which the author has every right to find unacceptable. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they had a personal reason to disengage. The problem is the lack of communication, but the decision to distance themselves isn't unwarranted. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
