I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting a guy based on his social media posts. The author explains that the guy posted some memes about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice, faithful girlfriend,\" as well as a friendzoning meme. The author found these posts immature and a turn off, so they ghosted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off all communication without explanation. The author did that, which can be hurtful. But the reason given is the guy's social media content. The key here is whether the content was offensive enough to justify ghosting without an explanation.\n\nThe guy's posts do seem a bit cringey and maybe a bit objectifying, but it's also possible that the author took them out of context. The memes might be part of his personality or humor, which the author found unattractive. However, the author didn't communicate their feelings, which is part of the issue. Ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if the reason is valid. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's actions might be justified if the content was genuinely offensive, but since it's about personal preferences in a potential partner, it's a bit subjective. The lack of communication is a problem, but the decision to end the interaction based on personal values might not be wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have expressed their discomfort instead of ghosting. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and impact. The impact here is the ghosting, which is hurtful, but the intent is based on personal boundaries. If the author felt the guy's posts were incompatible with their values, maybe it's okay. But the right approach would have been to communicate. Since they didn't, that's where the problem lies. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author has the right to set boundaries based on personal preferences. However, the ghosting without explanation is the issue. The problem is that the question asks if the author is in the wrong, and the main action is ghosting. So maybe the answer is A (Yes), because ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe the community would say that the author isn't in the wrong because the reason is about personal taste, but the method of ending it is. However, in AITA, the focus is on the action and the reason. Since the reason is about personal preferences, not something harmful, the author might be seen as not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
