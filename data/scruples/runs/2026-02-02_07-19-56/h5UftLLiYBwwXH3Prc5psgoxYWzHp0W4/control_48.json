I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted a guy because of his social media posts is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author stopped communicating with someone without telling them why, and the reason given is the guy's social media content, which the author finds immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as a negative action because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the reason for ghosting can influence the perception. The guy posted memes about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another about the \"friendzone\" and sleeping with a friend's bestie. The author finds these posts immature and a red flag for someone their age (23).\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key here is whether the reason for ghosting is justified. If the author felt that the person's values or attitudes were incompatible with their own, especially if they were a dealbreaker, then maybe it's understandable. The author didn't want to engage with someone they saw as immature and potentially problematic. However, ghosting without explanation can still hurt the other person, even if the reason is valid.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to set boundaries and choose who they engage with. If the author found the content offensive or a sign of poor character, it's reasonable to disengage. On the other hand, communication is important in any interaction. Ghosting might be harsh, but given that the author didn't want to engage with someone whose views they found off-putting, maybe it's not the author's fault.\n\nAlso, considering the content of the posts: promoting infidelity or disrespect towards others could be valid reasons to distance oneself. The author is within their right to decide not to pursue a relationship with someone whose values clash. So while ghosting isn't ideal, the reasoning here might justify it.\n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, the community often looks at intent and whether the action was reasonable. The author's intent was to protect their own standards, not to be cruel. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
