I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for ghosting someone based on their social media posts. The author explains that they stopped communicating with a guy because of his posts, which they found immature and gross. The guy in question is 23 and posted memes about \"running away from hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" as well as another about the friendzone and hooking up with friends' best friends. The author thinks that at 23, such behavior is inappropriate and a turn-off.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting. I need to decide if their actions are justified or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. However, there are contexts where people might justify it. The author's reasoning is based on the guy's social media content, which they find off-putting. They might feel that his posts indicate a lack of maturity or respect for relationships, which could be a red flag for them.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries and disengage from interactions that make them uncomfortable. If they feel his posts are disrespectful or immature, they might not be a good match, and ghosting could be a way to end the conversation without confrontation. On the other hand, ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, especially if they were expecting a real relationship. The guy might have been investing time and effort, only to be ignored without reason.\n\nBut the key here is mutual consent and respect in communication. The author is within their rights to stop engaging if they're not interested. However, the lack of communication could still be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether the author's justification outweighs the rudeness of ghosting.\n\nAnother angle: The guy's social media content could be a reflection of his personality or values. If the author finds those values incompatible with their own, it's reasonable to disengage. They\u2019re not obligated to continue a conversation if they find the person's views objectionable. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nBut some might argue that social media behavior doesn't always reflect someone's true character, and making snap judgments based on posts could be unfair. Yet, the author is just stating their opinion based on what they see, which they find unappealing. It's their prerogative to walk away from a potential relationship that doesn't align with their standards.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" factor, the author's actions might be seen as justified if they're protecting their own boundaries. The alternative is to explain why they're not interested, which is more considerate, but the author chose to ghost. However, the main issue isn't the ghosting itself but whether the decision to ghost was reasonable given the context.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their values. While ghosting is abrupt, their reasoning is valid from their perspective. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
