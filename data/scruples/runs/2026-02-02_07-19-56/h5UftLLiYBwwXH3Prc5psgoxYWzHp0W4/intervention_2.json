I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author stopped talking to a guy without telling him why. The reason given is the guy's social media posts, which the author finds immature and gross. The guy keeps trying to contact them and wants to go out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what ghosting entails. Ghosting is when someone suddenly cuts off communication without explanation. It's generally considered rude or inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. But the author's reasoning here is that the guy's online content was a deal-breaker for them. \n\nThe key points here are the social media posts. The guy posted a meme about wanting a faithful girlfriend and another about the friendzone and sleeping with someone's friend's bestie. The author finds these posts immature and a turn-off. They are 23, so they might be looking for someone more mature. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting. On one hand, the author has the right to disengage from someone if their values or behaviors clash. If the guy's posts reflect his personality or how he treats others, the author might feel justified in cutting ties. On the other hand, ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate regardless of the reason. It doesn't give the other person a chance to explain or change their behavior.\n\nBut there's a middle ground here. The author's decision is based on the guy's public posts, which might indicate his character. If the posts are offensive or show immaturity, the author might feel it's better to avoid a relationship with someone like that. However, the method of cutting off communication without explanation is where the issue lies. Even if the reason is valid, not communicating can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle: The guy is trying to reach out and wants to go out. The author's ghosting might have left him confused. But if the author found his posts unacceptable, maybe the posts themselves are a red flag that the author doesn't want to engage with further. \n\nIn relationships or potential relationships, being upfront about deal-breakers is usually better. Ghosting can be harmful, but sometimes people ghost for valid reasons. The question is whether the author's reason is sufficient to justify ghosting. If the posts are a major turn-off and indicate immaturity, then maybe the author is justified. However, the lack of communication is still a problem. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the reason for ghosting is valid enough to overlook the inconsiderate method. The community often debates this. Some say it's okay to ghost if the other person's actions are off-putting, while others argue that honesty is better. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering social norms, ghosting is generally frowned upon, but the reason can affect that. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if the guy's posts are a deal-breaker, but the act of ghosting is still rude. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just the act of ghosting. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the reason is valid, even though the method is inconsiderate. But some might argue that the author should have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting. Hmm.\n"
