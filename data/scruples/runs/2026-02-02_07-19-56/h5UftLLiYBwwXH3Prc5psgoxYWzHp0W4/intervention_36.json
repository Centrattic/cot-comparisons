I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author decided to stop talking to a guy without telling him why because of the guy's social media posts. The guy keeps trying to contact them.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the guy's posts are immature and gross. The posts mentioned are about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting to friendzone someone to pursue their friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds this behavior unattractive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if ghosting is acceptable in this context. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. The author didn't tell the guy why they stopped talking. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nThe guy's social media content is a public display of his personality and values. The author is reacting to that. If someone's online presence shows they have values or attitudes that clash with the author's, it's reasonable to disengage. But the act of ghosting might be the issue here. Without communication, the guy is left confused and trying to reach out.\n\nIs it fair for the author to decide based on his public posts? People can choose who they want to interact with based on others' public expressions. The author isn't wrong in their values. However, the method of disengagement\u2014ghosting\u2014might be where the judgment comes in. Some might argue that a direct conversation is better, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to explain themselves if they feel the person isn't a good fit. Social media is part of a person's identity, and forming opinions based on that is common. But ghosting can be hurtful even if justified by the person doing it. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The author's reason is based on the guy's public posts, which might be a valid personal choice. 2) The method of cutting off communication without explanation is where the potential issue lies. \n\nIf the author felt that the guy's values were incompatible, they have the right to disengage. However, the abruptness and lack of communication could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the decision is understandable. But considering the author's perspective, they might not want to engage with someone who exhibits those attitudes, which is within their right. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they have the right to choose their social interactions based on others' behavior. However, the ghosting aspect might be seen as harsh. But given the context, it's a personal choice and not necessarily wrong. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
