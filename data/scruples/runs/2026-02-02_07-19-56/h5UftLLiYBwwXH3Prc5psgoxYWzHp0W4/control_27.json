I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of their social media posts. The author ghosted a guy without explaining, and the guy keeps trying to contact them. The reason given is that the guy's posts are immature and gross, like memes about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting to sleep with someone's friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds this behavior unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation, but there are exceptions. The key here is the content of the guy's social media. The author found the posts immature and a turn-off. The question is whether ghosting without a reason is justified in this case.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to disengage from someone whose values or behavior they find objectionable. The guy's posts might indicate a lack of maturity or respect for others, which could be valid reasons to avoid a relationship. The author might feel that these posts reflect poorly on the person's character, and thus, they don't want to engage further.\n\nOn the other hand, ghosting is often frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if the author has a reason, not explaining it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the author felt that explaining would lead to more issues or that the guy wouldn't take it seriously, maybe ghosting was a way to avoid further interaction.\n\nBut the posts mentioned are public. The author could have used these as a reason during a conversation. However, they chose not to. The problem is whether the author's actions are justified. The guy was trying to get them to go out despite the author's ghosting, which might indicate he wasn't paying attention to their boundaries. The author might have felt that explaining would be too much effort or that the guy wouldn't understand. Given the content of his posts, maybe the author felt it was a waste of time to explain.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily doing something illegal or unethical, just making a personal judgment. The main issue is communication. If someone is ghosted, it's hurtful, but if the reason is valid, some might side with the author. The key is whether the author's reason is sufficient. Since the posts are about immaturity and possibly disrespectful attitudes, the author's decision to disengage could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
