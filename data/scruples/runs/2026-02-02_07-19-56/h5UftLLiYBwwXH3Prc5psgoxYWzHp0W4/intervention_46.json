I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting a guy because of his social media posts. They mention the guy posted a meme about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice\" girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and his friend's best friend. The author found these posts immature and off-putting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because you cut off communication without explanation. But the reason here is about the guy's social media content. The author felt those posts were inappropriate or unattractive. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author had the right to decide who they want to engage with. However, ghosting without a reason can leave the other person confused. But since the author found the content to be a deal-breaker, maybe it's their choice to distance themselves. \n\nBut is it the author's fault for ending the interaction? If the guy was being offensive or sharing things the author found repulsive, then it's valid. The author isn't obligated to continue a conversation if they find someone's behavior unacceptable. However, the method of ghosting is still abrupt and might be seen as rude regardless of the reason. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The other person might not like being ghosted, but the author's choice to disengage based on the content is their prerogative. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries. So answer B.\n"
