I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explanation because of his social media posts. The guy keeps trying to contact them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author mentions the guy posted a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and sleeping with a friend's bestie. The author finds these posts immature and gross, so they ghosted him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude, but people do it for various reasons. The key here is the content of the social media posts. The author felt those posts were inappropriate and a turn off. They might have found the guy's behavior or attitudes objectionable, which could be a valid reason for ending contact.\n\nHowever, ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused. But the author's reasons seem to be about personal boundaries and comfort. The guy's posts could indicate a lack of seriousness or maturity, which might not align with the author's values or what they look for in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that everyone has the right to express themselves on social media, even if it's not to everyone's taste. But if the content is offensive or makes someone uncomfortable, it's reasonable to distance oneself.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions were based on their own judgment of what's acceptable. Since ghosting is a personal choice and the reasons here are about personal boundaries, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to stop communication, even if the method was abrupt.\n"
