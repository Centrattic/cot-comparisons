I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of their social media posts.\n\nFirst, the author ghosted the guy without explaining. The reason given is the guy's posts about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" plus another meme about the friendzone and his friends' bestie. The author finds this immature and gross, especially for someone their age (23). They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ghosting without explanation, the reason being social media content, and whether that's justified.\n\nGhosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. However, the author has a reason. The guy's posts seem to have double meanings or maybe offensive content. The author might feel that the guy's attitudes are not aligned with their values, especially regarding relationships. \n\nBut is it the author's place to judge based on social media? People have freedom of expression, and unless the posts are harassing or threatening, maybe the author is overreacting. However, the posts in question could be seen as promoting casual or disrespectful relationships, which the author finds off-putting. \n\nThe author's decision to ghost is a personal choice. They might not be the asshole for ending the conversation if they found the content incompatible with their values. However, the lack of communication is a downside. But considering the context, maybe it's understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their comfort and values by ending the interaction, even if the method (ghosting) isn't ideal. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. Since the reason is about personal boundaries, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
