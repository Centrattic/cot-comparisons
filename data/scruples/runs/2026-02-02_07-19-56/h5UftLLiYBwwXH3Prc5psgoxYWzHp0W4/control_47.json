I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for ghosting someone because of his social media posts. The guy they ghosted keeps trying to contact them. The reason given is that the guy posted a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and sleeping with friends' best friends. The user finds that immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you cut off communication without explanation. However, people have different boundaries. If the posts were offensive or made the author uncomfortable, maybe it's understandable. But the key here is that the author didn't explain their reasoning, leading the other person to be confused and keep reaching out.\n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to set boundaries and disengage from interactions that don't align with their values. The content of the posts might be seen as disrespectful or promiscuous, which could be a valid reason for the author to disengage. On the other hand, ghosting without communication can leave the other person in the dark, which isn't ideal. But considering the context, maybe the author's actions are justified if they felt the person's values clashed with theirs. The question is whether the author is wrong for choosing to disengage without explanation. Since the posts were public, the author might not feel obligated to explain their decision. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
