Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was talking to a guy but then decided to ghost him. The reason given is the guy's social media content, which includes a meme about \"running away from hoes\" and a picture referencing the \"friendzone\" with a suggestive message. The author finds these posts immature, gross, and a turn-off, especially since they're both 23 years old. They're wondering if they're the asshole for ghosting without explanation.\n\nNow, considering the context. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off communication abruptly without any notice or explanation. It can be seen as rude or disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the reason for ghosting can influence how it's perceived. The guy's posts are about being with a \"nice faithful girlfriend\" and making jokes about the friendzone, which might be considered immature or not serious. The author could find these red flags that indicate the guy isn't respectful or mature enough for a relationship. \n\nThe key factors here are: the content of the guy's social media posts, the age of the individuals (23), and the act of ghosting. If the posts are offensive or show a lack of respect towards others, that could be a valid reason to end communication. However, the author chose to ghost rather than explain why they were uncomfortable. Ghosting, even for a good reason, might still be seen as inconsiderate because the recipient is left in the dark.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if the guy's posts are indeed disrespectful or inappropriate, then it's reasonable to distance oneself. However, the method of ending the interaction matters. Ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if the reason is justified. The author could have been more direct and explained their discomfort with the content. That might have been a better approach, but the act of ending the conversation is not inherently wrong if there's a valid reason. \n\nSo, the question is whether the reason (guy's social media posts) is a legitimate grounds for cutting off communication, and if the method (ghosting) is acceptable. If the posts are truly offensive or indicate poor character, then the decision to stop talking isn't wrong. But the way they did it could be seen as a flaw. However, in many cases, people do ghost for reasons they find important, especially if they feel uncomfortable or see red flags. \n\nThe community's view on \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) often considers both the reason and the approach. While the content of the guy's posts is questionable, the author's action of ghosting might be seen as a bit harsh, but not necessarily in the wrong, especially if they felt the need to avoid someone with such attitudes. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reason for ghosting is valid, but the method could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the guy's posts are problematic and the author's judgment is based on that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that ghosting is always wrong regardless of the reason. Need to weigh these aspects.\n"
