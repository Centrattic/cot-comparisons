I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone for their social media posts is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author stopped talking to a guy without explaining, and the reason given is the guy's posts. The posts mentioned are about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about being friendzoned and wanting to \"fuck your other friends bestie.\" The author finds these posts immature and a turn-off, leading them to ghost the guy. The guy is trying to contact them still.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Ghosting is generally considered rude because you cut off communication without explanation. However, the author has a reason tied to content that might be offensive or unappealing. The posts do seem to promote casual sex and maybe objectify women, which could be a red flag. The author's reaction is based on their personal boundaries and values. \n\nBut the key point here is the act of ghosting. Even if the reason is valid, cutting off communication without any explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt. However, sometimes people do this to avoid confrontation or because they feel the need to disengage quickly. The question is whether the author's action is wrong. If we consider that people have the right to set boundaries and disengage from interactions that don't align with their values, then the author isn't wrong. On the other hand, if the posts don't directly affect their interaction, the ghosting might be harsh. But in this case, the posts are part of the guy's public persona, and the author is reacting to that. \n\nSo, while ghosting is often frowned upon, in this context where the posts reflect the person's attitudes that the author finds incompatible, maybe it's not the author's fault. The answer might be B (not wrong) because the author is protecting their own comfort and setting boundaries. However, some might argue that even if the posts are off-putting, the author should have communicated their reason instead of ghosting. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the posts are a legitimate concern, then the author's action is justified. So the answer is B.\n"
