I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The main issue here is the reason for ghosting. The author mentions that the guy posted memes about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another about the friendzone and hooking up with someone else's BFF. The author found these posts immature and a turn-off, so they decided to ghost him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and doesn't provide closure. However, the reason for ghosting can affect the judgment. If the posts were offensive or problematic, maybe the author had a valid reason. The posts seem to use casual, possibly degrading language towards women, which could be seen as misogynistic. The author might have felt that engaging with someone who holds such views is not acceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't give an explanation, which the guy might deserve. But if the content is truly unacceptable to the author, maybe they're justified in cutting off communication. Also, considering the age mentioned (23), the posts might be seen as more childish and not indicative of mature values, which the author is right to avoid. \n\nSo, while ghosting isn't ideal, the reason here could be a legitimate personal boundary issue. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they found the content offensive and chose to distance themselves. The key is whether the content was a deal-breaker for the author, which it seems it was. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
