I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy because of his social media posts. The guy posted a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another about the friendzone and sleeping with someone's friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds these posts immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. The author didn't tell the guy why they stopped talking. The guy is trying to contact them again. The question is whether the author was right to ghost him based on his social media content.\n\nSocial media content is public, so the author had a reason based on what they saw. The posts might indicate the guy has inappropriate or predatory tendencies. The author might feel uncomfortable continuing the interaction because of those values. However, ghosting without explanation can be hurtful. The guy might not know why he was cut off, leading to confusion.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author had a valid reason. If the posts are indeed problematic, like promoting manipulation or disrespect towards others, then the author's decision is more understandable. However, maybe the guy's posts are just in poor taste but not malicious. The line between immaturity and something more serious could be thin here.\n\nThe community's response to such situations often depends on the severity. If the content is harmful or abusive, then the author is justified. If it's just tasteless humor, maybe the author is overreacting. The age is 23, which is young, but the author might be more mature in their views. The question is whether it's acceptable to ghost based on public posts that someone finds offensive.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, the community often considers intent and harm. If the author's reason is valid and the posts are indeed problematic, then the author isn't the asshole. But if the reaction is disproportionate, then maybe they are. The guy's posts could be seen as immature but not necessarily crossing a line. However, if the author is uncomfortable, their reaction is personal. So, the answer depends on whether the posts are genuinely harmful or just in poor taste. Given the examples, \"running away from hoes\" could be sexist, and the other meme about the friendzone suggests manipulative behavior. Those might be valid concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
