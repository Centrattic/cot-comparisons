I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're an a**hole for ghosting someone because of the guy's social media posts. The guy posted some memes that seem to have inappropriate or maybe even offensive content. The author found it immature and a turn-off, so they decided to cut contact without explaining.\n\nHmm, first, ghosting is generally considered rude because you don't communicate. But the context here is important. If the guy's posts are offensive or make the author uncomfortable, maybe it's understandable. But is it the author's place to ghost over social media content? Like, the guy's posts might be his personal opinions or humor. The author didn't engage with him, but did the guy's posts actually affect their interactions? If they were just getting to know each other, the author might have valid reasons to discontinue the conversation if they felt incompatible or if the content was off-putting. However, not explaining why could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the posts were genuinely offensive, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to distance themselves. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are the content of the posts and whether it's reasonable to base a decision on that. I think the author is justified in their feelings, so they might not be the a**hole here. So answer B.\n"
