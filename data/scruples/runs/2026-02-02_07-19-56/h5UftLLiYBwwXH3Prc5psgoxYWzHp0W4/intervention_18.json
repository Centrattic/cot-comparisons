I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person ghosted someone because of the content he posted on social media. The author found the guy's posts immature and off-putting, so they decided to cut contact without explaining. The guy is trying to reach out again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. The author mentions that the guy's social media posts were about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, but also a joke about the friendzone and sleeping with a friend's bestie. These posts seem to reflect a certain attitude towards relationships and women. The author finds that gross and immature, so they cut off communication. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it involves no explanation and cutting off contact abruptly. However, people have the right to set boundaries in their personal interactions. If the author felt that the guy's posts were a deal-breaker for them, maybe it's their right to disengage. But since they didn't explain, the other person is left confused and seeking answers, which can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's posts do seem problematic. The memes he shared might indicate a lack of respect for women or a superficial view of relationships. The author is justified in wanting to distance themselves from someone whose values or attitudes clash with their own. However, the abruptness of ghosting without any communication could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author had a reason to disengage, but the way they did it (ghosting) is typically seen as inconsiderate. But if the content was a major turn-off, maybe it's understandable. The answer hinges on whether the author's reason justifies the method of ending contact. If the author felt that engaging with the guy was not worth their emotional well-being, then maybe it's not their fault. However, the lack of communication is a point against them. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often criticize ghosting regardless of the reason because it leaves the other person hanging. But if the content was truly offensive or incompatible with the author's values, then maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a bit of a balance between respecting their own boundaries and being considerate to the other person.\n"
