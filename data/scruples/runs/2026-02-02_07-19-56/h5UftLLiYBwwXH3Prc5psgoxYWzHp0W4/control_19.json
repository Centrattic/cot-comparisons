I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who posted some memes and a picture on social media that the author finds immature and offensive. The author then decided to ghost him without explaining why.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, the context here is important. The author mentions that the guy's posts are offensive and they found them to be a turn-off. The content includes things like \"running away from hoes\" and a picture suggesting he wants to \"fuck your other friends bestie\" after being friend-zoned. These posts could be seen as objectifying women or treating relationships in a disrespectful way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author's actions are justified. The author is not in a relationship with the guy; they were just talking. The reason for cutting off communication is related to the guy's public behavior, which the author finds unacceptable. It's about personal boundaries and values. If someone's public behavior conflicts with what you find morally okay, it's reasonable to distance yourself.\n\nHowever, ghosting is often criticized because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. But in this case, the author might feel that explaining their reasons would be a waste of time or that the guy's behavior isn't worth engaging with. There's also the aspect of consent and mutual respect in communication. If the author felt that the guy's posts were a deal-breaker, then it makes sense to stop interacting. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that ghosting is still rude regardless of the reason. But the author isn't in a relationship, so they might not have an obligation to explain their decision. Also, the content the guy posted could be seen as promoting disrespectful attitudes towards women, which many people would find unacceptable. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author's reason is based on the guy's public behavior that they find offensive. Ghosting, while abrupt, might be justified here as the author is setting a boundary based on the guy's values not aligning with theirs. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
