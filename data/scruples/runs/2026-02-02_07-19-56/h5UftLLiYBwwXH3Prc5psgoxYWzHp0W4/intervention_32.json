Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting this guy because of his social media posts. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in a conversation with a guy, both 23 years old. The author decided to ghost him without explaining why. The guy is now trying to reach out and wants to go out. The reason given is that the guy posts things on social media that the author finds immature and gross. Examples are a meme about \"running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\" and a picture with the caption \"if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\". The author is asking if they're the asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of ghosting. Ghosting generally refers to suddenly cutting off all communication without any explanation. It's often seen as inconsiderate because the person being ghosted is left with no closure or understanding. However, the justification here is the content of the guy's social media posts. The author finds them immature and off-putting. \n\nNow, are those posts really a deal-breaker? The memes in question seem to reflect certain attitudes, maybe objectifying women or being disrespectful towards relationships. If the author found that behavior unappealing, it's understandable that they might not want to pursue a relationship. Social media can be a window into someone's character, so if those posts show a lack of maturity or respect, avoiding them makes sense.\n\nBut is it fair to ghost someone based on that? The problem with ghosting is the lack of communication. The author didn't explain why they were cutting off contact, which can be hurtful. However, the alternative is to have a conversation about the posts. If the author felt that the guy's posts were a major red flag, they might prefer not to engage further. Still, providing some feedback could be more respectful, even if it's brief.\n\nThe guy's attempts to contact her after being ghosted might be annoying, but his behavior on social media is what led her to ghost him. The question is whether his posts were enough to warrant cutting off communication. If someone's social media presence includes things that are clearly disrespectful or align with values the author doesn't agree with, it's a valid reason to disengage. However, the method of cutting off is important. \n\nIn some cases, people might say that if you have a reason, even if it's not a major one, it's better to communicate it. But if the author felt that the guy's posts indicated a fundamental incompatibility or values they can't accept, then maybe it's not wrong. On the other hand, if the author is being overly judgmental or if the posts are not as bad as they think, then maybe the author is inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Are the social media posts a legitimate reason to stop communicating? 2) Is ghosting an appropriate response given that reason?\n\nFor point 1, if the posts are about disrespecting women or being immature, that's a valid reason. For point 2, ghosting is typically frowned upon because of the lack of communication. However, if the author felt that explaining would be too confronting or that there's no point in continuing the conversation, maybe they have a reason to ghost. But ideally, a brief explanation would be better.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is based on the guy's posts being a turn-off. If the author's standards are reasonable (and they are here), then they aren't in the wrong. However, the act of ghosting is often seen as the asshole move regardless of the reason. So there's a conflict between the justification and the method.\n\nIn some communities, if someone has poor values, it's acceptable to cut them off without explanation. Others might argue that even if the reason is valid, not being honest about it is still the asshole part. The line is blurry here. The author's posts are definitely problematic, but the abruptness of the ghosting could still be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nMaybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because ghosting is generally considered rude, even if the reason is valid. Or B (No) because the reason is significant enough. I need to decide based on common viewpoints. In AITA forums, people often consider that if you have a valid reason, you're not the asshole, but the method can affect that. So if the author's reason is a deal-breaker, then it's not their fault. But the way they handled it (ghosting) is still questionable.\n\nPerhaps the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because the content of the guy's social media is a legitimate reason to disengage, and the author's boundaries are valid. Ghosting is a bad approach, but if the reason is strong, like someone's disrespectful behavior, it might be excusable. However, the traditional view is that ghosting is the asshole move unless there's an extreme situation. Since this is about social media posts, which are public, maybe the author is justified. But I'm not sure. The answer depends on whether the reason is considered a strong enough justification for ghosting.\n"
