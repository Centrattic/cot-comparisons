I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone for their social media posts is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author stopped talking to a guy without telling him why, and the reason given is the guy's posts about wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend\" and a meme about friendzoning and sleeping with friends' besties. The author thinks it's immature and a turnoff.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the ethics here. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. But the author had a reason\u2014content that the person found off-putting. The guy's social media posts might indicate a lack of maturity or respect in relationships. For example, the meme about running away from \"hoes\" could imply a double standard or objectification, which is problematic. The other post about friendzoning and sleeping with others' friends' besties also suggests a lack of respect for others' relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting. On one hand, ghosting is unkind and inconsiderate. The guy might deserve an explanation if they were in a meaningful conversation. On the other hand, the author felt that the guy's content was gross and immature, which could be a valid reason to disengage. The author might not be obligated to continue a conversation if the content is harmful or disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the key here is the context of their interaction. Were they in a committed relationship or just casual talking? If it's a casual chat, the author might have the right to disengage if they find the content off-putting. But even so, ghosting without explanation leaves the other person hanging. The author could have politely ended the conversation instead of ghosting.\n\nBut considering that the guy's posts are about his views on relationships, which the author finds unacceptable, it's reasonable for the author to want to distance themselves. The author isn't in a relationship with him, so they aren't bound to explain their reasons. However, the act of ghosting is still inconsiderate. So there's a balance here between standing by one's values and treating the other person respectfully.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons for disengaging due to the guy's content, the method of ghosting is inconsiderate. But whether that makes them \"in the wrong\" depends on perspective. If the focus is on the ghosting, then the author is in the wrong. However, if the focus is on the reason (the guy's inappropriate posts), then the author is not in the wrong. The question is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation as a whole. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the reason for ghosting is about the guy's content, which is a personal choice. But there's a nuance here.\n"
