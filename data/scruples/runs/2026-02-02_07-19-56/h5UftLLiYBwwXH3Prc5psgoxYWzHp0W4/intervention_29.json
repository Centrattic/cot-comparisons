I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explanation, citing his social media posts as the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around communication in relationships or interactions. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off contact without giving a reason. Even if the person has issues, not responding at all can leave the other person confused and hurt. But there are exceptions, like if the person is abusive or harmful in some way.\n\nLooking at the guy's posts: one meme says he's running away from \"hoes\" because he wants a \"nice, faithful girlfriend.\" The other is about being friendzoned but then wanting to sleep with someone's friend's bestie. These posts might be seen as immature or objectifying others, which the author finds off-putting. The author is 23 and finds this behavior gross and inappropriate for their age.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the guy's posts show immaturity and bad values. But is that a valid reason to ghost? Well, if someone's values or behavior are a deal-breaker for you, it's reasonable to disengage. However, the method of disengagement (ghosting) is where the issue lies. Instead of cutting off contact abruptly, a direct but respectful conversation might be better. \n\nThe key points here are: Is the guy's behavior really a problem? The author thinks it's immature and gross. That's subjective, but if someone's content makes you uncomfortable, it's okay to distance yourself. However, the way to do that matters. Ghosting is often frowned upon because it's dismissive. But if the person is toxic or harmful, some might argue it's justified.\n\nIn this case, the guy's posts might not be illegal or deeply harmful, but they reflect poor judgment. The author is within their rights to decide not to pursue a relationship with someone whose values clash. However, the lack of communication is the main issue. The author's action isn't malicious but is still inconsiderate. \n\nOn the scale of right vs. wrong, the author's decision to disengage is understandable, but the method (ghosting) is where they're in the wrong. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their reasons, even if their reasoning is valid.\n"
