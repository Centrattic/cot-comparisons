I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explanation, and the reason given is the guy's social media posts. The posts mentioned are a meme about wanting a faithful girlfriend but also friendzoning and then sleeping with friends' best friends, and another post that seems to encourage similar behavior. The author is 23 and finds this immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without any explanation. However, the reason here is about content that the author finds offensive or inappropriate. The guy's posts might indicate a lack of respect for others or a problematic attitude towards relationships. \n\nThe author's actions were a direct response to these posts. They felt that the guy's behavior and attitudes were not aligned with their values, especially regarding maturity and respect in relationships. Ghosting could be justified if the content was harmful or abusive, but it's unclear if that's the case here. However, the author's decision to stop communicating might be harsh, but given the content, they have their reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting someone off completely without any communication might not be the best approach. The author could have addressed their concerns directly. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not if they could have handled it better. Since the reason for ghosting is based on the guy's posts that the author finds unacceptable, the author might not be in the wrong. Their values are their own, and they have the right to distance themselves from someone whose views they disagree with.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting on their own values and boundaries, even if the method (ghosting) is considered rude. The content of the posts is the main issue here, and the author's decision is based on that.\n"
