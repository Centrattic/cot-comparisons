I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy because of his social media posts. The guy posted a meme about running away from \"hoes\" to find a faithful girlfriend and another about being friendzoned and then pursuing someone else's bestie. The author finds this immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if ghosting is justified here. Ghosting means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author didn't tell the guy why they stopped talking. The reason is based on the guy's social media content, which the author finds gross and immature. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Well, people have different values and boundaries. If someone's social media presence shows they prioritize shallow or potentially manipulative behavior, that's a red flag. The author might feel that these posts indicate a lack of maturity or respect for others, which is a valid concern. So, choosing to end the interaction to avoid further engagement could be seen as self-respect and setting boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason. The guy might feel confused or rejected without closure. But the author's reason is based on the guy's public behavior, which is something the author has a right to take into account when deciding who to interact with. The author isn't in a relationship, so it's about personal choice in who they engage with. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set boundaries based on the other person's public posts and the appropriateness of ghosting. While ghosting isn't ideal, if the behavior being ghosted over is genuinely a deal-breaker, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The posts do seem to indicate a lack of maturity and possibly problematic attitudes towards relationships. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're justified in cutting off someone whose values and behavior they find unacceptable, even if the method of ghosting is abrupt. It's about personal choice and self-respect.\n"
