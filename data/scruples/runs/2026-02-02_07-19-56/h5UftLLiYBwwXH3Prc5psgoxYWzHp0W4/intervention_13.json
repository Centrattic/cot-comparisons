I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ghosting someone based on their social media posts. The author mentions that the guy posted a meme about \"running away from hoes\" and another about wanting to \"fuck your other friend's bestie\" if he's friendzoned. The author found this immature and a turn-off, so they ghosted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around ghosting. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and lacks communication. However, people do it for various reasons. The key here is the reason behind the ghosting. The author is justified if their reason is valid and they feel uncomfortable continuing the interaction. \n\nLooking at the guy's posts: the memes and quotes he's sharing come off as disrespectful towards women, using terms like \"hoes\" and making jokes about friendzoning and then pursuing someone else. This could be seen as immature or misogynistic. The author might feel that engaging with someone who holds such views is not aligned with their values, especially if they're looking for a respectful relationship. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone's behavior or expressed views make another person uncomfortable or incompatible, it's reasonable for the person to disengage. However, ghosting without any explanation is considered rude. The author could have communicated their feelings directly, but choosing not to and instead cutting off contact without explanation complicates things.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The act of ghosting itself is often seen as inconsiderate, but the reason here is about the content of the other person's posts. There's a balance between personal boundaries and social etiquette. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" because they're standing by their values, but the method of cutting off contact could be seen as abrupt. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The community might split on this. Some might say the author has a right to distance themselves from someone who expresses such views, while others might criticize the ghosting. The key point is that the author's reasoning is valid, but the execution (ghosting) is not ideal. \n\nIn the context of the AITA subreddit, people often look at both the reason and the action. The answer might be that the author isn't the asshole because their reason is valid, even if the method is not the best. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
