I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without telling him why, and the reason given is the guy's social media posts which the author found immature and gross. The guy is trying to contact them still.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. But the author has a reason here. The guy's posts are about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" which the author finds immature. Also, another post mentions friendzoning and then wanting to date someone's friend's bestie, which sounds like it's about rebounding or not respecting relationships. \n\nThe author is 23 and finds this behavior off-putting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting. On one hand, ghosting is abrupt and can be hurtful, but on the other, the author had a valid reason related to the guy's values or maturity level. If the posts indicate that the guy has a disrespectful attitude towards women or lacks emotional maturity, then the author's decision might be justified. However, even if the author's reason is valid, ghosting without explanation can still be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut in this case, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author had a reason (the guy's social media content), the content is arguably problematic, and the author might not want to engage with someone who has such views. The guy's behavior in the posts could be seen as immature or disrespectful, which is a valid reason to disengage. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to stop communication, especially if they felt the guy wasn't aligned with their values. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of ghosting being rude. However, if the author felt that explaining would lead to more conflict or the guy wouldn't take it well, maybe they had their reasons. The main question is whether the author's actions were justified. Since the guy's posts are public and the author is using that as a reason to disengage, it's not like the author is hiding a trivial issue. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had a legitimate reason to discontinue the interaction, even if the method was abrupt.\n"
