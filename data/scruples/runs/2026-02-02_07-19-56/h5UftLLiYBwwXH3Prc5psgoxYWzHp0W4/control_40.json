I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the person stopped communicating with a guy they were talking to because of his social media posts. The posts include a meme about wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend\" and another that's about the friendzone leading to hooking up with friends' besties. The author is 23 and finds this immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off communication without explanation. The author didn't tell the guy why they stopped talking, so that's the ghosting part. The question is whether that's justified here. \n\nThe guy's social media posts might indicate his attitudes towards relationships. The first meme seems to express a desire for a faithful partner, which isn't necessarily bad. The second post is more about moving on from being friendzoned by pursuing someone else's friend. That could be seen as immature or having a certain attitude about relationships and hooking up. \n\nThe author found those posts gross and immature, leading them to ghost the guy. But is that a valid reason? Well, people have different values and red flags. If the posts reflect the guy's personality or how he approaches relationships, the author might reasonably find that incompatible. \n\nHowever, ghosting is problematic because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author found the posts off-putting, it's generally better to communicate the reasons rather than disappear. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author has legitimate reasons based on the guy's values (as shown by his posts). 2) The method of cutting off contact was ghosting, which is abrupt. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on balancing the validity of the reason against the method. If the reason is valid, then the method is questionable but not necessarily making the author the asshole. AITA threads often consider the intention and the reason. If the author had a genuine issue with the guy's values, then the ghosting is inconsiderate but not entirely wrong. However, some might argue that if you find someone's values off-putting, it's better to address it directly.\n\nIn the AITA community, people often consider whether the action was justified. The posts might be seen as immature, so the author's decision to disengage is understandable. However, not explaining is the part that's called out. The author's justification is based on the guy's social media posts, which are public. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for ghosting if they found those values incompatible. But others might say that even if someone's posts are off-putting, ghosting is still rude. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the reason for ghosting was based on the guy's public posts that the author found incompatible with their values. It's not about being an asshole but about personal preferences. The ghosting is inconsiderate, but the motivation is not malicious. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
