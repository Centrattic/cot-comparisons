I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to someone they were chatting with, and the reason is the guy's social media posts. The guy posted a meme about wanting a nice, faithful girlfriend and another about the friendzone and hooking up with someone's friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds these posts immature and off-putting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting someone, which is cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, can be considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the author's reason for ghosting is related to the guy's behavior on social media, which they find inappropriate. \n\nThe key factors here are consent and communication. The author didn't communicate their feelings or the reason for ghosting, which can be hurtful. However, the content of the guy's posts might be a legitimate concern for the author. If the author felt that the guy's behavior or values were incompatible with their own, especially regarding relationships, then their decision to step back might be justified. \n\nBut the issue is the method\u2014ghosting without explanation. Even if the author has valid reasons, not communicating them can leave the other person in the dark. Social media behavior is a personal choice, and while one person might find it gross, another might not. The author's reaction is their right, but the lack of communication might be the problem here. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered better to be honest and communicate if you're not interested in continuing a relationship, even if it's just a potential one. So while the author's reasons might be understandable, the act of ghosting without explanation is where they might be in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their reasons and chose to ghost instead, which is considered rude even if the reasons are valid.\n"
