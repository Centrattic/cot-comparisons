I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone for their social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without telling him, and the reason given is the guy's posts about relationships. The posts mentioned are a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about friendzoning and sleeping with friends' besties. The author thinks these are immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. The guy is trying to contact them again, but maybe that's more about persistence than being understanding. However, the author's reason for ghosting is based on content that reflects on the guy's views about relationships. The posts seem to suggest a lack of respect for others and maybe objectification of women, which could be valid concerns. \n\nThe author might feel that these attitudes are not compatible with someone they want to build a relationship with. But is that a good enough reason to ghost without an explanation? On one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries and not engage with someone whose values they dislike. On the other hand, ghosting doesn't give the other person a chance to explain or change their behavior. \n\nHowever, since the posts are public, the author had access to this information before deciding to ghost. If the guy's social media activity was a deal-breaker, maybe the author had the right to disengage. The issue here is whether the author is being reasonable in their judgment. The posts do seem to indicate a lack of maturity, but it's also possible that the author is making assumptions based on memes.\n\nThe key factors are consent, communication, and respect. Ghosting lacks communication, which is a problem, but the author's reason is based on the guy's behavior in public. If the author found these posts unacceptable, they are not wrong in distancing themselves. However, the method of ghosting without explanation could be seen as harsh, but not necessarily making the author an asshole. The guy's persistence in trying to contact after being ghosted is also problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, while ghosting isn't ideal, the author's reason is based on the guy's public behavior that the author finds incompatible. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to disengage, even if the method could have been better. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
