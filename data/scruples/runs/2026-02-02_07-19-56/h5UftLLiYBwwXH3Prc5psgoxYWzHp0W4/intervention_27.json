I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone based on their social media posts is in the wrong. The author stopped talking to a guy without explaining why, and now the guy is trying to contact them again. The reason given is that the guy's social media content is immature and gross, like the meme about \"hoes\" and the friendzone one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is when you suddenly cut off communication without explanation. The author did that, which is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the reason for ghosting is important. The guy's posts seem to promote objectifying women and maybe even non-consensual behavior, like the friendzone joke. That's problematic from a values standpoint.\n\nSo, the author's justification is that the content is immature and a turn-off. They might be prioritizing their own comfort and values, especially since they're 23 and looking for a respectful relationship. On the other hand, the act of ghosting is still considered rude regardless of the reason. The right thing to do would be to communicate why they're ending the conversation, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal boundary issue here. The author might feel that the guy's posts are incompatible with their values. However, the fact that they didn't address it directly could be seen as a failure to handle the situation maturely. They should have confronted the issue instead of just disappearing. The key point is whether the author's actions, while based on valid concerns, were still inconsiderate.\n\nIn AITA questions, the community often looks at both the action and the reason. Ghosting is usually a red flag for the person doing it. Even if the content is off-putting, not communicating your decision is often viewed as the asshole move. The author might have had the right to disengage but the method was wrong. So the answer would be A, they are in the wrong because they ghosted without explanation, despite the reason being valid. But I need to be sure. Some people might argue that the content is so inappropriate that it's a reason to end contact, and maybe the author felt it was better to just leave it, but the community typically expects some form of communication.\n"
