I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of their social media content. The guy in question posted a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and sleeping with someone's best friend. The author stopped talking to him without explaining and now he's trying to get back in touch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the ghosting. The author finds the guy's posts immature and offensive. The content he shared seems to promote negative stereotypes about women and maybe even objectifies them. That's a valid concern. People often have the right to end interactions if they feel someone's behavior or expressions are incompatible with their values.\n\nBut then, ghosting without explanation can be seen as abrupt and potentially hurtful. The guy might be confused or upset because he doesn't know why he was cut off. However, the author had a specific reason that's personal and related to content the other person chose to share. The question is whether the author is wrong for acting on their own boundaries.\n\nIn many cases, people are encouraged to set boundaries and prioritize their comfort. If the author felt that the guy's posts were a turn-off and not aligned with what they look for in a relationship, it's reasonable to disengage. The key point is that the author isn't necessarily being inconsiderate; they're making a personal choice based on the other person's behavior, even if that behavior is something like social media posts.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not giving feedback is unfair. The guy might not realize his posts are offensive. But the author isn't obligated to explain themselves, especially if they don't want to engage further. It's about mutual respect and personal values. So, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to stop communication if they find the other person's content unacceptable. The answer is B.\n"
