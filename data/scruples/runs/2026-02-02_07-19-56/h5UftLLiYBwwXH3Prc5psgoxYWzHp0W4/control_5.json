I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of their social media posts. The person ghosted the guy without explaining why, and the guy is still trying to contact them. The reason given is that the guy's posts are immature and off-putting, like a meme about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and sleeping with friends' besties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the person justified it based on the content the guy posted. The posts do seem to reflect a certain attitude towards relationships and women, which the author found immature and gross. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. If the social media content is a valid reason for the author to disengage, then maybe they have a right to ghost. However, the issue is that ghosting is abrupt and can be hurtful. But if the author felt that engaging further would be problematic or uncomfortable, maybe they have a valid reason. The key points here are consent to be ghosted and the content of the posts. \n\nThe guy's posts could be seen as promoting casual relationships and maybe objectifying women, which the author finds unacceptable. The author might have felt that continuing the interaction would be supporting those views. However, they didn't communicate their reasons, which could lead to confusion for the other person.\n\nIn terms of societal standards, while ghosting isn't ideal, if the reason is based on personal boundaries and values, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to disengage from someone whose behavior or values clash with theirs. The problem is the lack of communication, but if the interaction was just starting and not in a committed relationship, maybe the author's action is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because they have a legitimate reason based on the guy's social media content, even though ghosting is generally considered rude. Their actions are a result of personal boundaries and finding the content unacceptable.\n"
