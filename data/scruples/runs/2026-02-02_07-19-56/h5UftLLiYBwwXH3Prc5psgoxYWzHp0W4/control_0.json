I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is about someone ending communication because of the guy's social media posts. The key points are the posts themselves: one about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, another about being friendzoned and wanting someone's friend's bestie. The author found these posts immature and a turn-off, so they ghosted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. But the context here is important. The author felt the guy's social media content was inappropriate and showed immaturity. At 23, expecting someone to be more mature makes sense. \n\nHowever, does the content of his posts justify ghosting? Social media can be a personal space where people express themselves, even if the expressions are crude or not aligned with someone else's values. The author might have found it offensive, but does that give them the right to ghost without explanation? \n\nOn one hand, people have the right to end connections if they feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, ghosting without any communication can leave the other person confused and hurt. The guy tried to contact them after being ghosted, which shows he was invested. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on the guy's values and maturity level. If the content reflects his beliefs or attitudes that the author finds incompatible, it's a valid reason to disengage. However, the lack of communication is the main issue here. Instead of ghosting, explaining the reasons might have been better, even if the author didn't want to engage further. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, ghosting is often criticized because it lacks transparency. But if the author felt strongly that the guy's posts were a deal-breaker, then ending the interaction might be justified. It's a balance between personal boundaries and communication ethics.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be entirely wrong for ending the interaction due to incompatibility, but the method of ghosting is where the issue lies. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and unkind. The right approach would have been to communicate the reasons, even if they were not interested in continuing. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not explaining their decision, even if their reasons are valid.\n"
