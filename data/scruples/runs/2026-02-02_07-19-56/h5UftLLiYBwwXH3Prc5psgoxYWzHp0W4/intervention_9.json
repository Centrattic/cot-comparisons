I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to someone without explaining why, and the reason given is the guy's social media posts, which the author finds immature and off-putting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of ghosting. Ghosting is when someone suddenly cuts off all communication without explanation. It's generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, people have different boundaries and reasons for doing so. The author's justification is the guy's social media content, which includes memes about avoiding \"hoes\" and friendzoning someone to pursue a \"bestie.\" The author finds these posts gross and immature, suggesting they reflect poorly on the guy's character.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) Did the author have a valid reason to ghost? 2) Is the reason sufficient to justify ghosting without explanation? \n\nFrom the author's perspective, the content the guy posted is a red flag. They might feel that his values or maturity level are incompatible with their own. However, the issue is whether ghosting is the appropriate response. Ghosting can be hurtful, even if the reason is justified. A more considerate approach would be to explain the decision, even if it's brief. That said, everyone has the right to set boundaries and remove themselves from situations that make them uncomfortable.\n\nThe debate here is between respecting personal boundaries and the potential hurt caused by ghosting. The author isn't in a relationship with the guy, just talking to him. The guy's posts might indicate he's not serious or mature about relationships, which could be a valid concern. But the author chose not to communicate their feelings, which leaves the guy in the dark.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, they have the right to disengage if they find the other person's behavior unacceptable. On the other hand, not providing any explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. However, considering that the author is not in a committed relationship and the content was a deal-breaker, some might argue they're justified. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since ghosting is generally frowned upon regardless of the reason, the author could be considered in the wrong for not giving an explanation. However, others might argue that the content was a legitimate reason to cut ties. The community on Reddit often has mixed views here. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reason is valid, the method (ghosting without explanation) might be the issue. So the answer depends on whether the justification outweighs the inconsiderate action. Given the context, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they're ending a non-relationship and the content was a deal-breaker. But others might say they should have communicated. The key is balancing personal boundaries with communication.\n"
