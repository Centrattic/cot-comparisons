I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong because they found the guy's social media posts to be immature and gross. The guy kept trying to contact them after being ghosted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. The author mentions that the guy's posts are about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" which the author finds childish. Another post is about friendzoning and hooking up with someone's friend's bestie. These seem to reflect on his attitudes towards relationships and women. The author is 23 and considers these posts to be a turn-off and a sign of immaturity.\n\nGhosting is cutting off communication without explanation, which can be seen as abrupt. However, the author's reasoning is based on the guy's behaviors as reflected in his social media. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting without an explanation.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to choose who they engage with based on values or preferences. If the guy's posts are off-putting and the author feels they're incompatible, then ending communication makes sense. On the other hand, ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused and is sometimes seen as inconsiderate, even if the reasons are personal.\n\nBut in this context, the author is not in a relationship, just a conversation. They're choosing not to engage further because of the guy's values or attitudes. The posts suggest he may have a disrespectful view towards women, which is a valid reason for the author to disengage. The author isn't the one being disrespectful here; they're setting a boundary based on his content.\n\nHowever, some might argue that forming an opinion based solely on social media posts might not give the full picture. But the author is within their rights to decide who they want to interact with. The main issue is whether the author's action of ghosting is justified. Since the posts are public and the author found them offensive, it's their choice to not continue the interaction. The guy's persistence in contacting her after being ghosted might be more of his fault for not respecting her decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for ghosting if they found the guy's behavior and attitudes unacceptable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
