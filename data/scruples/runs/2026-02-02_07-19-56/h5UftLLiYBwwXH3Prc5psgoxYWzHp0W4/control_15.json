I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted a guy because of his social media posts is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author stopped communicating with someone without explaining why, which is ghosting. The reason given is that the guy posted memes they found immature and offensive. The posts mentioned are about wanting a faithful girlfriend and a friendzoned joke about hooking up with a friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds these posts gross and a turn-off.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. However, the context here is important. The author felt that the guy's posts were inappropriate and a turn-off. The question is whether the ghosting was justified.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, ghosting is often frowned upon regardless of the reason. People usually expect some level of communication to end interactions respectfully. However, the author's reason is about personal boundaries and feeling uncomfortable with the content. They might feel that the guy's values or maturity level are incompatible with theirs.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might feel confused and hurt by being ghosted without an explanation. He might not have realized his posts were offensive to others. But the author's choice to distance themselves is based on their own standards.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author isn't \"wrong\" for finding the posts unacceptable, but the act of ghosting without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. However, given the content that was offensive to the author, it's a personal choice. The key points are about mutual respect and communication. The author might not be the asshole, but their method of ending the interaction could be improved. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
