I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explaining, and the guy keeps trying to contact them. The reason given is the guy's posts about relationships and maturity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation. However, the author's reasoning is that the guy's social media content shows immaturity and poor values. The posts mentioned are about avoiding \"hoes\" and friendzoning, which might indicate a lack of respect for others or unrealistic views on relationships.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author had a valid reason to ghost. While the content is questionable, the author didn't give the guy a chance to explain or change. Ghosting without any communication can be harsh, but if the posts genuinely made the author uncomfortable and they felt it was a deal-breaker, maybe it's understandable. The age mentioned is 23, so maybe expecting maturity isn't too much to ask, but people do have different levels of growth.\n\nHowever, the author's actions are ghosting, which is abrupt. The right approach would be to have an honest conversation. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, sometimes people have the right to disengage if they find someone's behavior off-putting. But ghosting without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that it's okay to remove oneself from situations that are toxic or immature. The author's reasons are valid to them, but the method of ghosting is the issue. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a legitimate reason, even though the method is questionable. But others might say they should have communicated better. Hmm.\n"
