I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who posted some memes and a picture that the author found immature and gross. The author decided to ghost him without explaining why.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author mentions the guy's social media posts. The memes are about wanting a faithful girlfriend and friendzoning, which the author thinks is immature. The author is 23, so maybe they have higher standards for maturity. But is it the author's right to ghost someone based on their social media content?\n\nGhosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation. However, the author might have valid reasons for feeling uncomfortable. The posts could indicate a lack of respect for relationships or others, which might be a red flag. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the guy's posts were offensive or made the author uncomfortable, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for distancing themselves. However, ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused and is considered disrespectful regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a reason to disengage. But the act of ghosting itself is still considered rude. However, in some contexts, people do choose to cut off contact if they find someone's behavior unacceptable, even if it's abrupt. The key is whether the author's actions were justified despite the method. \n\nIn online interactions, especially in the early stages of getting to know someone, people might set boundaries based on what they find offensive. The author's right to choose who they engage with might override the ghosting etiquette. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the method of cutting off communication is a point of contention. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because they had valid reasons to distance themselves.\n"
