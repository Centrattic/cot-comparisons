I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with someone after seeing his social media posts, which they found immature and off-putting. They ghosted him, and now he's trying to get in touch again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given for ghosting. The guy posted memes that the author found cringey and inappropriate. The memes reference things like \"running away from hoes\" and a picture about the friendzone. The author feels these are signs of immaturity and a turn-off, so they decided to stop interacting. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person in the dark without any explanation. However, people often ghost due to various reasons they find valid. The key here is whether the author had a justified reason. If the guy's social media content was making the author uncomfortable or clashed with their values, then maybe it's understandable. But the lack of communication is still a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy in question might not know why he was ghosted, which could lead to confusion and hurt feelings. The author could have explained their reasons if they felt comfortable, but they chose not to. So, the question is whether the author's actions were acceptable given their reasoning. \n\nI think the author might not be in the wrong because they had a legitimate reason to disengage. However, the method of disengagement (ghosting) is where the issue lies. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the primary reason for ghosting is based on the content they found off-putting, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, people do ghost others for reasons they consider personal and valid. The key is that the author felt the guy's behavior was incompatible with their own values. So, while the ghosting is rude, the underlying reason might justify it. However, if the author is being harsh without a valid reason, that's different. But given the examples, it's about the guy's social media posts being cringey and immature. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they had a reason, even if the method of ghosting is poor. The question is about the author's justification, not the method. So the answer is B.\n"
