I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy because of his social media posts. The guy in question posted some memes that the author found immature and offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the ghosting. The author didn't like the guy's posts, which included things like \"running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\" and another about friendzoning leading to sleeping with friends' best friends. These posts seem to express certain attitudes towards relationships and women, which the author finds gross and immature. The author is 23, so maybe they're looking for more mature interactions.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. However, the author's reasoning might be valid if the content of the guy's posts is a deal-breaker for them. People have the right to set boundaries in their relationships, and if someone's values or behaviors clash with their own, it's reasonable to distance themselves. The question is whether the author's actions are justified given the context.\n\nOn one hand, the guy might feel hurt or confused by the sudden ghosting. On the other, the author is protecting their own comfort and values. The key here is whether the author is being disrespectful by not explaining their decision. But since the author didn't engage in the conversation, maybe they felt it was unnecessary to explain. However, not communicating at all can be seen as inconsiderate regardless of the reason.\n\nI need to think about societal norms here. Ghosting is often frowned upon because it leaves the other person in limbo. But if the reason is based on personal values, some might support the author's choice. However, the author could have communicated their reasons instead of cutting off contact entirely. The problem is that ghosting is a form of emotional manipulation, even if the reason is valid. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not explaining their decision, even if the reason is justified.\n\nAlternatively, if the guy's posts are genuinely offensive and the author finds them unacceptable, it's their right to disengage. The issue is whether the author's action is proportionate. Ghosting is harsh, but if the author felt that engaging would be hypocritical or uncomfortable, maybe they had no choice. But typically, even if you don't want to continue a relationship, it's better to explain your reasons, even if it's brief.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reason might be valid, the act of ghosting is considered inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their reasons and simply cut off contact, which is generally seen as rude regardless of the justification.\n"
