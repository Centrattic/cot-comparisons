I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy without explaining why, and the guy keeps trying to contact them. The reason given is that the guy's posts are immature\u2014like a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about friendzoning and sleeping with friends' best friends. The author finds this gross and immature.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of ghosting. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. It's often seen as inconsiderate because the person being ghosted is left without closure. However, the context matters here. The author is justifying their actions based on the guy's social media content. \n\nThe guy's posts do reflect certain attitudes. The first meme uses derogatory language and implies a judgment of women, which is problematic. The second post is about friendzoning and then making a joke about sleeping with someone else, which could be seen as disrespectful towards relationships. The author is upset because these posts are immature and gross, and they want to avoid someone with such views.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for ghosting? Well, they had a reason, but the method was abrupt. However, social media behavior can reflect someone's values, and people have the right to disengage from interactions that make them uncomfortable. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified given the content. \n\nOn one hand, ghosting isn't kind, but on the other, the author is choosing to distance themselves from someone whose values they find off-putting. The question is whether the author's decision is fair. Since the posts in question are indeed problematic and reflect immaturity, the author's decision might be seen as valid, even if the ghosting was abrupt. \n\nThe guy is still trying to contact them, which could be annoying, but the author's right to disengage is their choice. The main issue is the ghosting without explanation. But given the context, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), because they have a reason to disengage, even if the method is harsh. The posts do show a lack of maturity, and the author is within their rights to decide not to engage further.\n"
