I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone based on their social media posts. So first, I need to understand the situation. The author ghosted a guy because of the memes and posts he put on social media. The guy keeps trying to contact them, and they feel like the content is immature and a turn-off.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for ghosting and whether that's justified. The posts in question are about avoiding \"hoes\" and friendzoning someone to be with their friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds this gross and immature. \n\nNow, considering if ghosting is appropriate here. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation. But the author's reason is based on the person's values or behavior. The posts suggest the guy has a certain attitude towards relationships, maybe objectifying others or being disrespectful. If the author finds that incompatible with their values, then maybe it's okay. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, sometimes people have different opinions on what's acceptable. The author might have a right to disengage if they feel the person isn't a good match. However, ghosting can be hurtful. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just whether the action is kind. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. If the author has valid reasons based on the person's behavior, even if it's not a romantic relationship yet, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if the content of the posts is actually problematic. The meme about \"running away from hoes\" could be seen as objectifying women, which is disrespectful. The other post about \"friendzone me then fuck your other friend's bestie\" is also problematic. So the author has grounds to be put off. Therefore, their decision to ghost is justified, so not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
