I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone based on their social media posts. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author ghosted a guy because of the stuff he posts online. The guy in question posted memes that seem to promote shallow or disrespectful views towards women. The author found that immature and a turn-off, so they decided to cut contact without explaining.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. However, the reason for ghosting matters. If the content the guy posted is offensive or disrespectful, the author might have valid reasons. But is it okay to ghost without explaining? \n\nThe key points are the content of his posts. The meme about \"running away from hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend\" could be seen as objectifying women. The other post about \"friendzone\" and \"fuck your other friends bestie\" is even more problematic. These posts might indicate a lack of respect for women, which could be a red flag in a potential relationship. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that this immaturity is a turn-off. They are prioritizing their values and comfort in a relationship. While ghosting isn't ideal, the context of the posts might justify the decision. However, some might argue that not communicating the reason is still inconsiderate. \n\nBut considering the content, maybe the author is protecting themselves from someone with harmful views. So, while the method (ghosting) is harsh, the reason could be valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for acting on their own comfort and values. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to disengage from interactions that make them uncomfortable, especially if the other person's behavior is off-putting or harmful. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is setting boundaries based on the guy's inappropriate content. However, the lack of communication is a negative aspect. But given the context, the justification might outweigh that. \n\nI think the consensus here would be that the author isn't in the wrong because the content is indeed problematic and the ghosting is a way to avoid engaging with someone who has questionable values. So the answer is B.\n"
