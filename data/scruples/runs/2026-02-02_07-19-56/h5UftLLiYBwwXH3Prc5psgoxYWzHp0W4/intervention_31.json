I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they ghosted a guy because of his social media posts. The guy keeps trying to contact them, and the reason given is that the guy's posts are immature and gross. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it's cutting off communication without explanation. However, the author had a specific reason: the guy's social media content. The posts mentioned are about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting to \"fuck your other friends' bestie,\" which the author finds immature and off-putting. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. The guy's posts might indicate a certain attitude that the author finds incompatible. But does that justify ghosting without explanation? People have different standards, and while the guy's posts are cringey, it's his personal expression. The author might have a right to disengage if they find his behavior objectionable. \n\nHowever, ghosting without any explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt. The author could have addressed the issue by having a conversation or explaining their reasons. But since they didn't, some might argue they're in the wrong for being abrupt. On the other hand, if the content made them uncomfortable, they're not obligated to continue the interaction. \n\nI need to weigh the immaturity of the posts against the rudeness of ghosting. The author's age is 23, so maybe they're more sensitive to such content. The other person's posts might reflect a lack of self-awareness, but that doesn't automatically make the author right to ghost. It's a bit of a toss-up. Some people might say the author is justified in setting boundaries, while others might say they should have communicated better. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both parties' actions. If the guy's posts were offensive, the author isn't wrong to disengage. But the ghosting is the issue here. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author had a valid reason to step back, even if the method was abrupt. Alternatively, A if the method was too harsh. \n\nI think leaning towards B makes sense because the author is not responsible for the other person's behavior. They have the right to end the interaction if it's making them uncomfortable. Ghosting isn't ideal, but the root issue isn't their fault. So the answer is B.\n"
