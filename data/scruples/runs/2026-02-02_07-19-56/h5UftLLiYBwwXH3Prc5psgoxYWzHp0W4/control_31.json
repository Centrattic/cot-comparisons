I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without telling him why because of his social media posts. The guy is trying to contact them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. The author found the guy's posts to be immature and off-putting, like the memes about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting to sleep with someone's friend's bestie. These posts might indicate a lack of maturity or respect for others, which could be a valid concern. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it doesn't give the other person a chance to respond or understand. However, the author might feel that the content the guy posted reflects his values or attitude, which are incompatible. At 23, people might still be figuring things out, but the posts do seem a bit crass.\n\nThe key points are: the reasons for ghosting are based on the guy's behavior and values, but the method of cutting off communication is abrupt. However, since the author is not in a relationship and is ending a casual conversation, maybe it's more about personal boundaries. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they felt the guy's attitude was unappealing. So the answer might be B, but need to weigh the ghosting against the reasons.\n"
