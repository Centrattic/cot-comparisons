I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explaining, and the reason is the guy's social media posts which the author finds immature and gross. The guy is trying to contact them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting someone can be seen as inconsiderate, but the reason here is based on the guy's online behavior. The posts mentioned are about running away from women and friendzoning, which the author finds disrespectful. The author is 23, so maybe they have certain expectations about maturity in relationships.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author act wrong by ghosting? Well, people have different boundaries. If the guy's posts are offensive or disrespectful, the author might feel justified in cutting off communication. However, not explaining could leave the guy confused. But is that the author's fault? If the reason is about personal values and the content is indeed inappropriate, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for ending the interaction. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that ghosting is rude regardless of the reason. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author had valid concerns about the guy's behavior, even if the method of cutting off contact wasn't ideal, the reasoning might be justifiable. So the answer would lean towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they had a valid reason based on the guy's disrespectful posts. The act of ghosting is inconsiderate, but the underlying cause supports the decision.\n"
