I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone for their social media posts is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author stopped communicating with a guy because of the memes he posted, which the author finds immature and off-putting. The guy keeps trying to contact them, but the author didn't explain why they ghosted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of ghosting. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. The author did that, which can be seen as rude, but the reason matters here. The guy's posts are about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" which the author finds gross. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for doing this.\n\nThe key points are the content of the guy's social media. The memes suggest he's making light of objectifying women or having double standards in relationships. The author is 23, so maybe they're looking for more maturity. But the author didn't explain why they stopped talking, leading to confusion on the guy's end.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Ghosting without explanation is usually frowned upon because it leaves the other person in the dark. However, the reason for ghosting could mitigate that. If the guy's content is offensive or harmful, the author might feel justified. But the author's judgment is based on social media posts, not the guy's actual behavior. Also, the guy might not realize how his posts come across.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to disengage from someone whose views they find objectionable. On the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful and lacks communication. But the author's reasoning is about the guy's attitudes, which are important in forming a relationship. If the guy's values conflict with the author's, it's reasonable to walk away. However, the lack of communication is a point against the author.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reason is valid enough to justify ghosting. The community often weighs the reason against the action. In many AITA cases, the reason matters. If the guy's posts are genuinely offensive, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting distance. But the ghosting method is still considered poor form. However, in this case, maybe the author isn't the asshole because they have a legitimate reason, even if the delivery was abrupt.\n"
