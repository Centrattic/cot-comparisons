I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explaining why, and the guy keeps trying to contact them. The reason given is that the guy's social media content is immature and offensive, like memes about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting to sleep with a friend's ex's best friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation, which can leave the other person confused and hurt. But the author has a reason: the guy's posts are offensive. The content he posted is about wanting a faithful girlfriend but also making jokes about sleeping with someone else's friend's ex's bestie. That seems contradictory and maybe disrespectful. The author, being 23, might find this immaturity a deal-breaker.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but if the content is genuinely offensive, maybe the author has justification. The key point is whether the author's reason is valid enough to overlook the ghosting. The posts seem to promote or make light of things that could be considered disrespectful towards women or relationships. If the author felt uncomfortable or found it gross, it's their right to disengage. However, the method of ghosting without explanation is still rude. But maybe the content was a valid reason for wanting no further contact. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the reason is justified, even though the method isn't ideal. However, some might argue that ghosting is always wrong regardless of the reason. But given the offensive content, the author might have a valid reason to cut contact. So, leaning towards B.\n"
