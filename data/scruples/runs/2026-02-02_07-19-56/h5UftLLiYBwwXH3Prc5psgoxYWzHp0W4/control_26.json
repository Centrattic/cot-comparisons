I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for ghosting a guy because of his social media posts. The author ghosted him after seeing memes that seemed immature and objectifying women. The guy in question is 23, and the author found his posts to be unappealing and not something they'd want in a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you're cutting off communication without explanation. However, some people might justify it if they find something offensive or if they're not interested in continuing the interaction.\n\nThe key points here are the content of the social media posts. The guy posted things like \"running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\" and \"if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie.\" These posts are problematic because they use derogatory terms (\"hoes\") and suggest using others for sexual purposes, which can be seen as disrespectful towards women. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that these posts are immature and a turn-off, and they believe people like that should be avoided. From a moral standpoint, the author might feel it's justified to distance themselves from someone who expresses such views. However, the issue with ghosting is that it's abrupt and doesn't allow the other person an opportunity to explain or change.\n\nBut considering the content of the posts, one could argue that the author is making a judgment based on the person's expressed values, which is a valid reason to end an interaction. The problem might be whether the author had already established a relationship where an explanation was necessary. If they were just starting to talk and the author felt uncomfortable based on social media, ghosting might be seen as a way to avoid confrontation, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the dilemma here is between respecting the other person's right to express their views (even if they're offensive) and the author's right to disengage from someone whose values conflict with theirs. The author isn't in the wrong for disengaging, but ghosting without explanation might be seen as inconsiderate. However, given the offensive nature of the posts, the author's decision could be justified as self-respect and avoiding toxic relationships.\n"
