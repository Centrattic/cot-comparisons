I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without telling him why, mainly because of his social media posts. The guy keeps trying to contact her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author found the guy's social media content immature and off-putting. The posts mentioned are about avoiding \"hoes\" and a friendzone meme. She's 23 and thinks it's gross and immature. \n\nGhosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and doesn't give the other person closure. However, people have reasons for ending communication. The key here is whether her actions were justified. If the posts made her uncomfortable and she felt they were incompatible, maybe it's understandable. But is she in the wrong for not explaining?\n\nThe guy is persistent, trying to contact her. She might feel that explaining would lead to more issues, but ghosting is still the issue. On the other hand, if his posts were red flags she didn't want to deal with, her decision is valid. However, the act of ghosting without any explanation is what's being questioned. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong for ending communication, but the method (ghosting) is where the problem lies. However, the question is whether she is the asshole (AITA). If her reasoning is based on his behavior being a dealbreaker, then she's not wrong. But maybe she should have communicated her reasons. \n\nBut the options are A for yes (she's wrong) and B for no (she's not). Considering the context, her reasons are personal and she's within her right to stop talking if his posts were a turn-off. The fact that she's 23 and values maturity is her personal preference. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
