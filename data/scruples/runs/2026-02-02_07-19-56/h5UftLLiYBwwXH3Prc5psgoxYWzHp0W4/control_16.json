I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The author of the post ghosted a guy because of his social media posts, which they found immature and off-putting. The guy keeps trying to contact them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. The author didn't like the guy's posts about relationships and maturity. They mention wanting a \"nice, faithful girlfriend\" in a meme and a friendzone joke. The author found these things gross and immature. So, they cut off communication without explaining.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person without closure. However, if the author had clear reasons for ending the interaction, maybe it's justified. The key points here are the content of the posts. The guy's posts might indicate immaturity in handling relationships, which the author reasonably found unattractive.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the posts were annoying, the author could have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting. Ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason. But if the author felt that the guy's behavior was inappropriate and they didn't want to engage further, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that ghosting lacks communication, but the reason is based on the guy's posts, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, since the author had valid reasons based on the guy's behavior, the answer might lean towards B. But I should check if the act of ghosting is inherently wrong regardless of the reason. Some might argue that even if someone is toxic, you shouldn't ghost them. Others might say you have the right to disengage without explanation.\n\nIn this case, the author didn't like the guy's posts, which they found immature. Ghosting is the choice made, which is rude, but the underlying reason might be justified. The answer depends on whether the act of ghosting is wrong regardless of the reason. If the community values communication over ghosting, then A. If they believe the author had a valid reason, then B.\n\nI think in AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often considers both the action and the reason. If the reason is valid, they might excuse the action. So the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The ghosting is rude, but the reason is a legitimate deal-breaker. The guy's posts indicate immaturity, so the author is justified in ending the interaction, even if they didn't explain.\n"
