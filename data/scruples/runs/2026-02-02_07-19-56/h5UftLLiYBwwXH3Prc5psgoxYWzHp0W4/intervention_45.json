I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for ghosting someone based on their social media posts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author ghosted a guy without explaining why, and the reason given is that the guy's social media posts are immature. Examples include a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and a picture referencing the friendzone and wanting to \"fuck your other friends bestie.\" The author is 23 and finds these posts gross, so they decided to cut contact.\n\nNow, considering ghosting, which is cutting off communication without explanation. The question is whether that's wrong. Ghosting can be seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, there are arguments where ghosting is justified, like if the person is toxic or the relationship is unhealthy. \n\nIn this case, the author is not in a committed relationship but was talking to the guy. The social media posts are deemed immature and off-putting. The author might feel that continuing the conversation would lead to discomfort or that the guy isn't someone they want to engage with. However, the act of ghosting without any explanation could be hurtful, even if the decision is based on personal values or preferences.\n\nBut social media content is public, and people have different thresholds for what they find acceptable. The author is within their right to disengage if they find the content offensive or immature. However, the lack of communication might be considered inconsiderate, even if the reasoning is valid. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If we consider that ghosting is generally seen as poor communication, then maybe A (Yes). But if the reasoning is based on the other person's behavior (even if it's just social media posts), then B (No) could be the case. \n\nBut wait, social media posts are part of someone's public persona. The author might have a right to disengage if those posts are off-putting. However, the lack of feedback could prevent the other person from understanding why their behavior is problematic. \n\nAlso, at 23, the author is mature and can make such a judgment. The posts are indeed cringe and could be seen as disrespectful. So maybe the author's decision is justified, but the method (ghosting without explanation) is inconsiderate. So the answer might depend on whether the wrong is in the ghosting act or the reasoning. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's reasoning is based on the guy's content, which is public and potentially offensive, the author isn't wrong for disengaging. However, the ghosting part is the issue. So the answer is A (Yes) because ghosting is rude, but the reasoning is valid. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the decision is justified but the method isn't, is the author in the wrong? \n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, people often expect some level of communication. Ghosting is usually seen as the asshole move, even if the reason is valid. So the author is in the wrong for ghosting without an explanation. The answer would be A.\n"
