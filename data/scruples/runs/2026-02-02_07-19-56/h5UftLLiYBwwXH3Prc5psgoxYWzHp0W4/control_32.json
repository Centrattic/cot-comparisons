I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to someone because of his social media posts, which they found immature and off-putting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The guy posted memes that the author found disrespectful, like one about \"running away from hoes\" and another about the friendzone and sleeping with others' friends' besties. The author is 23 and finds these posts gross and immature.\n\nGhosting is generally when you cut off communication without explanation. The question is whether the author's reason justifies ghosting. The key points here are the content of the posts and the appropriateness of the response.\n\nThe guy's posts could be seen as promoting casual relationships or maybe even objectifying others. If the author finds that incompatible with their values, it's understandable they want no part in a relationship with someone who holds such views. However, ghosting without any explanation might be considered harsh, even if the reason is valid. But the alternative is to explain and potentially get into a conflict or have the guy not take it seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to explain their reasons if they don't want to. They have the right to set boundaries and disengage if they feel the person's behavior is not aligned with their standards. The posts in question might indicate a lack of respect for others, which is a legitimate concern when considering a relationship.\n\nSo, while ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate, in this case, the author's reason is about personal values and safety. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting themselves from someone with potentially toxic views. However, some might argue that even if the posts are bad, ghosting is still a poor choice. But given the context, the author's actions are more about self-respect and avoiding a problematic relationship.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason for cutting off communication based on the person's values, even if the method was abrupt.\n"
