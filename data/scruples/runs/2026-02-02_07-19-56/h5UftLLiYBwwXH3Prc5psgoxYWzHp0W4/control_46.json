I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who ghosted is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy after seeing his social media posts. The guy posted a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another about the friendzone and hooking up with friends' besties. The author is 23 and finds these posts immature and a turn off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author didn't provide an explanation for ghosting, which can be hurtful. But the content of the posts might be the issue here. The guy's social media posts seem to promote or joke about behaviors that are manipulative or disrespectful towards women. The author is justified in finding that off-putting, especially if it's a dealbreaker for them.\n\nHowever, ghosting without any communication can be seen as inconsiderate. The guy is trying to contact her, and cutting off all communication without an explanation might be harsh. But the alternative is to have a conversation, which the author didn't do. So, the conflict here is between the author's right to disengage based on personal values and the method they used (ghosting) which can be considered rude.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and social expectations. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, if the posts are genuinely offensive or troubling, the author has a right to distance themselves. The key is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to something they found unacceptable. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on balancing the inconsiderate act of ghosting against the validity of their reasons. If the posts are truly problematic, the author's decision is understandable. However, the lack of communication is a point against them. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to explain their disinterest if it's related to the other person's behavior. But in this case, the author might feel that engaging further would lead to conflict or discomfort. The problem is that ghosting doesn't address the behavior, which the author finds unacceptable. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the content of the posts is a legitimate concern. However, the method of disengagement is less than ideal. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just the method. Since the author's reasons are valid, the answer would lean towards them not being the asshole. So, answer B.\n"
