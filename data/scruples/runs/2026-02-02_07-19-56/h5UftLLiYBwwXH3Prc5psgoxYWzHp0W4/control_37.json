I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone for their social media posts is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author stopped communicating (ghosted) a guy because of his social media content. The guy in question posted some memes that the author found immature and unattractive. The author is 23, and they think such behavior is a red flag.\n\nSo, the key points here are the reasons for ghosting. The author didn't give a direct reason, just ghosted. The guy is trying to reach out again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have the right to end a conversation or a potential relationship if they feel uncomfortable. However, ghosting without explanation can be seen as rude, even if the reasons are personal. But in this case, the author has valid reasons based on the guy's posts. The memes suggest a lack of maturity and possibly disrespectful attitudes towards relationships and others, which are legitimate concerns. The author is not obligated to engage with someone whose values or attitudes they find off-putting.\n\nHowever, the act of ghosting without any communication might be seen as a poor way to handle the situation. Some might argue that even if the reason is valid, being direct and explaining the decision could be more respectful. But others would say that the author has the right to disengage without justification, especially if the content is a deal-breaker for them.\n\nThe community's perspective on such situations often leans towards not judging the person who ends the interaction for personal reasons, especially when those reasons relate to values or respect. The guy's posts could be seen as inappropriate or showing a lack of respect, which is a valid reason to step back.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't wrong for finding the guy's posts unacceptable and choosing not to continue the interaction. While ghosting isn't the most communicative approach, the reasons given are legitimate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
