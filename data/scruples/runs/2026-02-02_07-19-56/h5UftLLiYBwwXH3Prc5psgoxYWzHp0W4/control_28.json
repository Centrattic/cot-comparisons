I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy because of his social media posts. The guy's posts include a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another image about the friendzone and sleeping with a friend's bestie. The author is 23, and they think the guy is immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because the person is left without an explanation. However, sometimes people do it to avoid hurt feelings. The question is whether the author's reason justifies it.\n\nThe guy's posts do seem problematic. The first meme uses a derogatory term (\"hoes\") and the second one makes a joke about the friendzone and sleeping with someone's friend's bestie. These could indicate a lack of respect for others, or maybe a tendency to objectify people. The author might find these attitudes incompatible with their values, especially if they're looking for a serious relationship.\n\nBut is it wrong to ghost? The author didn't explain why they stopped communication, which is a common criticism of ghosting. However, the content of the posts might be a legitimate reason to walk away. The user is trying to assess if their reaction is justified.\n\nAlso, considering their age (23), both might still be figuring things out, but the author's reaction is about maturity. They might feel that the guy's posts show a lack of growth, which is a valid concern. However, the guy might not see his posts as offensive, or he might not realize how they come across.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have had an open conversation to address the issues instead of ghosting. That might have been more respectful. However, the decision to ghost might be seen as self-preservation if the author felt uncomfortable or disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the ghosting was due to valid personal boundaries and values, maybe not. But the lack of communication is a point against them. The answer hinges on whether the reason for ghosting is justified enough to overlook the inconsiderate act of not explaining.\n"
