I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted a guy based on his social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with the guy without explaining why, and the reason given is the guy's posts like a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another post about friendzoning and hooking up with a friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds this immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if ghosting is justified here. Ghosting means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. In some cases, people might do this if they feel uncomfortable or if the other person's behavior is red flags. The guy's posts seem to promote or joke about things like objectifying women, double standards in relationships, and maybe even non-consensual situations (like hooking up with a friend's bestie without consent). These could be deal-breakers for someone looking for a mature, respectful partner.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the content of the guy's social media. They found it immature and inappropriate, which is a personal judgment. However, if the posts reflect the guy's actual values or behavior, then the author is making a valid choice to avoid a potential toxic relationship. Social media posts can be a window into someone's character, so using that as a basis for decision-making is not unusual.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that ghosting is inconsiderate regardless of the reason. The guy might not have known his posts were offensive, and the author could have addressed it directly. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the posts are indeed concerning and the author felt they were incompatible, then ghosting might be a way to protect themselves from a potentially harmful relationship. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author overreacted. The meme about wanting a faithful girlfriend could be seen as just a joke. But the other post about friendzoning and hooking up with a friend's bestie is more problematic, as it might suggest a lack of respect for others' relationships. If the author found these values conflicting with their own, it's reasonable to step back.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had a reason based on the guy's behavior as shown through his posts. The key is whether the posts indicate something that would make a healthy relationship impossible. If so, then the author's choice to ghost is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
