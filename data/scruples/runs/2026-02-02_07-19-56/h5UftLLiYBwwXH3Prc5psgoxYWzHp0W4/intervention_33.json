I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong for ghosting a guy because of his social media posts. The author says they stopped talking to him without explanation because the guy posted things they found immature and offensive. The guy is trying to contact them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting can be seen as rude because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. But the author's reasoning is based on the content of the guy's social media posts, which they find inappropriate. The posts include things about avoiding \"hoes\" and friendzoning with a humorous but potentially offensive angle. \n\nThe key points are: the author's decision is based on the guy's public content, which they consider unappealing or immature. The author is 23 and values maturity. The guy's posts might reflect his attitude towards relationships, which the author finds off-putting. \n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to set their boundaries and choose who they want to interact with. If the guy's values or attitudes clash with the author's, it's reasonable to disengage. On the other hand, ghosting without explanation can be hurtful and disrespectful. The author didn't give a reason, which might make it seem abrupt.\n\nBut in this case, the author isn't in a relationship with the guy; they were just talking. So, maybe ghosting is acceptable here since it's not a committed relationship. Also, the author's reasons are personal preferences about the guy's character as shown through his posts. The question is whether those reasons justify ghosting. \n\nSome might argue that the author is within their rights to stop communicating if the guy's values are a deal-breaker. Others might say that even in casual interactions, being upfront is better. However, since the author didn't know the guy well enough to confront him, ghosting might be a way to avoid confrontation. \n\nThe posts mentioned are examples of the guy's beliefs, which the author finds gross and immature. If the author wants to avoid people with such views, it's their choice. So, the action is a personal decision based on their standards. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to engage with someone whose values they don't respect.\n"
