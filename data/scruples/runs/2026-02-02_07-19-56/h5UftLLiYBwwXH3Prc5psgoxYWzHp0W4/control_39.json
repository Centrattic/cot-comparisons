I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the author ghosted the guy without explaining. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. But the reason given is the guy's social media content. The posts mentioned are about running from \"hoes\" and wanting to friendzone someone to sleep with their friend's bestie. Those seem immature and possibly objectifying women, which the author finds off-putting.\n\nThe author is 23, so maybe they're in a phase where they're more conscious about maturity and respect in relationships. The guy's posts could be seen as disrespectful towards women, which is a valid concern. The author might have felt that the guy's attitudes are not compatible with their values, leading them to cut contact.\n\nBut ghosting without explanation is abrupt. A better approach might have been to explain the issues if they wanted to end the conversation. However, the author's reasoning is based on the guy's public behavior, which they find gross and immature. If the author isn't interested in someone who holds those views, it's their right to disengage. \n\nSo, while ghosting isn't ideal, the justification here is about values. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a judgment based on the person's character as reflected in their posts. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful. Since they didn't explain, it's a bit harsh, but the reasoning is valid. So, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
