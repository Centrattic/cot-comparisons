I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author stopped communicating with a guy they were talking to, without explaining why. The guy keeps trying to contact them. The reason given is the guy's social media posts, which they found immature and off-putting. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation. But the author has a reason\u2014social media content they find inappropriate. The posts mentioned are about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting to be friendzoned while helping to sleep with someone's friend's bestie. At 23, the author finds this maturity and a turn-off. \n\nSo, is it okay to ghost based on someone's social media? Well, people have the right to set boundaries in relationships. If the content is something the author finds incompatible with their values, they might feel justified in ending the interaction. However, ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason. The author didn't explain their decision, which could leave the other person confused or hurt.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they have the right to disengage if they find the person's behavior unacceptable. On the other hand, cutting off communication without any explanation is considered inconsiderate. There's no right or wrong answer here, but it's about perspective. The author's reason is valid, but the method (ghosting) is not. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because their reason is based on personal boundaries, but the method is questionable. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and they did ghost, but their reason is justified, perhaps the answer is B. Alternatively, some might argue that ghosting is always inconsiderate, making the author at least partially wrong. But given the context, the author's reasoning is understandable. So leaning towards B.\n"
