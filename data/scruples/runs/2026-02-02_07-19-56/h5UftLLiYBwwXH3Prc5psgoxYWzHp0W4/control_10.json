I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy because of his social media posts. The guy keeps trying to contact them, and they ghosted without explaining. The posts mentioned are about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, which the author finds immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether ghosting is justified here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. However, the author has a reason\u2014social media content they find off-putting. The question is whether that reason is valid enough to justify ghosting.\n\nThe guy's posts: one meme says \"running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend.\" Another says \"if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie.\" These seem to indicate that he has a certain attitude towards relationships and women. The author finds this immature and a turn-off. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they value maturity and respect in potential partners. They might feel that the guy's posts show a lack of respect or a superficial view of relationships. However, the guy might not see his posts as problematic. The author's decision to ghost is based on their own standards and what they find acceptable.\n\nNow, is ghosting wrong in this case? Well, even if the author has a reason, cutting off communication without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt. The author could have addressed the issue directly, explaining their discomfort with his posts. But they chose to ghost instead. \n\nBut maybe the author felt that discussing it would be pointless, especially if they were only in the early stages of talking. If they weren't in a serious relationship, ghosting might be a way to end things without engaging further. However, the guy is trying to contact them again, and the author is avoiding it. \n\nThe key points here are the justification for ghosting and the appropriateness of the action. The author believes the guy's behavior is inappropriate, so they have a reason. But the method of ending communication is abrupt. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's actions are a personal choice based on their values. The guy's posts might be seen as problematic by some, so the author isn't entirely wrong to disengage. However, the lack of communication could still be seen as rude. \n\nBut considering the content of his posts, which some might view as disrespectful or immature, the author's reaction is understandable. They're protecting their own values and avoiding someone who might not align with their standards. \n\nSo, while ghosting isn't ideal, the author's reasons might be valid enough to justify their actions. Therefore, they might not be the asshole here.\n"
