I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to someone because of his social media posts. The guy posted some memes about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and sleeping with a friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds this immature.\n\nHmm, the first thing I need to consider is whether the author had a valid reason to ghost. The guy's posts seem to have some problematic content. The meme about \"running away from hoes\" could be seen as misogynistic, and the other one implies he wants to sleep with someone's friend's bestie, which is not respectful. So maybe the author's reason is valid.\n\nBut then, ghosting without explanation can be hurtful. However, the author might not want to engage with someone whose values they find offensive. The key here is that the author is setting a boundary based on the guy's behavior, even if that behavior is on social media. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to explain their reasons? Well, ghosting without any communication can leave the other person confused. But if the content is offensive and the author finds it a deal-breaker, they might feel it's not worth the conversation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're choosing to disengage from someone whose posts they find objectionable. It's a personal choice, and while ghosting isn't ideal, the reason is valid. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
