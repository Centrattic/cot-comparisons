I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong for ghosting someone based on their social media posts. The author explains that they stopped talking to this guy without telling him why, and the reason is the guy's social media content, which they find immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. However, the author's reasoning is based on the guy's social media posts, which they find off-putting. The posts mentioned include a meme about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another about being friendzoned and then approaching someone else's friend's bestie. These posts seem to reflect certain attitudes towards relationships and social interactions.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. One perspective is that the author has the right to disengage if the person's values or behavior don't align with their own preferences. If the guy's posts are a red flag for the author, they aren't obligated to continue the interaction. However, ghosting without any explanation can be hurtful, even if the reasoning is valid. The other person might feel confused or rejected without understanding the cause.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is justified in setting boundaries and prioritizing their own comfort. If the guy's posts indicate a lack of maturity or respectful views on relationships, the author is within their rights to cut ties. The key point is whether the author's actions were respectful and considerate. Ghosting isn't the kindest approach, but it's not necessarily wrong if the person feels their time and energy are better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn the original post, the author mentions that they think guys with such attitudes should be avoided. This suggests that their decision is based on personal values. While the method of communication (ghosting) is questionable, the underlying reason might be valid. So, the answer might hinge on whether the fault lies in the ghosting itself or the justification for it.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I should consider both sides. The main issue is that ghosting is abrupt, but the motivation is about personal boundaries. In many cases, people choose to ghost when they feel the conversation or relationship is headed in an undesirable direction. However, communication is generally preferred. Yet, the author might not feel comfortable explaining their reasons, especially if they find the content offensive. \n\nGiven that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to end communication if the other person's behavior is a deal-breaker. The problem is more about the lack of closure rather than the decision itself. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they are setting boundaries based on personal values, even if the method of communication could be improved.\n"
