I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of their social media posts. The author mentions that the guy posted some memes about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another about the friendzone and hooking up with friends' best friends. The author found these posts immature and a turn-off, so they ghosted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation. But the author has a reason here. The guy's social media content seems to promote double standards and maybe even disrespectful attitudes towards women. The author is 23, and they found this behavior unacceptable. \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't communicate their feelings directly, which is a problem because ghosting can leave the other person confused. On the other hand, the content the guy posted does reflect a certain mindset that the author rightly finds off-putting. The author's decision is based on personal values and what they find respectful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, while ghosting isn't ideal, the reason behind it is valid. The author is choosing to distance themselves from someone whose views they disagree with. They have the right to prioritize their comfort and values. However, the method could be improved by a direct communication. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since their actions stem from a justified reason, even if the approach isn't perfect, maybe they're not in the wrong. So I think the answer is B (No).\n"
