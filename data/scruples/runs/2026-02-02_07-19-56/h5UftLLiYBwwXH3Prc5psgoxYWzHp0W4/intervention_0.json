I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy because of his social media posts. The guy posted memes about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another about being friendzoned but wanting to sleep with a friend's bestie. The author is 23 and finds this immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you don't give a reason or closure. But the author has a specific reason here\u2014social media content that they find offensive. The posts suggest the guy has immature or disrespectful views towards women, which could be a valid concern for someone looking for a mature relationship.\n\nIs the author justified in their reaction? If the guy's posts reflect his values, and the author finds those values incompatible with their own, then walking away makes sense. However, the method of ending communication (ghosting) without explanation is where it gets tricky. The author could have addressed the issue directly instead of cutting off contact abruptly.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014being in the early stages of talking to someone, maybe not a deep relationship yet\u2014ghosting might be a way to avoid confrontation. The author's concern about the guy's maturity is valid. The question is whether the content of his posts is a legitimate reason to cut ties. If the author values maturity and respect, then their reaction is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, is the author being too quick to judge based on social media? Maybe the guy's posts are just for humor or don't reflect his true beliefs. The author didn't explain their reasons, which leaves the other person confused. But in terms of being in the wrong, if the author's decision is based on their own values and they're not harming him directly, maybe they're not wrong for choosing to stop interacting.\n\nThe key points are: the author's action was ghosting, which is generally frowned upon, but their reasoning is about shared values and respect. The answer hinges on whether the reason justifies the method. Even if the reason is valid, not giving an explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. However, given the content of the posts, the author might believe that engaging further would be problematic. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their decision is based on personal values related to the guy's maturity and respect for women. Ghosting is still rude, but the underlying reason might mitigate that. So the answer is B.\n"
