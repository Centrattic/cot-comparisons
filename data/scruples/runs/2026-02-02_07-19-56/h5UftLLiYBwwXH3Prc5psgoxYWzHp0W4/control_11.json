I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that they stopped talking to a guy without telling him why, and the reason was his social media posts. The guy in question posted some memes about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a nice, faithful girlfriend, and another about the friendzone and trying to date a friend's bestie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author ghosted him, which means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the reason given here is about the guy's social media content, which the author finds immature and off-putting.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The author stopped communicating without telling the guy why. Ghosting is often frowned upon because it's disrespectful and lacks communication.\n2. The reason for ghosting is based on the guy's online behavior. The posts mentioned could be seen as objectifying women or having double standards, which might be valid concerns for the author.\n3. The guy is still trying to contact her, which complicates things. The author might feel that explaining would lead to more issues or that the guy isn't worth the explanation.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting itself is typically considered rude regardless of the reason. Even if someone's behavior is problematic, cutting them off without explanation can be hurtful. However, the author might have valid reasons for finding his posts inappropriate. That said, the appropriate response would be to communicate the issue directly rather than ghosting. So while the author has a reason, the method of cutting off communication is inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting is disrespectful, despite the reason. However, if the reason is valid, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the other person. Since the act of ghosting is inconsiderate, the author is at fault for the method, even if the reason is understandable. So the answer is A.\n"
