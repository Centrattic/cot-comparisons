I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was talking to a guy but decided to ghost him because of his social media posts. The guy keeps trying to contact her. The posts mentioned are a meme about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice faithful girlfriend,\" and another picture with a friendzone joke. The author finds these immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why the author ghosted him. They didn't like his social media content. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation. But in this case, the author has reasons they consider valid. The social media posts might reflect the guy's values or maturity level, which the author finds unappealing. \n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is often frowned upon because it can be hurtful, but if the reasons are personal and valid to the person, maybe it's justified. The author's reasoning is about the guy's maturity and their own standards. The posts mentioned could indicate a lack of seriousness or respect, which the author values. \n\nHowever, should the author have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting? The guy might have been unaware of his posts being an issue. But the author might feel that his social media is public and they have the right to disengage if it's a deal-breaker. \n\nThe key points are the validity of the author's reasons and the method of cutting off communication. Since the posts are public, the author has the right to avoid someone based on those. However, ghosting without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. But if the author found his behavior gross and immature, perhaps it's a personal choice and not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author's reasons are their own standards, and while ghosting isn't ideal, it's not necessarily wrong if they found his content unacceptable. The line between immaturity and adult content might be subjective, but the author has the right to choose who they interact with.\n"
