I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of their social media posts. The author stopped talking to a guy without explaining why, and the guy is still trying to contact him. The reason given is that the guy's posts are immature and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off all communication without explanation. The author did that, which can be rude, but sometimes people do it for various reasons. The key here is the justification provided. The author found the guy's social media content unacceptable\u2014specifically, memes about running away from \"hoes\" and wanting to sleep with a friend's bestie if friend-zoned. These posts are seen as immature and unfaithful, which the author finds off-putting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a personal choice standpoint, the author isn't obligated to explain their actions or continue a conversation if they're uncomfortable. However, ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused. But the content in question does raise red flags about the guy's values and maturity. The author is making a judgment based on those posts, which is a valid personal choice.\n\nIs it fair to ghost over social media content? Well, people have different boundaries. If someone's values clash with yours, it's reasonable to disengage. The author isn't in a relationship, so they aren't breaking any commitments. The main issue is the lack of explanation, but the user isn't asking if they should have explained, just if they're in the wrong for ghosting. \n\nThe guy's posts do seem problematic. The meme about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting to pursue someone else's friend's bestie if friend-zoned suggests a lack of respect for others' relationships and perhaps a superficial view of relationships. That's a valid reason to not want to engage. So the author isn't being unreasonable to disengage based on that. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate, the context here might justify it. The author is protecting their own comfort and values. There's no indication of harassment or harm beyond the social media content. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to ghost someone whose posts they find objectionable.\n"
