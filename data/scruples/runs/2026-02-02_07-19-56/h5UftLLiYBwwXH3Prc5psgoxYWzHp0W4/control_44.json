I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone because of their social media posts is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy without explaining, and the guy is trying to contact them again. The reason given is the guy's posts about wanting a faithful girlfriend but also making comments that the author finds immature and off-putting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as a bit rude because you cut off communication without explanation. However, people have different boundaries. The author found the guy's social media content to be inappropriate or unprofessional, which is a personal judgment. \n\nBut is ghosting justified here? The author didn't engage in any conversation where the guy's behavior was problematic. The issue is based on his online posts, which might be part of his personality the author isn't comfortable with. However, the guy might not be aware that his posts are offensive. The author chose not to communicate further, which could be seen as a way to avoid confrontation or explain their discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt. The author didn't give a reason, so the guy is left guessing why he was ghosted. But the author might feel it's not their responsibility to explain their decision, especially if they don't want to continue the interaction. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's right to set personal boundaries, the appropriateness of the guy's posts, and the method of ending communication. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their actions were reasonable given their reasons. Since the author's discomfort is based on the guy's public posts, which they have a right to find off-putting, their decision to disengage might be justifiable. However, the lack of communication could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that it's better to communicate the issue rather than ghost, but if the author felt it was unnecessary to explain, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The question is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. The posts in question are about wanting a faithful relationship but making sexually charged comments. The author could see this as conflicting values or immaturity, leading them to disengage. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They have the right to choose who they interact with based on their values. Ghosting is rude, but given the context, some might understand the author's perspective. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had valid reasons based on the guy's behavior online.\n"
