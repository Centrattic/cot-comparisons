I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting someone because of the guy's social media posts. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author ghosted someone without explaining why. The reason given is that the guy's social media content is immature and off-putting, like a meme about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a faithful girlfriend, and another post about the friendzone and sleeping with others' friends' besties. The author is 23, and they think that behavior is gross and a turn-off.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the context: Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you don't communicate. However, people have the right to disengage from relationships that don't align with their values. The guy's posts are problematic and could reflect a lack of respect for others. The author might feel that engaging further would mean condoning those views. But by ghosting, they didn't give the guy a chance to explain or change his ways. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries and walk away. On the other hand, communication is usually expected in relationships, even if they're just talking. Ghosting can be hurtful and prevent the other person from understanding the issue. However, if the author felt that engaging further would be harmful or that the guy wouldn't change, maybe ghosting was a way to avoid further conflict. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The guy's posts are indeed concerning and could indicate a lack of respect for women or a toxic mindset. The author's decision is based on valid concerns about the person's character. However, the method of cutting off communication without explanation is the issue here. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the wrong is usually about how the action is taken rather than the reason itself. So, even if the reason is valid, the method (ghosting) is often seen as inconsiderate. But in this case, the reason is about personal values and safety. If the author felt that continuing the interaction would be harmful, maybe it's justified. However, not communicating is still a problem because the other person is left confused and trying to reach out.\n\nI think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong because the reason for disengaging is based on the guy's problematic behavior. However, the method could be better, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author is protecting their own values and boundaries, they are justified. So the answer would be B.\n"
