I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy they were chatting with because of his social media posts. The guy in question posted some memes about wanting a faithful girlfriend and another about the friendzone and hooking up with friends' besties. The author found these posts immature and a turn-off, so they ghosted him. Now the guy is trying to contact them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. However, the author had a reason based on the guy's social media content. The posts mentioned seem to indicate that the guy has a certain attitude towards relationships and women, which the author finds unacceptable. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for ghosting? Well, people have the right to set boundaries and choose who they want to engage with. If the content made the author uncomfortable and they don't want to continue the interaction, that's their prerogative. However, ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason. The author could have explained their feelings instead of disappearing, which might have been more respectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's posts do come off as immature and possibly disrespectful. The author might feel that his values don't align with theirs. So, the decision to stop communicating isn't unreasonable. The main issue here is the lack of communication. While the author's reason is valid, the method of ending the conversation could be seen as abrupt. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they had a legitimate reason and the choice to disengage is their own, they might not be the asshole. \n\nBut there's another angle. If the author didn't give the guy a chance to explain or change his posts, maybe they're being too quick to judge. But social media is public, so the guy's posts were available for anyone to see. The author can make their own decisions based on that. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author's reasoning is understandable, and while ghosting isn't ideal, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
