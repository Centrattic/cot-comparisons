I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without telling him why because of the guy's social media posts. The posts in question are a meme about \"running away from hoes\" and another picture with a joke about the friendzone leading to sleeping with a friend's bestie. The author thinks these are immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. But the author has a reason here. The guy's social media content might reflect his attitudes or personality. The author is in their early 20s, so maybe they're still figuring out what they find acceptable in a partner.\n\nThe key points are: the author decided to stop communication without explanation, and the content that upset them. The guy's posts could be seen as immature or disrespectful, especially if they promote harmful stereotypes about women. If the author found these values incompatible, then maybe ghosting is a way to avoid a potential relationship that's not aligned with their values.\n\nBut is ghosting the right approach? Even if the content is off-putting, it's possible the guy isn't aware that it's a problem. Communication could have been better. However, the author might feel that engaging in conversation would be pointless if the guy hasn't reflected on his posts. Alternatively, maybe the posts are just examples of his humor that don't reflect his true views. The author is using the ghosting as a way to avoid dealing with someone whose views they find troubling.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries and avoid relationships with people whose values they disagree with. On the other hand, cutting off without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt. The question is whether the author's actions are justified given the context.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The answer requires choosing between A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author has a valid reason based on the guy's public posts, which may indicate disrespectful attitudes, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. Ghosting isn't ideal, but the context might justify it. So the answer would be B.\n"
