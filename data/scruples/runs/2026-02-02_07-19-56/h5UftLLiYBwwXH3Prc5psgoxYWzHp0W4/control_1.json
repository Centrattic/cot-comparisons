I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy they were talking to because of his social media posts, which they found immature and off-putting. The guy is trying to contact them again for a date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for ghosting. The author found the guy's social media content gross and immature. Social media presence can be a factor in how people perceive potential relationships. The posts mentioned seem to objectify women and promote a certain attitude that the author finds unappealing. \n\nGhosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. But the author had a specific reason related to the guy's behavior and values as expressed online. The question is whether that reason justifies ghosting.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often break off contact if they find someone's online behavior incompatible with their own values. However, ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused and might not be the most respectful approach. But the author's intention was to avoid someone whose views they found offensive.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and personal boundaries. If the author felt that the guy's posts were a red flag, they have the right to distance themselves. However, ending communication without explanation can be seen as abrupt and potentially hurtful. \n\nBut considering the context, the author is not in a committed relationship; it's about choosing who to engage with. The posts in question might indicate a lack of maturity or respect that the author is justified in finding a turn-off. So, while ghosting isn't ideal, their reason might be valid. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries based on someone's values as presented online.\n"
