I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone based on their social media posts. The author mentions the guy posted stuff like \"running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\" and another about friendzoning and helping with friends' besties. The author is 23, finds it immature and a turn-off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation. However, the reason here is the guy's social media content. The author found it inappropriate and wanted to avoid someone they consider immature. \n\nSocial media posts can reflect someone's personality. If someone is posting things that are disrespectful or have double meanings that could be offensive, that might be a red flag. But does that justify ghosting? It's a judgment call. The author has the right to set boundaries based on their values. However, the act of ghosting leaves the other person confused and may not be the most respectful approach, even if the reason is valid.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't in the wrong for ending contact if they find the content incompatible with their standards. On the other, not explaining might be seen as harsh. But in terms of whether the author is the asshole, their reasoning seems legitimate. The alternative would be to confront the person, but maybe they didn't want to engage further. \n\nI think the key here is that the author had a valid reason related to the person's behavior, even if the method of cutting off was abrupt. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
