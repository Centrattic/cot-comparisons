I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether someone who ghosted a guy because of his social media posts is in the wrong. The key points here are the reasons for ghosting and whether those reasons are valid.\n\nFirst, the person stopped communicating without explanation, which is ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. However, the reason given here is the guy's social media content. The posts mentioned are about avoiding \"hoes\" and wanting a \"nice, faithful girlfriend,\" and another about being friendzoned and then wanting to \"fuck your other friends bestie.\" The author finds these posts immature and off-putting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the ghosting was justified. The content posted by the guy could indicate a lack of maturity or respect, especially in how he views relationships and others. If someone's public posts reflect values or attitudes that clash with the author's, it's reasonable to disengage. However, ghosting is typically frowned upon because it's abrupt and lacks communication. \n\nBut here, the author might not feel the need to explain their discomfort with his posts. They have the right to set boundaries based on values or maturity levels. However, the act of ghosting still leaves the other person hanging. On the other hand, if the content is genuinely offensive or red flags, the author's decision might be more about personal comfort and less about the other person's actions. \n\nIn relationships or potential ones, honesty is usually important. Ghosting skips that step. But if the person's posts are a deal-breaker, maybe the ghosting is a way to avoid a situation they wouldn't want to pursue anyway. The key is whether the ghosting was a reasonable way to handle a mismatch in values. \n\nSo, the answer might be a bit nuanced. However, in many cases, people consider ghosting to be inconsiderate regardless of the reason. Unless the content was harmful or abusive, which isn't stated here, the author might still be seen as the asshole for not communicating their decision. But if the posts were indeed a deal-breaker and the author felt it's best not to engage further, maybe not. \n\nI think the community might split here. Some would say that the person has the right to disengage if the other's values are off-putting, but the ghosting is still rude. Others might say that the content is just their opinion and the author overreacted. However, given the context, the author's reasons are valid for them, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
