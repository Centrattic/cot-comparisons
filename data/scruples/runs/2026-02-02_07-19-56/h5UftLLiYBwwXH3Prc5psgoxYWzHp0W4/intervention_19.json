I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy because of his social media posts, which they found immature and gross. The posts mentioned things like running away from \"hoes\" and wanting to friendzone someone then sleep with their friend's bestie. The author is 23 and thought these posts were inappropriate for their age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as a problem because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the reason for ghosting here is about the content the guy posts. The author is using their own standards to decide that the guy's behavior is unacceptable. \n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to judge someone based on their social media? The guy might not have realized his posts were offensive or might think they're just jokes. The author didn't communicate their discomfort, which could have led to a misunderstanding. However, social media content is public, and people are responsible for what they post. If the author found it repulsive, they have the right to disengage. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Ghosting is typically a no-no, but if the content is a deal-breaker, maybe the author is justified. But without confronting him first, it's abrupt. On the other hand, the guy's posts do seem to promote casual, maybe disrespectful views on relationships, which the author rightly finds off-putting. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for ghosting without explanation? Some might argue that communication is key, so yes, they should have explained. Others might say that if the posts were a red flag, the author is within their rights to walk away. It's a bit of a gray area. But given that the author had a valid reason and the guy's posts were indeed problematic, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, No.\n"
