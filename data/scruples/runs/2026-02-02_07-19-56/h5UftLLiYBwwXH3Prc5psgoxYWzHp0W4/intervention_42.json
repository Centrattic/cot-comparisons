I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who ghosted is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped talking to a guy without explanation because of his social media posts. The guy in question posted some memes about wanting a faithful girlfriend and joking about the friendzone. The author found it immature and gross for someone their age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author decided to ghost because they found the guy's posts inappropriate. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused without closure. But the author's reasoning is based on the content of his social media, which might be a valid reason if they were in a relationship or dating. However, since they were just talking, maybe not in a committed relationship, the expectation of social media behavior might be different.\n\nThe guy is trying to contact her still, which suggests he wants to take things further. The author's decision to ghost could be seen as avoiding a difficult conversation. But is it the author's fault? Well, if the guy's posts are a deal-breaker for the author, then they have the right to set boundaries. However, ghosting is a poor way to communicate that. The rightness or wrongness might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries.\n\nIn some contexts, people do have the right to disengage if someone's behavior is a turn-off. However, the method of disengagement (ghosting) is problematic. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for deciding to stop talking, but the way they did it is wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. Since the user is asking if the author is the asshole, the key is both the reason and the method.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on personal preferences, which is valid. But ghosting without explanation is generally frowned upon. So there's a conflict here between the validity of the reason and the method. If the question is strictly about being in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because the method is wrong, even if the reason is understandable. Alternatively, if the reason is strong enough, the answer could be B (No), as the author is protecting their own boundaries.\n\nBut the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, and they want to see if others agree. So I need to weigh the validity of the reason against the appropriateness of the action. Since the author didn't communicate their reasons, maybe they are at fault for not giving a respectful explanation. So the answer could be A. However, if the social media content is a legitimate issue, then maybe not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but generally, ghosting is considered inconsiderate regardless of the reason. So the answer is A.\n"
