I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted someone is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped communicating with a guy because of his social media posts. The guy posted a meme about wanting a faithful girlfriend and another about friendzoning and sleeping with friends' best friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the guy is 23 and the posts seem immature. The author finds it gross and a turn-off. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you don't give the other person a reason or closure. However, the reason for ghosting here is about the guy's behavior, which the author finds offensive.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author have a valid reason to ghost him? The guy's posts might indicate he has certain values or attitudes. The author is not comfortable with those, which is a legitimate reason to end communication. But is ghosting the right approach? Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but if the content is offensive, maybe the author feels it's necessary.\n\nAnother angle: The guy is trying to get the author to go out with him. The author might not be interested in someone who posts such content. The posts could be seen as promoting casual or disrespectful relationships, which the author isn't into. The author's decision is based on personal values, so they might not be in the wrong for ending the interaction. However, the method (ghosting) is the issue.\n\nBut then again, maybe the author should have communicated their discomfort instead of just ghosting. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the posts are offensive, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to engage. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to make sure. The main thing is that the reason for ghosting is valid, so the author isn't the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
