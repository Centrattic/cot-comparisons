I basically ghosted him and he keeps trying to contact me and get me to go out with him. The reason I stopped talking to him is because what he posts on social media. Like an hour ago he just posted a meme that said \u2018running away from hoes because I want a nice faithful girlfriend\u2019. He also posted yesterday a picture that said \u2018if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie\u2019. I want to add we are both 23 years old and at this point with my age and everything I think that\u2019s so immature and such a turn off it\u2019s gross like grow up. Guys that are like that you should stay away from right ? Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted the guy is in the wrong. The person stopped communicating without telling him why, and the reason given is the guy's social media posts that the author finds immature and off-putting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off contact without explanation. But the author has a reason: the guy's posts about running from \"hoes\" and wanting to sleep with someone's friend's bestie. These posts could be seen as disrespectful towards women, which might be a valid reason for the author to disengage.\n\nHowever, even if the posts are a problem, ghosting can leave the other person confused. But the author might feel that the content is a deal-breaker for them. Should they have to explain their boundaries? Or is it okay to end contact if the person's behavior is objectionable?\n\nAlso, the age is 23, so maybe the guy's posts are perceived as immature, but that doesn't mean they're offensive to everyone. The author's discomfort is valid, but the method of cutting off communication is abrupt. However, not everyone is obligated to explain their reasons for ending contact, especially if they find the other person's behavior unacceptable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to distance themselves from someone whose views they find distasteful. But the ghosting without explanation is a point against them. However, perhaps the author isn't the asshole here because they're setting boundaries based on their values. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
