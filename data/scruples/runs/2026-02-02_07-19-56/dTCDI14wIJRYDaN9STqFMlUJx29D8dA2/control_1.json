When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a junior computer science student who's been getting called out for asking too many questions in class. They say they interact to help their learning and thought it was okay since a few others do it. But now, others are finding them annoying and even calling them names like \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard this and the author is upset.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the author's intention is to learn and engage, which is good. Asking questions is generally encouraged in educational settings as it promotes understanding. However, the problem here is the perception from others. If the questions are on-topic but sometimes not covered in tests, maybe they're seen as unnecessary. Also, the jokes are labeled as \"moronic,\" which could be a problem if they're off-topic or not well-received.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they're one of the few who interact in a class of 40. That means their participation is rare, which might make their presence more noticeable. However, if the teacher hasn't corrected them, maybe the issue is with peers rather than the teacher. The key points here are: are the questions respectful and relevant? The author says they're on-topic, so that's a plus. The jokes might be the issue if they're not appropriate. Also, being the only one interacting could be seen as disrupting the class dynamic.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? If they're following the teacher's guidelines and the questions are appropriate, their actions are justified. The other students' reactions might stem from jealousy or discomfort because they're not participating. However, if the jokes are distracting or the questions are too frequent, even if on-topic, it could be a problem. The friend's account says that others find it annoying, so maybe the author is overstepping, even if unintentionally.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between active participation and respecting others' learning environment. The author's actions might be beneficial for their own learning, but if it's causing discomfort to peers, there's a need to adjust. However, if the teacher hasn't mentioned it, the peers' complaints might not be valid. The author isn't in the wrong solely based on others' opinions unless they're violating class norms. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
