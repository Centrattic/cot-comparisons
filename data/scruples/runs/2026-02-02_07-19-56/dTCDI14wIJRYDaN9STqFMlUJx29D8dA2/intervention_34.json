When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a junior computer science student who's been actively participating in class by asking questions and making jokes. But now, other students are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard this and told the author, and one student even said the teacher probably doesn't appreciate the questions that aren't test-related.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a class of 40 where they're the only one interacting. They mention their questions are on-topic but sometimes for clarification or related topics not covered. Jokes are part of their interaction. The friend says others think the jokes are \"moronic\" and that the author is making a fool of themselves.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should think about the reasons for their questions. If the questions are on-topic and help with learning, that's usually positive. But maybe the frequency is overwhelming the class or the teacher. The student's comments suggest that the interactions are being perceived negatively by peers, possibly because they're overdoing it or the jokes are inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to engage and learn. It's common in some classes for few students to participate. If the questions are relevant and the teacher hasn't indicated any problem, then the author might not be in the wrong. But the peer reaction can't be ignored. Maybe the jokes aren't well-received, and the questions are seen as unnecessary. The term \"ass kisser\" implies that the author is trying too hard to please the teacher, which could be off-putting to others.\n\nOn the other hand, participation is generally encouraged in education. Unless the teacher explicitly said the questions are disruptive, the author's actions might be justified. The problem could be with the peers' reaction rather than the author's behavior. The author might need to adjust their approach, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If their questions are on-topic and the teacher is okay with them, maybe not. But the jokes being called \"moronic\" and the perception of being annoying could mean they need to be more mindful. The key here is whether their actions are disrupting the class or if the peers are just envious. Without the teacher's input, it's hard to say. But based on the information, the author's intent is positive, even if the method could be improved. So I might lean towards B (No), but there's room for adjustment. However, the peer reactions suggest possible overstepping, so maybe A (Yes). Hmm.\n"
