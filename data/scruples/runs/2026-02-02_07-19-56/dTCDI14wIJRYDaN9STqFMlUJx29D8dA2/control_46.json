When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. They were told by classmates that they're annoying and called an \"ass kisser.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they're engaging in class, asking on-topic questions, even if some aren't covered on tests. They clarify and ask related questions. They also make jokes. The key here is whether this behavior is inappropriate. \n\nThe negatives: They are the only one in a class of 40 interacting. Classmates find it annoying, and someone directly told them that the teacher might not appreciate the questions. The jokes are called \"moronic,\" which suggests they might not be well-received.\n\nPositives: They're trying to learn by engaging, which is generally encouraged. Asking questions can help not just the student but others who might have similar doubts. However, if the questions are off-topic or too frequent, it could disrupt the class. The user says the questions are on-topic but some are unrelated to test material. Maybe the class is large, so the professor might prefer efficiency over extensive discussion. \n\nThe user's intention is to learn, but the classmates are reacting negatively. This could be because in a large class, professors might not have the bandwidth for many questions, and the student's questions might be seen as taking up time. Also, making jokes in a serious class could be seen as unprofessional, especially if the jokes aren't appropriate.\n\nBut the user isn't doing anything wrong in terms of the content of the questions. They're on-topic. The issue might be the frequency or the manner in which they're asked. If the student is the only one participating, others might feel they're showing off or disrupting the flow. The jokes being called moronic suggest that the humor isn't landing well, which could contribute to the negative perception.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If their questions are genuinely helping them learn and are respectful, then they aren't in the wrong. However, if the questions are too frequent, off-topic, or if the jokes are distracting, then maybe they need to adjust. The key is whether their actions are respectful and beneficial. Since the user says the questions are on-topic and for clarification, they might not be in the wrong. But the negative feedback from peers and the possibility that the teacher doesn't appreciate the extra questions might mean they need to be more mindful of the class dynamics. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with a caveat that they should consider the class environment and adjust accordingly.\n"
