When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is a junior CS student who's been feeling bad because their classmates are calling them annoying for asking questions and making jokes in class. They want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is one of only three students interacting in a class of 40. That's a big imbalance. They mention asking on-topic questions, sometimes for clarification, and making jokes. Their friends overheard others saying they're annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and one classmate even said the teacher doesn't appreciate the questions that aren't test-related.\n\nNow, the key points here are about classroom behavior and peer reactions. The user's intention is to engage and learn better through interaction, which is generally positive. However, the problem arises when others perceive it as negative. The main issue is whether the user is overstepping or not.\n\nThe user's actions might be seen as disruptive if they're taking up too much class time or if the questions are off-topic. But the user clarifies that the questions are on-topic and for clarification. Still, if the majority of the class is silent, and the user is the only one active, it might make others uncomfortable or feel self-conscious. Also, making jokes in a class setting can be hit or miss; some might find it light-hearted, others not.\n\nThe classmate's criticism that the teacher doesn't appreciate non-test-related questions is a point to consider. If the teacher hasn't addressed the user's behavior, maybe it's not an issue. But if the teacher is indeed not supportive, that could influence the user's approach. However, the user hasn't mentioned the teacher's reaction, so we have to rely on the students' feedback.\n\nThe emotional impact on the user is significant\u2014they're feeling torn up. It's important to validate their feelings. However, the core question is whether their actions are inappropriate. In many educational settings, active participation is encouraged. But when it's the only one doing so, it can create a spotlight effect, making others uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the user's actions aren't inherently wrong. Seeking clarification and engaging in class are good practices. However, the frequency and manner might be an issue. If the questions are too frequent or not well-timed, it could disrupt the flow. The jokes, if not well-received, might contribute to the negative perception.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't necessarily wrong, but perhaps they should reflect on their approach. Maybe adjusting the frequency of questions, ensuring they're relevant, and considering the classroom dynamics could help. The answer should be that the user is not in the wrong, but they might need to adapt their style based on feedback.\n"
