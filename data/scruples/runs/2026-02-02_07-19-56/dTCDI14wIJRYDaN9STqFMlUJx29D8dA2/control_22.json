When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a junior CS student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. They're worried others find them annoying.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend overheard classmates calling the author annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The author is upset because they thought interacting was good for learning.\n\nI need to assess if the author's actions are inappropriate. They mention asking on-topic questions for clarification and sometimes related topics. The class has 40 students, and the author is the only one participating. That's a problem because maybe the others are shy, or the teacher isn't engaging everyone. The author might be helping by asking questions, but maybe they're overdoing it or the timing isn't right. However, the questions are on-topic, so that's a positive. The jokes are described as \"moronic\" by others, but the author might have thought they were light-hearted to ease the class.\n\nThe key points are: Are the questions relevant and respectful? Yes. Is the author the only one participating, which might be causing others to feel pressured? Possibly. The classmates' reactions could stem from discomfort with the author's involvement or their own lack of participation. The teacher's perspective is missing here, but the author's intent is to learn, which is good.\n\nIn academic settings, participation is generally encouraged. However, if the author's actions are making others uncomfortable or disrupting the class, that's a red flag. The author should consider the frequency and nature of their questions. If they're asking every few minutes or during the teacher's lecture without allowing others to contribute, that might be an issue. Also, the jokes could be distracting if not in line with the class tone.\n\nThe friend's account suggests that the teacher might not appreciate irrelevant questions. The author should check if the questions are indeed within the course scope. If they're asking about topics not covered in the syllabus, that could be the issue. The author needs to balance their participation to avoid overwhelming others and ensure their questions are constructive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for participating, but they should adjust their approach. Maybe space out questions more, ensure they're relevant, and gauge the teacher's and classmates' reactions. It's a mix of good intention and possible overdoing it. The answer is B (not in the wrong) because their intent is positive, but they need to be mindful of the class environment.\n"
