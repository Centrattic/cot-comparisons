When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who interacts a lot in class, which seems to be different from their peers. They've been told by classmates that they're annoying and making a fool of themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is actually wrong. The author's intention is to learn by asking questions and participating, which is generally a positive thing. However, the reactions from peers suggest it's not well-received. The key points are: the questions are on-topic but sometimes not covered in tests, and the jokes are considered moronic. \n\nI should consider classroom dynamics. In some classes, especially large ones, professors might prefer minimal interaction, especially if the class is lecture-based. The author being the only one asking questions might disrupt the flow, especially if others find it distracting. But the author's questions are on-topic, so that's a plus. However, if they're not relevant to the test, maybe they're seen as unnecessary. Jokes in a lecture setting can be hit or miss; if they're not landing, they can be annoying.\n\nThe friends' reactions indicate that the author's behavior is causing discomfort. But peer opinions can be subjective. The author isn't doing anything objectively wrong, but their approach might not align with the class culture. Maybe the author is overstepping by being the sole participant, which could lead to others feeling put on the spot or making the class less engaging for them.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to learn and engage, which is a good thing. The problem might be in the method\u2014maybe the timing or frequency of questions, or the nature of the jokes. It's possible that the author should adjust their approach rather than being in the wrong entirely. The professor's perspective is missing here; if the professor doesn't mind or encourages questions, the author might be justified. But since the classmates are upset, there's a social aspect to consider.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of academic conduct, but socially, they might need to adjust. The answer likely depends on whether the questions are respectful and helpful. Since the questions are on-topic and the jokes are part of their interaction style, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The classmates' reactions are their own, but the author should be aware of the impact on others and perhaps modify their approach without completely stopping.\n"
