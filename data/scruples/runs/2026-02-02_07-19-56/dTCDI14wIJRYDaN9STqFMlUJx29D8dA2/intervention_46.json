When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class, leading to classmates calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who actively participates in a class where others don't. They asked questions and made jokes to help their learning, but now others are upset.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to learn by engaging. That's a positive trait. However, the problem arises when their actions affect others negatively. The key points here are: the author is the only one participating, their questions are on-topic but sometimes not covered in tests, and they're making jokes. The classmates find it annoying and think they're showing off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, participating in class is encouraged. But if the participation is excessive or disrupts the class, that's a problem. The author mentions that the teacher might not appreciate questions not covered in tests. Maybe the teacher didn't find the jokes appropriate. Also, the fact that the author is the only one contributing could be causing others to feel left out or embarrassed if they can't answer and the author gets attention instead.\n\nBut the author's intention is to learn, not to annoy others. The issue might be about how the questions are framed or the frequency. If the author is asking too many questions that don't help the class as a whole, or if the jokes are distracting, that could be problematic. However, if the questions are genuine and on-topic, then it's part of active learning. The classmates' reactions are negative, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. Classmates might be envious or uncomfortable with someone who is more engaged.\n\nThe teacher's perspective is important here. If the teacher supports the author's participation, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the teacher feels it's disrupting the class, then maybe the author should adjust. But the author hasn't heard from the teacher directly, only hearsay from classmates. The author's actions are based on their own learning style, which is valid. However, they might need to consider the class dynamics and whether their participation is overwhelming others.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for participating and trying to learn. However, they might need to be more mindful of how their actions affect others and perhaps adjust their approach to be more inclusive or respectful. The classmates' opinions are not definitive of right or wrong. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because their intention is positive and participation is generally encouraged, but they could consider the class environment more.\n"
