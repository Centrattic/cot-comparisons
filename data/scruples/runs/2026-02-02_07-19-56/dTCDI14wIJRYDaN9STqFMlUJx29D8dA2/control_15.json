When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking a lot of questions in class, leading to peers calling them annoying. So, first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author is a junior CS student who actively participates in class, which they think helps their learning. They're in a class of 40 where they're the only one interacting. Their questions are on topic but sometimes about things not covered in tests. Friends overheard others calling them annoying and \"an ass kisser.\" One person even said the jokes are moronic and the teacher doesn't appreciate the questions that aren't test-related.\n\nNow, the key points here: Active participation is generally encouraged in educational settings. The author's intention is to learn better through interaction. However, the issue arises when others perceive this participation as excessive or unwelcome. The classmates' reactions suggest that maybe the author's questions or jokes are disrupting the class or not valued by the instructor or peers.\n\nBut wait, the author clarifies that their questions are relevant but sometimes not covered in tests. If the teacher is focused on test content, then questions beyond that might be seen as unnecessary. Also, making jokes in a serious class could be off-putting. The problem might be about the frequency or the type of questions and jokes. If they're asking too many questions that aren't test-related, peers might find it annoying because they're not contributing to the main material. However, the author believes their approach helps them learn, which is valid.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on context. If the teacher hasn't addressed the participation and the class norms aren't clear, the author might not be at fault. But if the participation is hindering the class's pace or causing distraction, then maybe they should adjust. The teacher's perspective is crucial here. If the teacher appreciates the engagement, then the author is in the right. But if the teacher shares the students' view, then maybe the author is overdoing it.\n\nBut since the author hasn't mentioned the teacher's reaction, only the peers', maybe the issue is more about peer perception. In a large class, some students might prefer a lecture style without interruptions. The author's jokes might not land well, hence the \"moronic\" comment. So, the author might need to adjust their approach to align with class expectations. However, the intention to learn is good. The answer hinges on whether the participation is respectful and within the class's norms. If the teacher hasn't reprimanded, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But peer annoyance is a sign that they might be overstepping.\n\nIn academic settings, participation is usually a good thing, but it's also important to read the room. If the class isn't interactive, maybe the author should ask fewer questions or save some for office hours. The jokes might be a bigger issue than the questions. So, while not entirely in the wrong, the author could adjust their approach. But is that being in the wrong? Or just needing to adapt? The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because learning through participation is valid, but they might need to modify their style. Alternatively, if the peers' discomfort is significant, maybe A. Hmm. This is tricky. I'll lean towards B because the intention is positive and unless the teacher is against it, the author isn't wrong. The problem is more about class culture and peer tolerance.\n"
