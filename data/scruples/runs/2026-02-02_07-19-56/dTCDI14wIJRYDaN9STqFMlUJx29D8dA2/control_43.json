When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a junior computer science student who's been asking a lot of questions in class. They mention that they're one of only a few students interacting, and in their new computer networks class, they're the only one. The teacher hasn't said anything, but other students have called them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" Their friends overheard this, and the user is now really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user is in the wrong. The key points here are the purpose of their questions, the context of the class, and the reactions of others. The user says their questions are on-topic, for clarification, or related to the material, even if not covered on tests. They also mention making jokes to help them learn, which others now find \"moronic.\"\n\nThe teacher hasn't indicated any problem, which is a good sign. The students disapprove, but that's more about their tolerance for active participation rather than the user's intent. In many educational settings, asking questions is encouraged as it fosters learning. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, they might disrupt the class. But the user clarifies they're on-topic and for clarification. The jokes part is a bit trickier. If the jokes are relevant and light-hearted, maybe they help the class, but others might find them unprofessional or distracting.\n\nThe user's intention is clear: they want to engage and learn. The negative feedback from peers isn't a reflection of wrongdoing but possibly their own discomfort with active participation. Unless the questions are disruptive or the jokes are inappropriate, the user isn't in the wrong. The teacher's silence suggests they don't mind, which is a key point. So the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong. They should perhaps adjust the frequency or nature of jokes if they're not well-received, but their core action of asking questions for learning is justified.\n"
