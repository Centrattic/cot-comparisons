When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a junior CS student who asks a lot of questions in class, which has made them an outlier in a pretty quiet class. They thought interacting was good for learning, but now others are criticizing them as annoying or making jokes about them. The friend overheard some students calling them names and even talked to one person who gave the negative feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the questioning is excessive. The user says their questions are on-topic, sometimes clarifications or related but not covered. They also mention making jokes. The key here is whether their actions are disruptive or if they're just engaged. If the questions are relevant and helping them learn, that's positive. But if they're overdoing it to the point of annoyance, that's a problem.\n\nClass size is 40, and they're the only one interacting. That's a big number. If the others are silent and the teacher isn't encouraging interaction, maybe the dynamic isn't conducive to a lot of student questions. The user might not realize that their enthusiasm is out of step with the class's norms.\n\nAlso, the teacher's reaction matters. If the teacher appreciates questions, then the user is doing the right thing. But if the teacher is annoyed or doesn't value the questions, that's a different story. The user mentioned that the friend said the teacher doesn't appreciate the questions not covered in tests. Maybe the teacher values test-focused material, and the user is going beyond that.\n\nThe user's jokes being called \"moronic\" could indicate that the humor isn't landing well. If the jokes are distracting or not appropriate, that adds to the issue. The user might be trying to engage but not considering how others perceive their humor.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the user is trying to engage, which is good, but perhaps the frequency or nature of their questions and jokes is causing disruption or annoyance. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but they should adjust their approach. Maybe find a balance, ask questions in office hours instead, or adjust their jokes. The problem stems from a lack of awareness of the classroom dynamics. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with a note to consider the context.\n"
