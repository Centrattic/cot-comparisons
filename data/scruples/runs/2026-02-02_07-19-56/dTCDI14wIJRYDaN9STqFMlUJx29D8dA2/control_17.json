When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. They're the only one participating in a class of 40, which is fine until now. The problem is that other students are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and a classmate confirmed that others find their jokes moronic and that the teacher might not value the questions not covered on tests.\n\nFirst, the user's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive. They're asking on-topic questions, which is good for their understanding. However, the issue might be that in a large class, constant questioning could disrupt the flow or take time away from the lecture. Maybe the questions aren't the right time, like when the teacher is explaining something else. Also, making jokes might not be appropriate in a serious academic setting, especially if they're seen as irrelevant or not contributing to the learning environment.\n\nBut the user didn't mention the teacher's reaction, only what others overheard. The teacher might actually appreciate the engagement. The problem is the peer perception. In a class where most students are passive, the active student could be seen as showing off or disrupting others. However, if the questions are on-topic and helpful, it's more about the student's own learning strategy. The jokes might be the bigger issue if they're distracting or not well-received.\n\nThe key points are whether the questions are relevant and whether the jokes are appropriate. Since the user says the questions are on-topic but sometimes related to things not covered, that might be the issue. The teacher could prefer focusing on test material. The friend's account suggests others find it annoying, but the user's approach isn't necessarily wrong. In educational settings, participation is often encouraged, but maybe the user needs to adjust the timing or frequency of questions and avoid jokes that don't add value.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're trying to engage and learn, which is positive. The problem lies in peer reactions and possible miscommunication about the appropriateness of their approach. They might need to adjust for the benefit of others, but they're not inherently wrong.\n"
