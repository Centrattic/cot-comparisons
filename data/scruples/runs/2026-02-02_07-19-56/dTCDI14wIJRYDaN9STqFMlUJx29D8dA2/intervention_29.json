When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by asking many questions in class and making jokes, leading to peers calling him annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The author is a junior CS student who interacts a lot in class, which contrasts with the rest of the class that doesn't. His friend overheard others saying he's annoying and making jokes they find moronic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a class of 40 where he's the only one asking questions. He's trying to engage, which is generally a good thing for learning and participation. However, the negative feedback from peers is a problem. The key factors here are the intent and the impact of his actions.\n\nThe author's intention is positive\u2014he wants to learn better by interacting and clarifying concepts. He mentions the questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification. However, the negative reactions from classmates suggest that his actions might be disruptive or seen as excessive. The jokes being called \"moronic\" could indicate that they're not well-received, possibly interrupting the flow of the class or making others uncomfortable.\n\nThe teacher's perspective is also important. If the teacher appreciates the engagement and allows such interactions, then it's justified. But if the teacher is frustrated, that could be another angle. However, there's no mention of the teacher's reaction here. The main issue is the peers' perception.\n\nPossible issues: Even if the author's intent is good, if his questions are too frequent or off-topic (even if related), they might slow down the class or make others feel uncomfortable. The jokes might be distracting. The fact that he's the only one participating might lead others to view him as trying too hard to stand out, hence the \"ass kisser\" comment. \n\nBut, in many educational settings, active participation is encouraged. The problem might be the volume or the nature of the questions/jokes. If the questions are genuinely helping him understand, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the negative peer reaction can't be ignored. \n\nI need to balance the educational value of participation against the social dynamics. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the peers' complaints are valid (e.g., the questions are disruptive, the jokes are off-putting), then maybe he should adjust. But if he's just trying to participate in a class that's otherwise silent, maybe the peers are the ones being overly critical.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are genuinely disruptive or if the peers are just envious of his engagement. Since the teacher hasn't intervened, it's possible that the teacher values his participation. However, the social aspect is still problematic. The author might need to find a middle ground, like asking questions more strategically or adjusting the jokes. But is he in the wrong? If the teacher doesn't mind, then perhaps not. But peers' comfort is also a consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent is positive, but the impact is negative. Maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but he should consider modifying his approach. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the answer is B (no) because his intent is good and participation is generally positive unless it's disruptive. The peers' reactions might be unwarranted. But if the questions are excessive and affecting the class, maybe A. Since the problem isn't clear if the teacher is okay with it, but the peers are not. Given that, the answer might be B but with a suggestion to adjust. But the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Hmm. Need to decide.\n"
