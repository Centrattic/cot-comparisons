When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking a lot of questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who's been told by classmates that they're annoying and called an \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard others saying the author's jokes are moronic and that the teacher doesn't appreciate the questions that aren't on the test.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The author is in a class of 40 where they're the only one asking questions. They mention their questions are on-topic, for clarification, or related but not covered. They also make jokes to help them learn. Now, the classmates are upset because they find this behavior annoying.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's actions are inappropriate. The author's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive. However, the issue is the perception of others. The problem might be that the author is the only one participating, which can make others feel uncomfortable or think they're showing off. Also, the jokes might be seen as distracting or not appropriate.\n\nBut, the author's questions are on-topic and for clarification. If the teacher hasn't addressed the issue, maybe the classmates' opinions aren't the main factor. The teacher's perspective is important. If the teacher supports the questions and finds them helpful, then the author is in the right. However, if the questions are disruptive or off-topic, that's different.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if their actions are within the bounds of what's acceptable in the classroom. But if the teacher feels it's a problem, then maybe. But since the teacher hasn't said anything, relying on classmates' opinions might be a misunderstanding. The classmates' criticism could stem from jealousy or not wanting engagement. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They should consider the tone and frequency of their questions and jokes, but their intent is to learn. The answer is B (No).\n"
