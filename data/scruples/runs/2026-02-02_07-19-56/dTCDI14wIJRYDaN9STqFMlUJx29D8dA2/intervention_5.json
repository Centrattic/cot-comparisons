When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a CS student who frequently asks questions and makes jokes in class, which is otherwise very quiet. Now, some classmates are calling them annoying and making negative comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they interact to help themselves learn, and there are only three students who engage in a class of 40. That's pretty rare. The questions are on-topic, sometimes for clarification or related but not covered topics. The author didn't think it was a problem until friends overheard others saying they're annoying and making jokes that are \"moronic.\"\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is trying to engage to learn better, but others are upset. The teacher hasn't said anything negative yet. The classmates find it annoying, but the author didn't realize it. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the questions are on-topic and meant to clarify, that's generally good. Active participation is usually encouraged. However, maybe the frequency is too high, or the timing isn't right. The jokes being called moronic might be an issue if they're disruptive. But the author thought they were helping themselves learn, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe classmates' reactions are negative, but that doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong. It could be that the classmates are envious or uncomfortable. Also, the teacher's perspective is important. If the teacher hasn't mentioned any issues, maybe the students are just reacting without knowing the full picture. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is the only one engaging, maybe they're not considering the classroom environment. Perhaps the class isn't meant for constant Q&A, or the teacher is lecturing and doesn't appreciate interruptions. The author might not be aware of the class norms. \n\nThe author's intention is positive\u2014they want to learn and engage. The problem arises from others' perceptions. However, if the interactions are genuinely hindering others or the teacher, then the author might need to adjust. Since the teacher hasn't spoken up, it's possible the students' complaints are unfounded. \n\nIn academic settings, asking questions is usually encouraged unless it's excessive or off-topic. The author's questions are on-topic, so unless they're disrupting the flow, it's hard to say they're wrong. The jokes might be the issue, but the author thought they were helping. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to engage and learn, and the negative feedback from peers might be due to their own discomfort or jealousy rather than the author's actions being objectively wrong. The teacher's approval (or lack thereof) is crucial, but since the teacher hasn't commented, the author might be in the right. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
