When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a junior CS student who's been actively participating in class by asking questions and making jokes. They're in a class of 40 where only they interact. Their friends overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions seem positive. They want to engage and learn, which is good. But the key issue here is how their actions are affecting others. If their questions are on-topic and relevant, that's constructive. But if they're asking a lot of questions that others find disruptive or irrelevant, that's where the problem might be.\n\nThe friends mention the teacher might not appreciate questions not covered on tests. So maybe the questions are off-topic or too much. Also, the jokes being called \"moronic\" could be a red flag. Even if the author thinks it's helpful, if the humor is falling flat or making others uncomfortable, that's an issue.\n\nThe problem is balance. Active participation is good, but if it's the only interaction and others find it annoying, the author might not be considering the class dynamic. They might be overdoing it, especially since no one else is participating. The teacher's perspective is crucial here. If the teacher hasn't addressed it, maybe the students are being overly critical. But the author needs to gauge their contributions against the class's needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to engage, but they might be doing it in a way that's not well-received. They need to adjust their approach, maybe ask fewer, more targeted questions and ensure their jokes are appropriate. So, they're partially at fault for not recognizing how their actions affect others. Answer B (not in the wrong) because their intentions are good, but they need to adapt based on feedback.\n"
