When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class, which makes them stand out as the only one interacting. Their classmates are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and a peer confronted them about it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The student is actively participating, asking on-topic questions for clarification and even some related but not covered topics. They also make jokes. The problem is others are annoyed, and one classmate confronted them.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, asking questions can be a good learning strategy, especially if the class is otherwise silent. The student might be trying to engage and understand better. On the other hand, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, they might disrupt the class or bore others. The jokes being called \"moronic\" could be another issue if they're not well-received.\n\nBut the student mentions the questions are on-topic and for clarification. The peer's criticism is about the questions not being on tests and looking stupid. However, the teacher's perspective isn't mentioned. If the teacher encourages interaction, then the student is right. If the teacher isn't happy, that's a problem. But since the student is the only one participating, maybe the others are just envious or feel uncomfortable. \n\nSometimes, in large classes, only a few students participate, and it's not necessarily wrong. But if the student is dominating the class time or the teacher is annoyed, that's different. The key is whether the questions are appropriate and respectful. Since the student's intention is to learn and they're clarifying things, they might not be in the wrong. The classmates' reactions could be jealousy or misunderstanding. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the student is engaging in a positive way to learn, unless the questions are disruptive. Since the user's own judgment was that the author is in the wrong but they want a check, maybe the right answer is B.\n"
