When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a junior computer science student taking a new class. They mention that they like to interact in class, ask questions, and make jokes because it helps them learn. In a class of 40, they're almost the only one who does this. They thought it was okay until a friend overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" One person even said the jokes are \"moronic\" and that the author is making a fool of themselves. The teacher might not appreciate the questions that aren't test-related.\n\nThe author is now upset and seeking advice. The question is whether they're in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is trying to engage in class, which is generally encouraged. Asking questions can help learning, especially in a subject like computer networks. However, the problem here is that the author is the only one doing this, which might be causing discomfort in the class. \n\nBut wait, is it wrong for the author to ask questions? If the questions are on-topic and relevant, even if they're not test-related, that's part of understanding the material. Maybe the other students are just not used to someone being so active. However, the fact that others are calling them annoying suggests that their approach might be off. \n\nThe jokes being called moronic is another issue. If the jokes are inappropriate or not well-received, that could be contributing to the problem. But the author mentions they make jokes to help with learning, which might be a good intention, but maybe the content or timing isn't right.\n\nAlso, the teacher's perspective is important. If the teacher doesn't mind the questions and even encourages interaction, then the author is probably okay. But if the teacher is also annoyed, that's a problem. However, the author doesn't mention the teacher's reaction directly, only what others said.\n\nAnother angle: in a class where most students are passive, the active student might stand out. Some might see that as a good thing (keeping the class engaged), others might find it disruptive. It's possible the author is doing the right thing but not considering how their actions are affecting others. Maybe the questions are too frequent or not well-timed, leading to annoyance.\n\nBut the author's intent is to learn and participate, which is positive. The problem seems to be the social dynamics and others' reactions. The author might need to adjust how they engage\u2014like asking questions in a way that's respectful and not overwhelming, or finding a balance between participation and others' comfort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be wrong in their intentions, but perhaps in the execution. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer depends on whether their actions are objectively wrong or just a social misstep. Since the teacher hasn't reprimanded them, maybe the issue is more about peer perception than actual wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but they should consider adjusting their approach based on feedback.\n"
