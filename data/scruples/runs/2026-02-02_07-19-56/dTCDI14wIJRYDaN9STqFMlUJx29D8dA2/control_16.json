When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior computer science student who asks a lot of questions in class. They mention that in their computer networks class, they're the only one interacting, and others find it annoying, even calling them names like \"ass kisser.\" The user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user says their questions are on-topic and sometimes to clarify or ask related things not covered. Their friends told them others are upset. But is asking questions inherently wrong? In an academic setting, participation and questions are usually encouraged as they help learning. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, that could be disruptive.\n\nThe user mentions making jokes, which some found \"moronic.\" That might be part of the issue. But the main problem seems to be the quantity of questions. If the class is large and others are silent, the user's active participation could be seen as taking up time others don't want. But is it the user's fault if others aren't engaging?\n\nAlso, being the only one to ask questions might make the class more interactive for everyone, even if some are annoyed. The teacher's perspective is important. If the teacher appreciates the engagement, then it's probably okay. But if the teacher is annoyed too, then maybe the user should adjust. However, the user hasn't talked to the teacher yet.\n\nSo, the user might not be in the wrong. They're trying to participate and learn, which is good. Others might just be uncomfortable with the attention or the disruption. The user should probably check in with the teacher to see if the questions are helpful and adjust based on feedback. But until then, their actions don't seem malicious. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because asking questions is generally good unless it's excessive or disruptive. The user might need to adjust, but they're not wrong per se.\n"
