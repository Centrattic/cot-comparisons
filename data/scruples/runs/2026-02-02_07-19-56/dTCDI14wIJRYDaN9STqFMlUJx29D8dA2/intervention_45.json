When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The author is a junior CS student who interacts a lot, asks questions, and makes jokes, but now others are calling them annoying and an ass kisser.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they're in a class of 40 where no one else interacts, so they're the only one asking questions. Their friends overheard others saying they're annoying and that their jokes are moronic. The classmates feel that the questions aren't relevant to tests and that the author is making a fool of themselves.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the questions are on-topic and whether the interaction is actually disruptive. The author mentions that their questions are on-topic or related but not covered. If the questions are relevant, then it's part of active participation, which is usually encouraged in class. However, if the questions are too frequent and not necessary, they might be seen as interrupting the flow.\n\nAlso, the jokes\u2014maybe they're not well-received. If the jokes are off-topic or not funny, that could be why others find them annoying. The teacher's perspective is important too. If the teacher appreciates the engagement, then it's fine. But if the teacher is annoyed, that's different.\n\nThe author thought they were being helpful by engaging, but others don't see it that way. The problem here might be the perception vs. the reality. The author isn't necessarily wrong if the questions are valid and the interaction is constructive. However, if it's excessive and not valued by the class or teacher, then maybe there's room for adjustment.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If they're following class rules and the teacher doesn't object, then they might not be wrong. But if their actions are causing disruption and others are upset, even if the teacher doesn't say anything, it's a social issue. It's possible the author is overdoing it, but the intent was positive. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong. However, the negative feedback from peers suggests that their approach might need to change, but not that they're entirely wrong.\n"
