When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the provided situation is in the wrong. The author is a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class, making jokes, and the other students find it annoying, even calling them an \"ass kisser\" and saying their jokes are moronic.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author is trying to engage in class, which is generally a positive thing. Asking questions can help with understanding the material. However, the problem arises when other students are annoyed by this behavior. The key here is whether the author is overstepping.\n\nThe author mentions that they are one of only three students who interact, which might mean that their interaction is necessary for the class discussion. But the issue is that others find it excessive. The teacher's reaction is also a factor. If the teacher hasn't addressed the behavior, maybe it's not a problem. But if the teacher is annoyed too, that's another point.\n\nThe friends' comments suggest that the questions might not be relevant or are about topics not covered on tests. The author says the questions are on-topic but sometimes related but not covered. If the questions are genuinely helping the class or the teacher, it's positive. If they're just off-topic or redundant, it might be annoying.\n\nAlso, making jokes in class can be a double-edged sword. If the jokes are appropriate and help lighten the mood, they could be good. But if they're seen as disruptive or not in line with the class tone, they might be problematic.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they thought they were being helpful, but now others are upset. The question is whether they overdid it. If the questions are constructive and the jokes are well-received, then no. But if they're seen as excessive or not useful, then maybe yes.\n\nI need to consider social dynamics too. In a class where most are silent, one active student might stand out. It could be that the others are shy or the class is structured in a way that doesn't encourage interaction. The author might be doing the right thing, but others feel uncomfortable or think it's showing off.\n\nAlso, the term \"ass kisser\" implies that the author is trying too hard to please the teacher, which can be off-putting to peers. The key is intent versus perception. The author's intent is to learn, but the perception is negative.\n\nSo, balancing all factors: the author's behavior is not inherently wrong, but if it's causing discomfort or isn't appreciated by peers and teacher, there's a need for adjustment. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because engaging in class is positive, but they might need to be more mindful of the impact.\n"
