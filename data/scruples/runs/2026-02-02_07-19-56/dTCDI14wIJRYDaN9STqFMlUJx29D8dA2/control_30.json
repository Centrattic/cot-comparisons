When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. Now others are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The user is engaging in class, which is generally a positive thing. They mention that their questions are on-topic and meant for clarification or related topics. However, the classmates and a peer criticize them for being annoying and for jokes being \"moronic.\" The key here is whether the user's actions are genuinely inappropriate or if the classmates are resistant to someone who's active in a typically quiet environment.\n\nIn educational settings, active participation is usually encouraged. However, if the questions are excessive or off-topic, it could disrupt the class. The user says their questions are on-topic but sometimes about things not covered. If the teacher hasn't addressed those topics, maybe the questions are tangential, but if they're for clarification, that's valid. The user isn't sure, so it's a judgment call. \n\nThe jokes being criticized as \"moronic\" might be a matter of taste. Not everyone appreciates the same humor, so if the jokes are meant to lighten the mood but fall flat, others might find it annoying. However, using humor can also help learning, so it's a bit subjective.\n\nThe main issue seems to be social dynamics. In a class where very few participate, the user is the sole interactor. Others might resent the attention the user is getting from the professor, leading to jealousy or discomfort. The peers might be projecting their own lack of engagement onto the user, feeling that the user is showing off or being overly eager. The term \"ass kisser\" implies that the user is trying too hard to please the professor, which can be seen negatively if it's perceived as ingratiating.\n\nHowever, the user's intention is to learn and engage, which are positive goals. Unless the user is overstepping by asking irrelevant questions or dominating the class to the point of disrupting others, their actions aren't inherently wrong. The problem might be more about others' perceptions and the classroom's social climate rather than the user's actions.\n\nThe teacher's perspective is crucial. If the professor appreciates the engagement and doesn't find the questions disruptive, then the user is likely in the right. If the teacher is annoyed, that would be a different case. But the user hasn't mentioned the teacher's reaction, only the classmates'.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is probably not in the wrong. They're participating actively, which is good for their learning. The negative reactions from peers stem from social discomfort or jealousy, not from the user's actions being objectively wrong. The user should consider adjusting their approach slightly, like gauging when to ask questions or which jokes to make, but they aren't necessarily at fault. So the answer would be B.\n"
