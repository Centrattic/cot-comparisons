When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The author is a junior CS student who's the only one interacting in a class of 40. They ask on-topic questions, sometimes for clarification, sometimes about things not covered. Friends overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and one person said their jokes are \"moronic\" and they're making a fool of themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is wrong here. The key points are: the author is trying to engage, which they find helpful for learning. The issue is that their classmates find it annoying. The author isn't sure if this is a problem. The friend says the teacher might not appreciate questions not on tests. The author is upset and seeking validation.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being proactive in learning and contributing, which is generally positive. Active participation is usually encouraged in classes. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, they could disrupt the class. The problem is that the author's classmates are bothered, so maybe the quantity or timing of questions is an issue. The joke-making is another factor; if the jokes are inappropriate or frequent, they might be distracting.\n\nThe friend's comment about the teacher not appreciating questions not covered on tests suggests that maybe the author is asking questions that are outside the scope of the class, which could be seen as unnecessary. But the author mentions that the questions are on-topic, just sometimes related but not covered. That's a bit of a gray area. Teachers might prefer questions that stay strictly on the curriculum if time is limited.\n\nAlso, the social aspect is important. If others in the class are annoyed, the author might need to adjust their approach to be considerate. Maybe they could ask fewer questions during class and save some for office hours, or ensure jokes are appropriate and not disruptive. However, the author's intention is to learn and engage, which is valid.\n\nIn academic settings, participation is usually valued, but there's a balance. If the author is the only one participating, it's possible that they're doing more than necessary, and the peers might feel it's taking away from their learning environment. The key here is whether the questions are genuinely enhancing the class or causing disruption. If the teacher hasn't addressed it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the classmates' reactions suggest that the approach is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable for their learning style but are indeed causing disruption. The author isn't clearly wrong if their questions are on-topic and the teacher hasn't objected. However, the negative feedback from peers and the friend's report might indicate that the author needs to adjust, even if they're not entirely wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're trying to learn and engage, but others are annoyed, it's a bit of a nuanced situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their intention is positive and questions are on-topic unless the teacher objects. But some might argue that the frequency or type of questions is an issue, leading to A.\n"
