When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a computer science student is actively participating in class by asking questions and making jokes, but other students are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The author is upset and seeking advice.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points here are the student's intent to engage and learn, which is positive. They mention that their questions are on-topic and for clarification. However, the other students find this behavior annoying. The class has a very low participation rate, so the author is the only one interacting. The friend overheard comments about the author being annoying and making jokes that others find moronic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the questions are relevant and the jokes aren't disruptive, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, if the jokes are inappropriate or the questions are too frequent and off-topic, that could be an issue. The user mentions that the questions are sometimes about topics not covered on tests, which other students might see as unnecessary. But the author's intention is to clarify and learn, which is valid.\n\nIt's possible that the other students are envious or uncomfortable with someone being proactive in a passive environment. The teacher might not have set clear expectations for participation. The author isn't doing anything wrong by engaging, but maybe the way they do it could be adjusted. The key is whether the author is following the teacher's guidelines and if the participation is respectful. Since the questions are on-topic and the jokes are part of their interaction style, unless they're causing disruption, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem might be the class's negative reaction, but that doesn't mean the author deserves blame. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
