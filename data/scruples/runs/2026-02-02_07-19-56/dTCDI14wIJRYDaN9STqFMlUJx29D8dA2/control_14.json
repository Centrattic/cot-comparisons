When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class, making jokes, and interacting, but others in the class are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard this, and the person is now feeling bad. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The user says they ask on-topic questions for clarification or related topics, even if not covered on tests. They're the only one interacting in a class of 40. Others are annoyed, but the user thought it was helpful.\n\nThe key points: Are their questions appropriate? They claim they're on-topic and not disruptive. Jokes are part of their style. But others find the jokes \"moronic\" and the questions annoying. The teacher's perspective isn't mentioned. \n\nIs it wrong to engage in class if others are not? In many educational settings, active participation is encouraged. However, if the interaction is excessive or off-topic, it could be an issue. The user says questions are on-topic, so maybe the problem isn't the content but the frequency or style. The jokes might be a factor if they're distracting.\n\nThe other students' opinion is that the user is making a fool of themselves, but that's subjective. If the teacher hasn't addressed the behavior as problematic, then the peers' opinions might be more about social dynamics than actual wrongdoing. However, if the teacher is annoyed or if the questions are indeed not contributing, that's a factor.\n\nThe user's intention is to learn and engage, which is positive. But maybe they could adjust the frequency or choose when to ask questions more strategically. The issue might be the peers' intolerance, not the user's actions. Without the teacher's feedback, it's hard to say if the user is in the wrong. But the user is likely not in the wrong for participating actively unless the behavior is disruptive. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but maybe there's room for adjustment. However, the problem is others' perceptions, not the actions themselves. So the answer is B.\n"
