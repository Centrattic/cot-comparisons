When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a computer science junior who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. The issue is that other students are calling him annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" He's confused because he thought interacting was good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He's one of the few in a class of 40 who participates regularly. His questions are on-topic but sometimes about things not covered in exams. His jokes are described as \"moronic\" by others. The teacher hasn't mentioned any issues, but peers are upset.\n\nThe key points here are the impact on his learning versus others' perceptions. Participating in class can be beneficial for engagement and understanding. However, if his participation is distracting or not contributing meaningfully, that's a problem. The fact that others find him annoying suggests his method might be off-putting.\n\nHe says he asks questions to clarify or relate to topics. But if the questions aren't relevant or are too frequent, they might disrupt the flow. The jokes being \"moronic\" could be another issue\u2014maybe they're not well-received and take away from the class environment.\n\nHowever, the teacher hasn't indicated any problem, which is a positive sign. The teacher's role is to manage the classroom, so if they don't see an issue, the students' reactions might be unfounded. Still, the peers' feedback is valid as it affects the classroom dynamics.\n\nI need to decide if his actions are inappropriate. If he's genuinely engaged and not disrupting, maybe others are just envious or uncomfortable. But if his participation is excessive or off-topic, then he might need to adjust. The key is balance. Since the teacher hasn't said anything, it's possible he's in the right, but the peer reactions suggest adjustment might be needed. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since his intent is to learn and the teacher hasn't objected, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but he should consider the peers' feedback to adjust his approach.\n"
