When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a junior computer science student who's been actively asking questions and making jokes in class. Now, others are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard the comments, and one person confirmed it. The author is upset and seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The student is in a class where very few others participate, and they're one of only a few. They feel that interacting helps them learn, which is a valid point. Active participation is generally encouraged in education. However, the negative feedback from peers is real. The problem arises in whether their actions are actually inappropriate or if they're being unfairly criticized.\n\nThe key points here are the number of questions they're asking and the nature of the jokes. If the questions are on-topic and relevant, even if some aren't covered on tests, that might be okay. But if they're asking too many, it could disrupt the class or the teacher's flow. The friend mentioned that others find the jokes \"moronic,\" which suggests the humor might not land well or could be distracting. \n\nAlso, the term \"ass kisser\" implies that their questions are perceived as trying to impress the teacher rather than genuine curiosity. This can be a sensitive point. If the student's intent is to learn, then they're not in the wrong. However, if the questions are seen as excessive or insincere, others might find it annoying. \n\nI should also think about classroom dynamics. In a large class (40 students), if only one person is engaging, maybe the professor isn't encouraging participation. But the student isn't at fault for wanting to learn. The issue might be more about the peers' discomfort with someone being proactive. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the student is overstepping. If they're asking questions that the teacher finds irrelevant or if they're dominating the discussion, that could be problematic. But the student claims the questions are on-topic and for clarification. Unless the professor has explicitly said that participation is too much, the student's actions seem justified. \n\nThe emotional impact is significant. The student is feeling torn and questioning their approach. It's possible that the peers are jealous or uncomfortable because they themselves aren't participating. The student might be doing the right thing, but the peers are projecting their own insecurities. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If their questions are genuine and on-topic, and the jokes are just their way to engage, then probably not. The peers' reaction seems more like a social issue rather than the student's fault. However, if the questions are too frequent or the humor is not well-received, maybe there's room for adjustment. But the post doesn't indicate that the professor has criticized them, only the peers have. \n\nIn most academic settings, asking questions is a good thing. Unless it's done in a way that's disrespectful or disruptive, the student isn't in the wrong. The answer might depend on the balance between engagement and over-engagement. Since the student is one of the few participating, even if it's a lot, it's better than no one. The negative feedback from peers might just be a result of social dynamics and not a valid reason to stop engaging. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They should continue asking questions if it helps them learn, but maybe consider the timing and how others perceive their jokes. The answer is B.\n"
