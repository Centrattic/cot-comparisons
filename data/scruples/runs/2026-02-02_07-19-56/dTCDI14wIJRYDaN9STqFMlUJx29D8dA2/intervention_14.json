When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who actively participates in class by asking questions and making jokes. But now, other students are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard this and told the author, leading to self-doubt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a class of 40 where they're the only one participating. They ask on-topic questions for clarification or related topics. They thought it was fine until the negative feedback. The key points here are the intent behind the author's actions and how it's perceived by others.\n\nThe author's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive. However, the problem is that their participation is causing discomfort in others. The other students find it annoying, and the author is now being criticized for jokes labeled as \"moronic.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite good intentions.\n\nI should consider classroom dynamics. In a large class, if only one student is active, it might create a spotlight effect. Even if the questions are relevant, the frequency could be overwhelming. Also, the jokes might not land well if they're not tailored to the audience. The teacher's perspective isn't mentioned, but if the teacher encourages participation, the author is in the right. However, if the teacher is neutral or doesn't appreciate it, that's another angle.\n\nAnother angle is peer pressure. The author is trying to contribute, but in a passive environment, their actions might disrupt the class flow others are used to. The label of \"ass kisser\" suggests that others feel the author is trying too hard to please the professor, which could be perceived as ingratiating rather than genuine participation.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation is to learn and engage, which is commendable. It's possible they didn't realize the impact of their actions. The issue might be more about the peers' reactions than the author's actions. But if the questions are on-topic and the jokes are appropriate, maybe the author isn't at fault. Yet, if the jokes are seen as low-brow or distracting, that could be problematic.\n\nI should balance intent vs. impact. The author's intent is positive, but the impact is negative on peers. In such cases, adjusting behavior might be necessary even if the intent was good. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong but could benefit from self-reflection and adapting their approach. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the teacher hasn't addressed it, maybe the peers are being overly critical. But if the teacher also disapproves, then the author's actions are indeed a problem.\n\nSince the teacher's reaction isn't mentioned, focusing on the peers' reactions. If the class culture is passive, the author's active participation is a contrast. It's possible that the peers are envious or uncomfortable with someone taking initiative. The author isn't necessarily wrong for participating, but perhaps they need to adjust how they do it. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with a note to consider others' perspectives. But according to the user's initial thought, they leaned towards A. However, the correct answer might be B because the author's intent is positive, and they might need to adjust rather than being in the wrong inherently.\n"
