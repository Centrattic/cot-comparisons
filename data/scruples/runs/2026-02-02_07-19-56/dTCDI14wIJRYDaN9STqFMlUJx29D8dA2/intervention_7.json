When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a junior computer science student is asking a lot of questions in class and making jokes, which the professor seems okay with, but other students are calling him annoying and \"an ass kisser.\" The author is feeling bad because their friends told them others are upset.\n\nFirst, the author is engaging in class, which is generally a good thing. Asking questions can help both the student and others understand the material better. But the problem here is that other students are annoyed by the frequency and maybe the nature of the questions and jokes. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Impact on Others**: If the class size is 40 and the author is the only one interacting, their participation might be disrupting the class dynamic. However, if the questions are on-topic and relevant, it's usually acceptable. The issue is whether they're being disruptive or taking time away from the lesson.\n\n2. **Nature of Questions and Jokes**: The author mentions some questions are there just to clarify or ask about things not covered. If the questions are off-topic or not contributing to the lesson, that could be a problem. Similarly, if the jokes are inappropriate or distracting, that could annoy others.\n\n3. **Teacher's Reaction**: The author didn't mention the teacher's response. If the teacher is okay with the participation, then maybe it's appropriate. But if the teacher is annoyed, that's a different story. The peer's comment suggests the teacher might not appreciate the questions that aren't test-related.\n\n4. **Intent vs. Perception**: The author's intent is to learn and engage, which is positive. However, the perception from classmates is negative. Sometimes, even well-meaning actions can be perceived as annoying if they're not timed well or if they dominate the class time.\n\n5. **Class Norms**: In a class where others don't participate, the author might be trying to fill the silence, which is good. But if they're overdoing it, it could be seen as taking over. The balance here is crucial.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to participate and engage. However, there might be a need to adjust the frequency or type of questions and jokes to be more considerate of others' experiences. The problem might be more about how they're being received rather than the act of participating itself. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with a suggestion to adapt their approach.\n"
