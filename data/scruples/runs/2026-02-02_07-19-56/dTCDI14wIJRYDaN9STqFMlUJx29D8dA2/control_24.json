When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for asking a lot of questions in class. The author is a junior CS student who's the only one interacting in a class of 40. They mention that they ask on-topic questions, sometimes for clarification or related topics not covered. Their friends overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and someone told them their jokes are \"moronic\" and that the teacher doesn't appreciate the questions since they're not test material.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about classroom interaction. The author is trying to engage, which is generally encouraged, but others are reacting negatively. The main issue is whether the frequency or nature of the questions is inappropriate. The author clarifies that the questions are on-topic, so they're not off-topic distractions. They also use jokes to help with learning, but others find them moronic.\n\nI need to consider if asking a lot of questions in a class where most are passive is wrong. Active participation is usually a good thing, but maybe the quantity is an issue. If the questions are valid and on-topic, others might just be envious or uncomfortable with someone being proactive. Also, the teacher's perspective is important. If the teacher doesn't mind or even appreciates the interaction, then the classmates' opinions might be less relevant. However, the author was told the teacher doesn't appreciate questions not on the test, which could indicate that the questions might be too tangential or not aligned with the course's focus.\n\nThe jokes being called moronic are another point. Even if the author's intention is to make the class engaging, if the jokes are not well-received, that's a problem. But the author mentions the jokes help them learn, so maybe they're trying to make the class more enjoyable, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the classmates' reactions suggest the humor isn't landing well.\n\nThe author's motivation is to learn and engage, which is positive. But if the method is causing discomfort to others or not being effective in the teacher's eyes, there's room for adjustment. The key here is balancing participation with respect for others' comfort and the class's focus. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to engage, but perhaps the approach could use some refinement. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but with suggestions to adjust how they interact.\n"
