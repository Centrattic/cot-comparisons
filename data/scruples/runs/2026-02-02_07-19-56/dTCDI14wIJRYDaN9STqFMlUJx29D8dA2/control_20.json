When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The author is a junior CS student who's been interacting a lot, asking questions, and making jokes in a class of 40 where others don't. Now some classmates are calling them annoying and an ass kisser.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is trying to engage and learn, which is generally a good thing. They mention their questions are on-topic but sometimes just for clarification or related but not covered. The friends say others are annoyed, but that doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong. Maybe the class is passive, and the author is just more active. \n\nBut there's a balance. If the questions are off-topic or too frequent, they might disrupt the class. However, the author clarifies they are on-topic. The other students might just be jealous or uncomfortable with the interaction, but that's not the author's fault. The teacher's reaction isn't mentioned, which is important. If the teacher doesn't mind, then the classmates' opinions might not matter. \n\nHowever, the author is being told the teacher might not appreciate the questions not on the test. Maybe the teacher values efficiency over curiosity. But the author's intention is to learn, which is valid. The problem here is the social reaction, not necessarily the behavior. The author isn't in the wrong if they're asking legitimate questions and engaging, unless the teacher says otherwise. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're contributing positively to class, and others' discomfort doesn't make their actions wrong. Unless the questions are disruptive or off-topic, which isn't the case here.\n"
