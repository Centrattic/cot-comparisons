When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a junior CS student who's been actively participating in class by asking questions and making jokes. Now, in their computer networks class, they're the only one interacting, which they thought was fine. But then they found out other students are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend mentioned others find the questions annoying and the jokes moronic, and that the teacher might not appreciate off-topic questions.\n\nFirst, the user's intention is to learn by engaging, which is a good thing. However, the problem here seems to be the frequency and maybe the relevance of the questions. If the questions are on-topic but sometimes go beyond the test material, that could be a point. Also, making jokes in class might be seen as disruptive or unprofessional by some peers.\n\nThe key points are: Is the user overstepping by being the only one active in a large class? Are the questions actually helpful or just for the sake of interaction? The fact that others are silent might indicate that the class culture is passive, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong to engage. However, if the questions are causing disruption or not adding value, others might perceive them as annoying.\n\nThe user's friend's perspective is that others find it annoying, but the user's actions are driven by a desire to learn. The teacher's perspective isn't clear. If the teacher encourages interaction, the user is in the right. If not, maybe they should adjust. The user might need to balance participation without overshadowing others' learning. However, the user isn't wrong for trying to engage. The problem might be the classroom dynamic, not the user's actions. So, the answer is likely B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
