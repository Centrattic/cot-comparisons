When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a junior computer science student who started classes last week. They enjoy interacting in class by asking questions and making jokes, which helps them learn. In their new computer networks class with 40 students, they're the only one who speaks up regularly. All their questions are on-topic, sometimes for clarification or related topics not covered. However, some classmates called them annoying and said they're an \"ass kisser,\" making jokes deemed \"moronic.\" The author is now upset because they thought their interaction was helpful but now feel it's causing issues.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the student is engaging actively in class, which is generally a positive trait. However, in a large class where others don't participate, their active participation stands out. The classmates are reacting negatively, calling them annoying and making fun of their jokes and questions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, asking questions is usually encouraged in educational settings. It shows engagement and can help clarify concepts for others too. If the questions are relevant and on-topic, the student is doing something positive. The fact that they're the only one participating might indicate that others are not as engaged, not necessarily that the student is wrong. Also, making jokes could be a way to lighten the mood, but if the jokes are not well-received, that might be an issue. The term \"moronic\" suggests that the jokes didn't land well, which could be a problem in terms of social interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the frequency of questions is so high that it disrupts the class or if the jokes are distracting or not appropriate, it could be seen as problematic. However, the student mentions they ask questions for clarification and related topics. The term \"ass kisser\" implies that others think they're trying too hard to please the teacher, which might not be the case. The student's intention is to learn, not to flatter the teacher, but others might perceive it that way.\n\nAnother angle is the classroom dynamics. In a large class, most students might be introverted or not interested in participating, so the student's active role could be beneficial. However, if their participation is overwhelming others, that's an issue. The key here is whether the questions and jokes are respectful and not disruptive. If the teacher hasn't indicated any problem, then the student might be in the right. The classmates' reactions are their issue, not necessarily the student's fault.\n\nBut the problem arises if the student is overdoing it. For example, if they're asking too many questions that take away from the lecture time or if the jokes are inappropriate. The student says the questions are on-topic but sometimes relate to things not covered. If those questions are not useful to the class, maybe the classmates feel it's a waste of time. However, the student's intent is to learn, and the teacher's role is to address those questions if they're valid.\n\nIn terms of the jokes, if they're not well-received, maybe the student should consider the appropriateness. But the student might be trying to keep the class engaging, which is a good thing in a dry subject like computer networks. However, if the jokes are seen as childish, that's a social issue. The term \"moronic\" suggests that the jokes are not clever or are out of place. The student might need to adjust their humor to fit the class better.\n\nThe main conflict here is between the student's active participation and the classmates' discomfort. The student isn't in the wrong if their participation is respectful and contributing to learning. However, if their actions are causing unnecessary disruption or if the jokes are inappropriate, then they might need to adjust. But based on the information given, the questions are on-topic and the jokes are just for humor. The classmates' negative reactions are more about their own preferences than the student's actions being inherently wrong.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because their participation is a positive trait, and the classmates' reactions are their own issues. The student should perhaps be mindful of the frequency and appropriateness of jokes but isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
