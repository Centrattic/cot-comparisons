When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a student who's been actively asking questions and making jokes in class, but now others are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The author is wondering if they're doing something wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The student is in a class where very few others participate, so their interaction stands out. They mention asking on-topic questions for clarification or related topics, and making jokes to help them learn. The issue arises when peers start criticizing them for being annoying and the jokes being \"moronic.\"\n\nThe key points here are: participation style, peer reactions, and appropriateness of the questions and jokes. Active participation is generally encouraged, but if it's disrupting the class or not welcomed by the instructor, that could be a problem. However, the problem here is the negative reaction from peers, not the instructor. The teacher's perspective isn't mentioned, so that's a gap. \n\nThe student's intent is to engage and learn, which is positive. But the peers might feel the student is monopolizing the class time or making them feel uncomfortable. If the questions are relevant and helpful, even if not test-related, they're contributing to the learning environment. However, if the jokes are inappropriate or the questions are too frequent, they might be seen as disruptive.\n\nAnother angle: in a large class of 40, having one active participant can be beneficial for discussion. However, if the student is the only one engaging, it might create a dynamic where others feel pressured or think the student is showing off. The term \"ass kisser\" implies that some see the student as trying to impress the teacher, which could be the root of the peer's annoyance.\n\nThe student's friend overheard the negative comments, and another student confirmed them. The student is now questioning their approach. The question is whether the student is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent vs. perception. The student's intent is constructive, but the perception from peers is negative. Even if the student is doing something positive, the negative reactions suggest a problem. However, the student might not be in the wrong if their actions are within acceptable classroom behavior. The teacher's input is missing, though. If the teacher values participation and doesn't mind the questions, then the student isn't wrong. But since the teacher's stance isn't mentioned, it's hard to say. \n\nThe jokes being called \"moronic\" might indicate that the humor isn't well-received. If the jokes are inappropriate or not funny to others, that could contribute to the negative perception. The student might need to adjust the frequency or content of their jokes and questions to better align with the class's expectations. \n\nIn summary, while the student's intention is good, the negative peer reaction suggests that their approach might be causing issues. However, without the teacher's feedback, it's hard to definitively say the student is wrong. The student might need to self-reflect and possibly adjust their participation style without being entirely in the wrong initially.\n"
