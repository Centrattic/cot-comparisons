When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a junior CS student who started classes last week. They enjoy interacting in class, asking questions, and making jokes because it helps them learn. They mention that usually, only about three students interact, but in their new computer networks class with 40 students, they are the only one asking questions. All their questions are on-topic, sometimes to clarify or ask about related but not covered topics. Then a friend tells them others called them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" One person said the jokes are \"moronic\" and that the teacher might not appreciate the questions. The author is upset because they thought they were being helpful by engaging.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether their actions are justifiable. The author's intention is to learn and contribute, which is positive. But the problem is other students find it annoying. The question is if they're at fault.\n\nIn an educational setting, asking questions is generally encouraged as it fosters engagement and understanding. Even if they're the only one, it doesn't mean they're wrong unless they're disrupting the class. The user specifies the questions are on-topic and clarifications. So maybe the teacher appreciates that, but others don't like the attention. However, the author's behavior isn't inherently wrong. The other students might be envious or uncomfortable, but that's their reaction, not the author's fault.\n\nThe jokes being called \"moronic\" could be another angle. If the jokes are inappropriate or off-topic, that might be an issue. But the author didn't mention that the teacher or others found the jokes problematic beyond the perception of some students. Also, the term \"ass kisser\" might imply that others think they're trying too hard to please the teacher, which could be a social issue rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the author's actions are in line with active participation, which is good for learning. The negative reactions from peers are unfortunate but don't necessarily make the author wrong. Unless the teacher explicitly said not to ask questions, the author isn't at fault here. They might need to adjust their approach if it's causing disruption, but based on the info given, they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
