When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for asking a lot of questions in class. The situation is that the student is a junior in computer science, taking a computer networks class where they're the only one interacting, asking questions, and making jokes. Their peers are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" so the author is upset and seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions they are one of three students in other classes who interact, which they've considered normal. In this particular class, they're the only one. The questions are on-topic, sometimes for clarification, sometimes related but not covered. The teacher isn't mentioned as being unhappy, just the classmates. The friend overheard students saying they're annoyed and made a comment about not appreciating the jokes. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are their intention versus the impact. The author's goal is to engage, learn, and contribute, which is generally a positive trait. However, the classmates perceive it as annoying. The issue might be about volume or timing of questions, or the jokes being off-putting. But the author states the questions are on-topic and for clarification, which should be valid. The problem arises from the peers' reactions, not necessarily the teacher's.\n\nIn academic settings, participation is usually encouraged, so asking questions is a good practice. However, if it's disrupting the class or if the teacher feels it's distracting, that could be a problem. But there's no mention of the teacher being annoyed here. The classmates' judgment seems harsh, especially if the questions are legitimate. The jokes being called \"moronic\" might indicate that the humor is not well-received, but the user might need to adjust their style there.\n\nThe peer reactions are subjective; others might not be used to someone being so active. Maybe the class culture is more reserved. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to participate, but perhaps they could consider the delivery of jokes or frequency of questions. However, the core action\u2014asking questions to engage and learn\u2014is not the problem. The negative reactions are from peers, not the instructor, which suggests it's more about social dynamics in the class rather than academic misconduct.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because participating and asking questions are good, and the peers' reactions are their issue. The author might need to adjust their approach if they're overdoing it, but the intent and action aren't inherently wrong. The key is that the teacher isn't mentioned as being against it, and the author's behavior is within academic norms. The social friction is unfortunate but doesn't place the blame on the author.\n"
