When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who asks a lot of questions in class, which is otherwise very quiet. The classmates are now calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The author is upset because they thought their participation was helpful, but now feels like maybe they're overdoing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The class has 40 students, and the author is one of the few who participates. They mention their questions are on-topic but sometimes just to clarify or ask related topics not covered. The friend overheard others saying they're annoying and making jokes that are \"moronic.\" The person they confronted said the teacher might not appreciate the questions that aren't test-relevant and that the author looks stupid asking for clarification.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: participation in a quiet class, the nature of the questions (some not test-related), and the jokes being perceived as moronic. The author's intention is to learn and engage, but the classmates are annoyed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI should consider if asking questions in class is generally seen as a good thing. In most academic settings, participation is encouraged, especially if the questions are relevant. However, there might be a line where asking too many questions, even if on-topic, could disrupt the flow of the class. The author mentions that the class is usually quiet, so their participation might stand out more. The classmates might feel that the author is getting special attention from the professor, which could make others uncomfortable. \n\nBut the author says the questions are on-topic. If they are clarifying points or exploring related topics, that's usually a positive. However, if some questions are not covered on tests, maybe the professor is focusing on material that's test-related, and the author's questions might be seen as off-topic or unnecessary. Also, the jokes being \"moronic\" could be a problem if they're distracting or not appropriate.\n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are genuinely disruptive or if they're just standing out in a class where others don't participate. The author's intention isn't to annoy but to learn and engage. However, the perception of others is that they're annoying. Is it the author's fault for participating, or is it the classmates' issue? \n\nIn some cases, being the only one to participate might make others feel left out or embarrassed for not participating. The term \"ass kisser\" suggests that the classmates think the author is trying too hard to please the professor, which could be a negative perception even if the author isn't intentionally doing that.\n\nBut the author's actions might still be in the right if they are contributing positively to the class. The problem might lie in the classmates' reactions rather than the author's behavior. Unless the questions are off-topic or disruptive, the author isn't in the wrong. The joke part is a bit iffy\u2014maybe the jokes are not well-received, but if they're part of the interaction to make the class more engaging, it's debatable.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because participating and asking questions is generally good, but there might be a need to adjust the frequency or content of the questions if they're not test-related and causing disruption. The author might need to find a balance, but the initial action isn't necessarily wrong. The classmates' reactions might be due to their own insecurities or lack of participation.\n"
