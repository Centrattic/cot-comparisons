When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking a lot of questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior computer science student who interacts a lot in class, asks questions, and makes jokes. Their peers are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and even saying their jokes are \"moronic.\" The author is confused because they thought interacting was good for learning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they're one of three students who usually interact in classes, which suggests that in most cases, their questions are appreciated. In this particular class, it's a computer networks course with 40 students, and the author is the only one asking questions. That's a big difference. The author mentions the questions are on topic but sometimes relate to things not covered. The teacher might not be covering all the material the author is curious about, leading to questions that others might find irrelevant.\n\nThe friends overheard others saying they're annoying. The key points here are whether the questions are appropriate, if they're disruptive, and if the author's intent was to help their learning or to show off. The author mentions that the questions are to clarify or explore related topics, which seems genuine. However, in a large class where others aren't participating, maybe the frequency of questions is overwhelming. If the teacher is okay with it, maybe the students are just jealous or uncomfortable with someone being active. But if the teacher doesn't mind, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nAlso, the jokes being called \"moronic\" could be a factor. If the humor isn't well-received, that might be part of the issue. But the main concern is the questioning. The author isn't causing harm; they're trying to engage and learn. The other students might feel the author is getting more attention, leading to resentment. However, the teacher's role is to facilitate learning, and active participation is generally encouraged unless it's disruptive. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions are genuinely hindering others or disrupting the class. If the questions are on-topic and the teacher allows it, the author is probably not in the wrong. The peers' reactions might stem from their own discomfort with being active participants. The author isn't showing off but trying to engage, so they're not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
