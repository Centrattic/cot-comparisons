When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a junior computer science student who's been the only one asking questions in class and making jokes. Now, some classmates have called them annoying and used derogatory terms. The author is upset and seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are inappropriate. The key points are that the author is engaging in class, which is generally a good thing. Asking questions to clarify or explore topics is usually encouraged. However, the problem arises when classmates perceive these actions as annoying. The author mentions that the questions are on-topic but sometimes not covered in tests. The friend says others think the jokes are \"moronic\" and that the teacher might not appreciate the questions.\n\nNow, the core issue here is balancing participation with the preferences of others. If the author is the only one participating, it's possible that their questions are redundant or not well-received. However, the author's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive. The fact that others are upset might be due to social dynamics rather than the author being wrong. In a class of 40, maybe the others are shy or don't care to participate. The teacher's reaction isn't mentioned, which is crucial. If the teacher supports the author's participation, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the teacher also finds it disruptive, that's a different story.\n\nThe author's actions might be causing discomfort among peers, but unless they're disruptive or off-topic, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The class environment should encourage engagement. The author isn't violating any rules; they're trying to be proactive. The classmates' reactions could be envy or just not wanting to participate themselves. The author should consider the teacher's perspective and maybe adjust their approach if it's not effective, but they're not inherently wrong for trying to engage. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
