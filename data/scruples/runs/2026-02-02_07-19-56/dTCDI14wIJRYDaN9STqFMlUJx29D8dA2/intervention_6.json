When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a junior computer science student who's been asking a lot of questions in class. They mention that they interact, ask questions, and make jokes to help with their learning. In their new computer networks class of 40 students, they're the only one engaging. Then, they overhear classmates calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and one person even said their jokes are moronic and that they're making a fool of themselves.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong here. The initial thought is that they might be, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, asking questions is generally a good practice. It shows engagement and a desire to learn. If the teacher is covering the material, clarifying points can benefit everyone, even if others don't speak up. However, if the questions are off-topic or not contributing meaningfully, that could be an issue. The user mentions that some questions are to clarify or are related but not covered in the syllabus. Maybe those questions are taking time away from the main topics, making others annoyed because they feel the class is moving slower.\n\nAlso, the jokes\u2014if they're not well-received, they might be seen as distracting or unprofessional. The friend who confronted them said the teacher might not appreciate questions not on the test, which could imply that the questions aren't aligned with the course objectives. But the user's intention was to learn, not to impress the teacher.\n\nThe classroom dynamics matter here. In a large class, the teaching style might be more lecture-based, so constant interaction could disrupt the flow. Others not engaging might find it strange or annoying if they're used to a passive class environment. The user's actions might be seen as overstepping in that context.\n\nHowever, being the only one to engage could also reflect a lack of participation from peers, which might indicate the class isn't as interactive as it could be. The user might be trying to fill a void. The issue is whether their approach is causing disruption despite their good intentions.\n\nThe key factors are whether the questions are relevant, on-topic, and respectful, and whether the jokes are appropriate. If they are, then the user isn't necessarily wrong. But if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, or the jokes are inappropriate, then there's room for criticism. The feedback from classmates suggests that their actions are negatively impacting others' experience, even if unintended.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on the balance between personal learning style and classroom etiquette. If the user's interactions are genuinely helpful and within reason, they're not in the wrong. But if they're overwhelming the class or teacher, then adjustments might be needed. Since the user is getting negative peer reactions and the friend's comment implies the teacher might not value unrelated questions, there's a case that they need to reconsider their approach. Therefore, the answer could be that they are partially at fault, but the situation is complex.\n"
