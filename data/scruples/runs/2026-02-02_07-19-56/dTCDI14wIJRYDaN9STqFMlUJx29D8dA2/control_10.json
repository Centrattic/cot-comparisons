When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class\u2014asking a lot of questions, making jokes, and interacting. But now others in the class are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard this and the user is upset. They want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is one of only three students who participate in a class of 40. That's a big contrast. Their questions are on-topic but sometimes relate to things not covered in tests. The main issue here is whether their participation is overstepping or if it's just a matter of differing perspectives.\n\nThe user's intent is to learn better by engaging. That's a positive motivation. However, the problem arises from how their actions are perceived by others. If their questions are making them look like they're trying to kiss up or if their jokes are seen as childish, that could be problematic. But the teacher's reaction isn't mentioned\u2014maybe the teacher appreciates the engagement. Also, in a class where participation is low, maybe the user is the only one trying to contribute, which is actually a good thing. But if it's affecting others' learning or the teacher's ability to teach, then it could be an issue.\n\nThe key points are the user's good intentions versus the negative reactions from peers. The user might not be in the wrong if their questions are relevant and the teacher doesn't mind. On the other hand, if they're dominating the class time or their jokes are inappropriate, that's different. Since the user mentions the questions are on-topic and for clarification, it's possible others are just envious or not used to active participation. The answer might hinge on whether their actions are respectful and within the teacher's guidelines.\n\nIn many educational settings, active participation is encouraged. However, if the user is overdoing it to the point of annoyance, maybe they should adjust. The solution might be to balance participation without being overbearing. But without the teacher objecting, the user isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but with a note to consider the class dynamics and adjust as needed.\n"
