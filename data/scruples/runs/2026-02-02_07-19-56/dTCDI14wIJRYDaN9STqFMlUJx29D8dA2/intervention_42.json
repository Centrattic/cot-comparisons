When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The scenario is that the student is a junior in computer science and in a class where they're the only one participating. They ask on-topic questions, sometimes for clarification, and even make jokes to engage. But other students have called them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" with one person saying their jokes are \"moronic\" and that the teacher might not appreciate the questions not covered in tests.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are the student's intentions versus the reactions of others. The author is trying to engage and learn, which is a good thing, but maybe overdoing it? However, the student is part of a class where others don't participate, which could mean their questions are actually beneficial for everyone, even if others aren't vocal. \n\nOn the other hand, the classmates are annoyed. They might feel the student is seeking attention or taking up time that could be used for other things. The term \"ass kisser\" suggests they perceive the student as trying too hard to please the teacher, which could be a motive the student didn't intend. The jokes being called \"moronic\" might indicate that the humor is off-putting or not well-received.\n\nBut is the student in the wrong? If the questions are on-topic and not disruptive, asking for clarification is actually a positive learning behavior. The problem might be the volume of questions or the timing, but the story doesn't specify that the student is being disruptive. If the teacher hasn't addressed it, maybe the classmates' complaints are unfounded. However, if the student is making the class environment uncomfortable for others, that's a different issue.\n\nThe student's intention is to learn and engage, which is generally a good thing. The classmates' negative reactions might stem from their own discomfort with participation or jealousy. The key is whether the student's actions are impeding others' learning or the teacher's ability to teach. If the questions are constructive and the jokes are light-hearted, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the jokes are inappropriate or the questions are frequent to the point of derailing the class, that could be an issue. The story doesn't mention the teacher's reaction, which is important. If the teacher hasn't said anything, maybe the classmates' opinions are just their own and not valid. \n\nIn academic settings, active participation is usually encouraged. So the author's behavior is probably justified. The problem might be the peers' negative response rather than the author's actions. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if the questions are truly appropriate and if the jokes are in bad taste. The author says the questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification, so they seem okay. The jokes are described as \"sometimes to help me learn,\" which might be lighthearted. Unless the jokes are offensive, they shouldn't be a problem. The term \"moronic\" could be a subjective judgment by the classmates. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are positive, and their actions seem aligned with good classroom participation. The classmates' negative feedback might not be valid unless the author is indeed overstepping. Since the author isn't described as disruptive, the answer is probably B.\n"
