When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class, which is in a computer networks course. They mention that they're one of the few students who interact, ask questions, and sometimes make jokes to help them learn. Now, in this new class, there are 40 students, and the author is the only one asking questions or responding. The questions are on topic but sometimes just for clarification or related but not covered. Then, the author overheard classmates calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" A friend confirmed that others find the jokes \"moronic\" and think the author is making a fool of themselves, with the teacher possibly not appreciating the off-topic questions.\n\nThe author is upset because they thought their interaction was good for learning and didn't realize others found it annoying. They want to know if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the positives. The author is engaged in class, which is a good thing. They're trying to learn by asking questions and making connections. In many educational settings, participation is encouraged. If the questions are on topic and relevant, even if they're for clarification or extending beyond the test material, it's part of the learning process. The fact that they're one of the few in a large class asking questions might indicate a lack of engagement from others, not necessarily a problem with the author.\n\nHowever, there's a negative perspective. The classmates find it annoying, and the author's jokes are considered \"moronic.\" The friend suggests that the teacher might not appreciate the questions not covered on tests. So, maybe the author is overdoing it or their style isn't well-received. But is that their fault? If they're not disruptive and the questions are relevant, maybe the issue is with the classmates' attitudes. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, that could be a problem.\n\nThe key points to consider: Are the questions relevant and on-topic? The author says they're on topic but sometimes related but not covered. If they're not disrupting the class and the teacher doesn't object, then the author isn't in the wrong. The problem might be the classmates' intolerance for someone being engaged. However, if the author is making the teacher uncomfortable or the questions are too frequent, then maybe they should adjust.\n\nAlso, the jokes being \"moronic\" suggests that the humor isn't well-received. Maybe the author should be more mindful of the class's tone. But the main issue is the questions. If the author is doing what they can to engage and learn, and the teacher hasn't indicated any problem, then the classmates' complaints might be unfounded. However, the fact that the teacher might not appreciate the off-topic questions could be a point against the author.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are in line with classroom norms. If the teacher hasn't addressed it, and the questions are relevant, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the questions are too many or off-topic, then maybe. But the scenario doesn't say the teacher has said anything. The author's intention is to learn, which is positive. The classmates' reactions might stem from envy or not wanting to engage themselves. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
