When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior computer science student who's been told that their classmates find them annoying for asking too many questions in class. They interact a lot, make jokes, and sometimes ask questions that aren't directly on topic. Now, they're feeling bad because others called them an \"ass kisser\" and \"moronic.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user's intentions seem positive. They want to engage, learn, and contribute. That's a good start. They mention that they're one of the few who participate, which might mean they're actually helping the class by asking questions others are too shy to ask. However, the feedback from classmates is that it's annoying. That's a tricky part.\n\nNow, the key here is the balance between engagement and overdoing it. If the questions are on-topic and for clarification, that's usually encouraged. But maybe the user is asking too frequently, or the jokes are falling flat. The friend mentioned that the teacher might not appreciate questions not relevant to tests, which could be a point. If the teacher hasn't addressed the behavior, it's hard to say if the students are justified. But if the class is mostly silent, the user's participation might be necessary, and the peers' reactions could be out of jealousy or discomfort with being challenged.\n\nHowever, the user's actions are causing others to feel the need to label them negatively. The teacher's perspective is missing here, but the user hasn't been told directly by the teacher to stop. So, maybe the user isn't in the wrong, but they should consider the class dynamics. Perhaps they can adjust the frequency or timing of their questions, or gauge the teacher's reactions more. The classmates' reactions might stem from their own disengagement or discomfort with someone else being active. In that case, the fault isn't entirely the user's. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a caveat to consider others' feelings and adjust if necessary.\n"
