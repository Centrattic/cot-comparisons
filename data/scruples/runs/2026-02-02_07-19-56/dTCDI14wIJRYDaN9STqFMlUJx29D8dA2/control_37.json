When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a junior CS student who's been active in class, asking questions and making jokes. Most students don't participate, but the author finds it helps them learn. Recently, they overheard classmates calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend confirmed that others find the questions and jokes annoying, and that they might be making a fool of themselves.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for engaging so actively. The user's reasoning is that they thought their participation was helpful and normal, but others are upset. The key factors to consider are the nature of the questions, the context of the class, and the perception of others.\n\nFirst, the questions are on-topic and for clarification. That's generally a good thing in an educational setting. However, if some questions are about things not covered in tests, that might be where others get annoyed. But the author mentions that they ask for clarification, which is valid. The problem might be the frequency or the perception that the teacher isn't appreciating it. If the teacher hasn't indicated disapproval, then the classmates' opinions might be subjective.\n\nThe jokes are another point. If the jokes are \"moronic,\" as cited, maybe they're not landing well. However, humor can be subjective. The author's intention was to aid learning, but if the jokes are off-putting, that's a valid concern. Still, unless the teacher or the class structure has specific guidelines against it, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe class size is 40, with only the author participating. In such a setting, the author's engagement could be beneficial, as it keeps the class dynamic. However, if the author is dominating the interaction time, others might feel it's taking away from their participation. But in a class where no one else is asking, the author's role is to keep the conversation going. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are disruptive or if they're fulfilling a personal learning need without overstepping. Since the questions are relevant and the teacher hasn't intervened, it's more likely the author isn't in the wrong. The classmates' opinions are their own, but the author isn't violating any academic rules. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
