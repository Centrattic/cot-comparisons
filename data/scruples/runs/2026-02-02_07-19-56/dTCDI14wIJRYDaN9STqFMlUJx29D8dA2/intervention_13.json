When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a computer science student who's been active in class, asking questions and making jokes. Now they're being criticized by classmates for being annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The user is asking if they're in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that they're one of the few students interacting in a class of 40. That's significant. If no one else is engaging, maybe the teacher would appreciate the interaction. But the classmates are annoyed because the user is the only one participating. That could create tension.\n\nThe questions the user asks are on-topic but sometimes not covered in tests. The problem here might be that the classmates think these questions aren't helpful for exams. However, the user is trying to clarify and learn, which is generally a good thing. If the teacher is okay with it, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But if the teacher is annoyed or if the questions are off-topic, then maybe the user is overstepping.\n\nThe jokes are described as \"moronic\" by classmates. If the jokes are in poor taste or not welcomed, that could be an issue. But if they're light-hearted and meant to engage, maybe not. The user's intention is to help themselves learn by interacting, which is positive, but the impact on others is negative.\n\nThe key factors here are the teacher's reaction and the nature of the questions and jokes. If the teacher hasn't said anything, the user might not be in the wrong. But if the classmates are being disrespectful, that's a different issue. The user might need to find a balance between participating and not overwhelming the class. Maybe adjusting the frequency or timing of questions could help. Overall, it's a complex situation where the user's intentions are good, but the execution might need tweaking. So, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong, but there's room for adjustment.\n"
