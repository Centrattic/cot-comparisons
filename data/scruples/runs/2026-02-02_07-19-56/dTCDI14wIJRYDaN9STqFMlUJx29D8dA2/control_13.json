When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class, making jokes, and interacting with the teacher. They mention that in their new computer networks class, no one else does this, and they're the only one. Their friends overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" One person even said their jokes were \"moronic\" and that the teacher isn't appreciative of their off-topic questions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are their intention to engage and learn by asking questions, which they find helpful. They clarify that their questions are on-topic but sometimes just to clarify or ask something not covered. The issue arises because others in the class are not participating, leading to the author being the sole contributor, which might be causing discomfort.\n\nThe author isn't disrupting the class, just asking questions. However, the fact that others are labeling them as annoying and making negative comments suggests that maybe their approach isn't well-received. But is that their fault? The teacher's role is to manage the class effectively. If the author's questions are helping them learn and not hindering the class, then they might not be at fault. However, if the questions are off-topic or too frequent to the point of disturbing others, that's a problem. But the author mentions they're on-topic. \n\nThe author's jokes being called moronic is another point. Maybe their humor isn't landing well, but that's subjective. The main issue is the perception by others. However, the core of the problem is the author trying to engage in a class where others are disengaged. The author isn't the one making the class silent; others are not participating. So, the author's actions, while maybe not perfect in terms of social dynamics, are not necessarily wrong if they're contributing to their own learning and the teacher allows it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the teacher is only interested in test material and the author is asking questions outside of that, the teacher might not appreciate it, leading others to think the author is trying too hard. But the author isn't being disruptive. They're just using their learning style. The fact that others are upset might be more about their own lack of engagement rather than the author's actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They should perhaps adjust their approach if the teacher asks, but based on the information given, they're not wrong for trying to engage and learn.\n"
