When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a junior CS student is the only one interacting in class\u2014asking questions, making jokes\u2014and now classmates are calling him annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" He's upset because he thought he was helping himself learn by engaging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're trying to stay engaged, which is good for learning. They're the only one participating, which might mean the professor needs to encourage more interaction. But the classmates are annoyed. Maybe they feel he's taking up time or that his questions are unnecessary. The friend says others think his jokes are \"moronic\" and that he's asking questions not covered in tests.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, asking questions is generally encouraged in education. Maybe the way he asks questions or the frequency is the issue. If he's asking a lot, maybe it's disruptive. But the post says the questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification. The problem might be the perception from others. If the class is large (40 students) and he's one of the few, maybe others are used to not participating, so his active participation stands out. The term \"ass kisser\" suggests others think he's trying too hard to impress the teacher, which might not be the case. However, his jokes being called \"moronic\" could indicate they're not well-received.\n\nIs he in the wrong? If he's genuinely trying to learn and the questions are appropriate, then no. But if the questions are off-topic or too frequent, they might be annoying. The key is balance. The fact that the students are annoyed but he's trying to engage is a conflict. The teacher's perspective matters too. If the teacher appreciates the interaction, maybe the author is right. But if the teacher is annoyed, that's different. Since the author doesn't mention the teacher's reaction, we can't say for sure. However, the assumption is that the professor would appreciate the engagement since it's part of learning.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The classmates' annoyance is more about their own discomfort with someone else being active. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
