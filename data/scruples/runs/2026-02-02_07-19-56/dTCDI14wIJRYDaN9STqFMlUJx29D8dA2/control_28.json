When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a junior computer science student who's been asking a lot of questions in class, making jokes, and interacting, which has made others in the class label them as annoying or an ass-kisser. The friend overheard this, and the student now feels torn up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were inappropriate. The student is in a class of 40 where only they and a few others interact. They say their questions are on-topic, sometimes for clarification or related topics not covered. The teacher hasn't said anything, but other students have expressed annoyance. \n\nThe key points here are the impact on others and the context. The student's intention is to engage and learn, which is generally positive. However, if their questions are frequent to the point where others find it annoying, even if the questions are legitimate, it might be affecting the class dynamics. The jokes being called \"moronic\" could be an issue if they're distracting or not well-received. \n\nBut the teacher hasn't mentioned any problem, which is a good sign. The teacher's role is crucial here; if the teacher appreciates the questions and the interaction, then it's probably okay. However, the student's behavior might be disrupting others. If the questions are taking up too much time or causing the class to drag, that's a problem. But the student says they ask clarifying or related questions, which can be helpful. \n\nThe friends' reactions are negative, but peer opinions can be subjective. It might be that in a large class, others aren't as engaged, so someone who does participate might stand out. The term \"ass kisser\" suggests others feel the student is trying too hard to please the teacher, which could be a perception issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be overdoing it if their actions are genuinely hindering the class or making others uncomfortable. However, if the teacher is okay with it and the questions are constructive, the student's actions are justified. The answer depends on the balance between their engagement and the class's tolerance. Since the student is trying to learn and the teacher hasn't objected, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But there's a need to consider moderation and perhaps adjust based on others' feedback without becoming defensive.\n"
