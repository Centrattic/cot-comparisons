When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a student who asks a lot of questions in class and is now being called annoying by classmates. The author is confused because they thought interacting was good for learning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The student is a junior in CS, which is a field that often requires active participation and problem-solving. They mention that they're one of three students who usually interact in other classes, but in this computer networks class, they're the only one. The teacher probably appreciates the engagement since it helps with understanding complex topics.\n\nThe friends overheard other students calling the author annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend who confronted the author said others find the questions annoying, the jokes moronic, and that the teacher might not appreciate non-test-related questions. The author is now feeling bad and seeking validation.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, asking questions is generally a positive trait. It shows engagement and a desire to learn. However, there's a balance. If the questions are too frequent to the point they disrupt the class or if they're off-topic, that could be an issue. The author mentions that some questions are related but not covered in tests. Maybe the class is focused on test content, so those non-test questions could be seen as irrelevant.\n\nAlso, making jokes in class can be hit or miss. If the jokes are inappropriate or disrupt the learning environment, they might be frowned upon. The author says the jokes help them learn, but others find them moronic. That's a point against the author. The key is intent vs. perception. The author's intention is good, but others are negatively affected.\n\nThe teacher's perspective is important. If the teacher encourages questions, then the author is doing the right thing. If the teacher is annoyed or if the questions are off-topic, then maybe the author should adjust. But since the author hasn't received feedback from the teacher directly, it's hard to judge. The classmates' opinions are negative, but peer reactions can sometimes be influenced by jealousy or misunderstanding.\n\nIn academic settings, participation is often encouraged. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, it might be unproductive. The author should consider if their questions are genuinely helping the class or just taking up time. The jokes might be a separate issue; if they're not relevant, they could be distracting.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking questions, as it's a good learning practice. However, they might need to be more mindful of the context\u2014asking questions that are on-topic and relevant to the class material, and being cautious with jokes that might not land well. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a note to adjust based on feedback.\n"
