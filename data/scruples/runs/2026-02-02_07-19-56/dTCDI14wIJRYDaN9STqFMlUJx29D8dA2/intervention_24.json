When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The author is a junior CS student who interacts a lot, asks questions, and makes jokes in a class where others don't participate. His friends overheard others calling him annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" which is making him feel bad. He wants to know if he's doing something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is actively participating in a class where most students are quiet. His questions are on-topic but sometimes go beyond what's covered, and his jokes are mentioned as \"moronic\" by others. The key points here are about the appropriateness of his participation and the reactions of his peers.\n\nActive participation is generally a positive trait, especially in learning environments. It can foster engagement and deeper understanding. However, if the questions are excessive or off-topic, they might disrupt the flow of the class. The fact that others are not participating might make his actions stand out more, which could lead to negative perceptions if not balanced properly.\n\nThe author mentions that his questions are sometimes just to clarify or ask about related topics not covered. If these questions are relevant but not essential, they might be seen as unnecessary by peers who are focused on the core material, especially if they're preparing for tests. The students' reaction could stem from frustration that the class is moving slower or that the teacher is spending time on non-exam topics.\n\nThe jokes being called \"moronic\" might also contribute to the negative perception. If the humor is not well-received or seems forced, it could make others uncomfortable or annoyed, especially in a class where most are serious.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to engage and learn, which is commendable. The issue might lie more in the delivery or frequency of questions and jokes rather than the act of participating itself. The feedback from peers is important, but it's also possible they're projecting their own disengagement or discomfort with active discussion.\n\nThe teacher's perspective is crucial. If the teacher encourages participation, then the author is likely in the right. If the teacher doesn't appreciate the extra questions, that's another factor. The author should consider whether his questions are genuinely helpful or if they're disrupting the class.\n\nIn summary, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting to engage and learn, he might need to adjust the frequency or nature of his questions and humor to better align with the class's expectations and the teacher's preferences. The peers' negative reactions could be due to social dynamics in a passive class environment, but the author's actions aren't inherently wrong. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) but with a note about possible adjustments.\n"
