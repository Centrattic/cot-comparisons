When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a junior CS student taking a computer networks class. They like to ask a lot of questions in class, which is the only interaction happening because the class has 40 students and only three usually interact. The author is one of them, but they end up being the only one in this new class. Their friends tell them that other students are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and that the teacher might not appreciate their questions, especially if they're not test-related.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They believe that asking questions helps them learn and that they're doing something good. They're trying to engage in class, which is usually a positive thing. But others in the class are annoyed. The problem here is the social dynamics. In a large class, maybe the other students feel that the author is taking up too much time or that the questions aren't contributing to the class. The teacher's perspective is also important. If the questions are on-topic and helpful, maybe the teacher appreciates it. But if they're off-topic or redundant, the teacher might not. The friend mentioned that the questions that aren't covered on tests make the author look stupid, so maybe those questions aren't useful to the class.\n\nThe author's jokes being called \"moronic\" could be another issue. If the jokes are inappropriate or not well-received, that might contribute to the negative perception. But the user's main point is about the questions. The key is whether the author's actions are reasonable. They are trying to participate, which is good, but maybe overdoing it in a large class where others are not participating. The author might need to balance their participation so it's not overwhelming for others. The teacher should be the main authority here. If the teacher doesn't mind, then the author isn't wrong. But if the teacher also finds it disruptive, then the author might need to adjust.\n\nHowever, the author isn't told directly by the teacher, just by classmates. Classmates might have a biased view, wanting to feel less isolated if someone else is participating. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they could benefit from adjusting their approach if it's actually causing issues. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because asking questions is generally encouraged, but maybe they should consider the context and the teacher's feedback. But since the teacher hasn't said anything yet, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the classmates' feedback is valid, maybe they should adjust. Hmm, tricky.\n"
