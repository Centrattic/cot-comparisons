When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. They're the only one interacting in a class of 40, and now some classmates are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend confirmed others think their jokes are moronic and that they're making a fool of themselves by asking unnecessary questions.\n\nFirst, the person's intention is to engage and learn, which is good. Asking questions is usually encouraged in educational settings. However, the problem arises from how the classmates are reacting. If the questions are on topic but sometimes not covered in tests, maybe the classmates feel it's irrelevant. But should asking clarifying questions be discouraged? Maybe the student is overdoing it, but the key point is whether their actions are genuinely in the wrong.\n\nThe term \"ass kisser\" might imply that they're trying too hard to impress the teacher, which could be seen as insincere. However, if the student is genuinely seeking understanding, that's not their fault. The jokes being called moronic might be a separate issue. If the jokes are inappropriate or disruptive, then maybe they should adjust. But the user mentions they find jokes help them learn, so unless they're offensive, it's a personal choice.\n\nThe main issue is the social dynamics. In a class where others don't participate, being the only one to do so can make others uncomfortable. They might feel the student is receiving undue attention. However, it's not the student's fault that others are disengaged. The student's actions are not inherently wrong; they're trying to engage. The problem is the classmates' negative reaction. The teacher's perspective is also important. If the teacher appreciates the interaction, then the student is doing the right thing. The friend's account says the teacher doesn't appreciate the off-topic questions, but if those questions are clarifications, maybe the teacher would still value them.\n\nIn conclusion, the student isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are participating, which is beneficial for their learning. However, they might need to adjust the frequency or relevance of their questions to align better with the class's expectations. The real issue is the classmates' judgment, not the student's actions. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
