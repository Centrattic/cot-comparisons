When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The author is a junior computer science student who's been actively participating in class by asking questions and making jokes. However, some classmates have called them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" which is hurting the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The class has 40 students, and the author is one of only three who interact regularly. The questions are on-topic but sometimes clarify things not covered in tests. The author's friend reported overhearing negative comments from others. The key points here are: the author is trying to engage, but others find it annoying. \n\nI should evaluate if the author's actions are actually problematic. If the questions are on-topic and aimed at clarification, that's generally positive. However, if the teacher hasn't encouraged participation or if the questions are off-topic, that might be an issue. The author mentions that some questions are related but not covered, which could be seen as irrelevant. Also, the jokes are described as \"moronic\" by others, which might be a problem if they're distracting or not well-received.\n\nBut the author's intention is to learn and engage, which is good. The negative opinions of peers could stem from jealousy or frustration that the teacher is addressing someone else in a class where they don't participate. If the teacher appreciates the questions, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the questions are excessive or disruptive, that's a different story. The answer might hinge on whether the teacher supports the author's participation. Since the author isn't told directly by the teacher that they're overdoing it, the classmates' opinions might not be the best measure. \n\nAnother angle: in a large class, the teacher might rely on active students to fill in silence. The author's participation could help others learn indirectly. But if the questions are too frequent or not well-prepared, others might get annoyed. The jokes part is tricky; if they're inappropriate or disruptive, that's a problem. But the author says they're to help with learning. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not. They're trying to engage and learn, which is positive. The classmates' negative reactions could be sour grapes or not understanding the value of participation. However, if the author is overdoing it to the point of disruption, that's a problem. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the participation is genuine and on-topic. But if the questions are unnecessary or the jokes are off-putting, maybe A. The key is whether their actions are respectful and contribute to the learning environment. Since the questions are on-topic and clarifications, and the teacher hasn't indicated a problem, the author is likely in the right. So answer B.\n"
