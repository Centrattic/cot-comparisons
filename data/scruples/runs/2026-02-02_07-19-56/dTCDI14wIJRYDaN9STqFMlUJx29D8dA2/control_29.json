When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class, leading to being called annoying and other negative things.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is a junior CS student in a class of 40. They interact a lot, ask questions, and make jokes, which they find helps them learn. The problem arises because other students find this behavior annoying, even going as far as calling them an \"ass kisser\" and their jokes \"moronic.\" The author is confused because they thought interacting was good for learning.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent is to engage and learn, which is positive. However, the impact is negative on peers. But is the author wrong? Well, interacting and asking questions is generally encouraged in educational settings. It shows engagement and a desire to understand the material. However, if the questions are off-topic or too frequent, that could be problematic. The author mentions the questions are on-topic or clarifications, which is good. The jokes are part of the interaction but might not land well with everyone.\n\nThe friends' reactions suggest that the author's behavior is perceived negatively. But in a class where most students are passive, having someone active might be beneficial. The teacher hasn't mentioned anything, which is important. If the teacher appreciates the interaction, then the author is doing the right thing. The peers' opinions might stem from jealousy or discomfort with active participation in a typically quiet class. The author isn't doing anything wrong just for engaging; the issue could be more about the peers' attitudes than the author's actions.\n\nAlso, making jokes in class can be a double-edged sword. If the jokes are appropriate and help lighten the mood, they might be fine. But if they're deemed \"moronic,\" maybe the humor isn't landing. However, the author doesn't say the jokes are inappropriate, just that they find them helpful. The problem here is that others don't appreciate the humor, but that's subjective.\n\nIn educational contexts, participation is usually encouraged. Unless the author is disrupting the class or the teacher is against it, their actions seem justified. The friends' negative comments might be a reflection of their own insecurities or a desire to conform to a passive class environment. The author shouldn't change their behavior just because some peers are unhappy unless there's a valid educational reason from the instructor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions are positive for their own learning and the class environment, assuming the instructor doesn't object. The peers' reactions are more about their own discomfort or jealousy rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
