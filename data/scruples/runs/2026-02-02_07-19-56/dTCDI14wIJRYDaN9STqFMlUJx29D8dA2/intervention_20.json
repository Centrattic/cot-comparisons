When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class, making jokes, and interacting with the teacher. They're the only one doing this in a class of 40. Now, some classmates are calling them annoying and making fun of their jokes and questions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification. That's good for learning. But maybe they're asking too many, which could disrupt the class or make others uncomfortable. Also, the jokes being \"moronic\" might not be well-received. However, the author's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive.\n\nI should think about classroom dynamics. If the teacher appreciates the interaction, then it's probably okay. But if the teacher hasn't said anything, maybe the author isn't aware they're overdoing it. The friends' comments suggest peers are annoyed, but that doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong. Maybe the peers are just envious or not engaged.\n\nAnother angle: is the author's behavior respectful? If the questions are relevant and not disruptive, then it's likely appropriate. However, if the jokes are distracting or the questions are too frequent, that could be an issue. The author should check if the teacher finds it helpful or not, but since the teacher hasn't mentioned it, maybe the peers' negative reactions are just their own opinions.\n\nIn academic settings, active participation is usually encouraged. So the author might not be in the wrong. The key is balance. If the author is the only one contributing, maybe they should gauge the teacher's response or adjust their style slightly to be more considerate of others' preferences. But being the only one to participate might be expected in a large class where others are passive.\n\nSo, the author's intentions are good, but maybe they need to adjust their approach. However, the negative feedback from peers might be more about their own discomfort rather than the author being wrong. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
