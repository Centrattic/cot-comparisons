When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The context is a junior CS student who's been told by classmates that their interactions are annoying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The student is engaging in class, which is generally encouraged for learning. They mention asking on-topic questions to clarify or explore related topics. The problem arises from classmates finding it annoying and calling them names. The friend overheard that others think the author is an \"ass kisser\" and their jokes are \"moronic.\"\n\nThe key points here are: the author is trying to participate, which is positive, but the classmates are reacting negatively. The teacher hasn't said anything, which is important. Also, the author's intent is to learn and interact, not to disrupt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the questions are on-topic and the teacher hasn't indicated any issue, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, if the questions are excessive or off-topic, that could be a problem. The author mentions some questions might not be covered on tests, but if they're still relevant to the course, maybe that's okay.\n\nThe classmates' reactions might stem from their own disengagement. If most students aren't participating, the author's active role could make others uncomfortable. But that doesn't make the author wrong for participating. The teacher's perspective is crucial here. If the teacher appreciates the participation, then the author is doing the right thing. If the teacher finds it disruptive, then maybe they should adjust. But since the author hasn't been reprimanded by the teacher, it's possible the issue is with the peers' attitude.\n\nThe author's jokes being called \"moronic\" is another angle. If the humor is inappropriate or disruptive, that's a different matter. But the author thought it helped with learning, so maybe the timing or content of the jokes is the issue. However, the main concern is the questions, not the jokes.\n\nIn conclusion, unless the teacher has explicitly stated that the author is overstepping, the author isn't in the wrong for participating. The problem might be the classmates' intolerance for active participation. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
