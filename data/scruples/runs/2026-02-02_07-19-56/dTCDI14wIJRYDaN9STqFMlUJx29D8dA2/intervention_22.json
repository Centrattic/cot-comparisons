When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a student who asks a lot of questions in class, which is otherwise very quiet. The student is told by peers that they're being annoying and called names like \"ass kisser\" and that their jokes are \"moronic\". The student is now doubting themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The student is in a class where very few others participate. They're trying to engage, which is usually seen as a positive thing. Asking questions can help in understanding the material, and sometimes even if others don't ask, the teacher might appreciate the questions for the benefit of the entire class. However, the classmates are upset because they find it annoying. The student's jokes might be coming off as forced or not appropriate, but they thought it helped them learn.\n\nNow, the key points are: the questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification, even if not directly relevant to exams. The classmates' reactions are negative, but does that mean the student is wrong? Maybe the student is overdoing it, but the intention is to engage and learn. The teacher hasn't said anything, so maybe the problem is with the peers' perception. \n\nOn the other hand, if the questions are too frequent, they might disrupt the flow of the lecture, even if they're on-topic. The jokes could be distracting. However, the student is the only one participating, so the peers might not be used to active engagement. Sometimes, in large classes, a few students take the initiative. The negative reactions from peers might be due to jealousy or discomfort with the student's active role. \n\nThe teacher's perspective is important. If the teacher appreciates the questions, then the student is doing the right thing. The teacher might be using the student's participation to guide the class. The student isn't in the wrong if their actions are helping the class or themselves learn, unless they're being disruptive. The classmates' criticism might be unwarranted. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The student is engaging in a way that helps them learn, and the peers' reactions might be negative but don't necessarily make the student wrong. Unless the teacher explicitly says the questions are a problem, the student is justified in their actions.\n"
