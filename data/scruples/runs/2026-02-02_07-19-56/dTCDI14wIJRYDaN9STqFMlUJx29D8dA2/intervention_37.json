When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class, leading to negative reactions from peers.\n\nFirst, the author is a junior CS student. They mention that they like interacting, asking questions, and making jokes to help their learning. In a class of 40, they're the only ones doing this. Their friends overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend confirmed that others find the questions annoying and the jokes moronic, saying the teacher might not appreciate non-test-related questions and the author looks stupid.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they thought their interaction was helpful but now feel criticized. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, asking questions is generally good for learning, but maybe the quantity and timing could be an issue. If the teacher didn't express any issues, maybe the problem is the peers' reaction. The author's intention was to engage and learn, which is positive. However, if the questions are off-topic or not contributing to the class, peers might get annoyed. The jokes being called moronic could also be a problem if they're distracting or not well-received.\n\nBut from the scenario, the author's questions are on-topic and for clarification, which is valid. The main issue seems to be the peers' perception. The teacher hasn't mentioned it, so maybe the problem is with the classmates, not the author. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They should maybe adjust their approach slightly, like timing or ensuring questions are relevant, but the intention is good. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
