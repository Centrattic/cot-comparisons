When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking a lot of questions in class. \n\nFirst, the author is a junior computer science student who actively participates in class, which is something he believes helps him learn. He's in a class of 40 where he's one of the few who speaks up, and he's been told by peers that others find him annoying and a \"kisser.\" The peers also mentioned that the teacher might not appreciate questions not covered on tests.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is engaging in class, which is generally encouraged. However, the problem arises because his peers are annoyed, and they think his questions are unnecessary or not test-related. The teacher's perspective isn't shared, but the students claim the teacher doesn't appreciate it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From an academic standpoint, asking questions is usually seen as a good thing because it shows engagement and curiosity. However, if the questions are off-topic, disruptive, or too frequent, they might be seen as a distraction. The author mentions that his questions are on-topic but sometimes related to things not covered. If the teacher hasn't addressed those points during lectures, maybe the students feel they're not necessary. \n\nAlso, the social aspect: being the only one speaking might make others uncomfortable. The author's jokes are called \"moronic,\" which could indicate that the humor isn't well-received. Maybe the tone or frequency of his jokes is an issue. However, the author's intention is to aid his learning, which is valid.\n\nIn many educational settings, participation is encouraged. But there's a balance. If the questions are too numerous and slow down the class, or if the humor is distracting, that could be a problem. Since the peers are the ones annoyed, but the teacher's reaction is unclear, it's hard to say. The author might need to adjust his approach\u2014maybe ask fewer questions, focus on those that are crucial, or engage in other ways. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If the teacher hasn't reprimanded him and the students are the ones who are annoyed, but the author is trying to learn, it's possible he isn't in the wrong. However, if the teacher has indicated that the questions are not appropriate, then maybe. Since the teacher's perspective isn't given, it's ambiguous. But generally, active participation is a positive trait, so the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, the way he's doing it might need adjustment. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), because he's trying to engage and learn, but there's room for him to modify his approach to be more considerate of the class's needs and the teacher's focus on test content.\n"
