When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior computer science student who actively participates in class, but in a new course with a large class size, they're the only one interacting. Their friends overheard others calling them annoying and making negative comments.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to learn and engage, which is positive. They mention that their questions are on-topic and sometimes just for clarification. The problem seems to stem from other students' reactions. The key points here are whether the author's actions are inappropriate or if the other students are just being passive-aggressive.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong by asking clarifying questions. In a classroom, interaction is encouraged. The fact that others are not participating might be an issue of their own. However, if the questions are off-topic or too frequent, that could be a problem. The author mentions that some questions are related but not covered in tests, which might be a point. But if the teacher didn't object, maybe it's okay.\n\nThe friends' comments suggest a toxic environment where others are uncomfortable with active participation. The teacher's reaction isn't mentioned, which is important. If the teacher appreciates the interaction, the author is doing the right thing. If not, maybe the author should adjust. But based on the info given, the author's actions are in line with good classroom participation. The other students might be envious or passive, not the author at fault. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
