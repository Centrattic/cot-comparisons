When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a computer science student who interacts a lot in class by asking questions and making jokes, but now other students find it annoying.\n\nFirst, the key points: The student is in a class of 40 where they're the only one asking questions. Their questions are on-topic but sometimes to clarify or ask about related things not covered. Friends overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The student feels bad and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nLet me think about the dynamics. The student's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive. They mention that interacting helps them learn, which is valid. However, the problem arises from the peers' reactions. If others find the questions annoying, maybe the student is overdoing it. But what's the line between helpful questions and too many?\n\nThe student says their questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification. If the teacher allows questions and the student is not disrupting the class, maybe they're not wrong. But if the questions are redundant or not contributing, peers might get annoyed. Also, the jokes being called \"moronic\" suggest that maybe the humor isn't well-received.\n\nHowever, the student isn't intentionally trying to annoy others. They thought their behavior was normal. The issue might be about peer sensitivity rather than the student being wrong. In many classes, active participation is encouraged, but if the majority is silent, the student might be the only one engaging, which isn't bad. The problem could be the classmates' negative reaction rather than the student's actions.\n\nBut the student should consider if their questions are necessary or if they're just filling silence. Maybe some questions could be asked after class or via email to avoid disrupting the lecture. However, the student isn't doing that. They're just asking when they need clarification.\n\nThe teacher's perspective is important too. If the teacher appreciates the engagement, then it's justified. If not, maybe the student should adjust. But since the student hasn't been reprimanded by the teacher, it's possible the teacher doesn't mind. The negative comments come from peers, not the instructor.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the student might be in a class where others are shy or disengaged. The student's actions might push peers out of their comfort zone, leading to resentment. But that doesn't make the student wrong. The responsibility might lie with the peers to be more accepting of active participation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the student should adjust their approach slightly, like asking questions that are more directly relevant to the material or saving some for office hours. But the story doesn't indicate that the questions are off-topic or disruptive. The key is whether the student's actions are actually hindering the class. If the teacher isn't objecting, it's hard to say the student is wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the student's intentions are good, and their actions aren't necessarily wrong. The problem is the peers' negative reaction, not the student's behavior itself. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
