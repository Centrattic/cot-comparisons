When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior CS student who has been asking a lot of questions in class, which is new for them because it's their first time in a computer networks class. They mention that they're one of the few who interact, and they thought it was okay. But now, their friend overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend also said that the other students think the jokes are moronic and that the author is making a fool of themselves.\n\nThe user is wondering if they're in the wrong. They feel bad because they believed their participation was helpful and part of their learning process. From the description, the questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification or related topics not covered. The jokes are part of their interaction style. The main conflict is between the author's intention to engage and learn versus the classmate's perception of them as annoying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In a class of 40 with only a few interacting, the author is trying to fill that gap. Asking questions is generally seen as a positive trait because it shows engagement. However, maybe the frequency is too high? If they're asking so many questions that it disrupts the class or the teacher, that could be problematic. But the user says they're on-topic and related, so maybe not. The term \"ass kisser\" implies that others think they're trying too hard to please the teacher, which can be off-putting. But the author's intention is to learn, not to flatter the teacher. \n\nThe jokes being called moronic might be a problem if they're not appropriate or are distracting. However, the author might be using humor to create a more relaxed environment. The key here is whether the questions and jokes are impeding the class or if the other students are just uncomfortable with the author's active participation. \n\nAlso, the fact that others are not participating might lead to jealousy or resentment. The author isn't doing anything that's explicitly against the rules, but their behavior is out of the norm. It's possible that some students might feel the author is getting undue attention, but that's not a valid reason to be annoyed if the questions are legitimate. \n\nThe author's friend mentioned that others think the teacher doesn't appreciate their questions. If the teacher hasn't indicated any issue, then the classmates' opinions might be unfounded. The author should probably check in with the teacher to see if their questions are helpful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong based on the peers' reactions. \n\nSince the author's actions are on-topic and aimed at learning, unless they're overstepping boundaries, they might not be in the wrong. The classmates' reactions could stem from their own disengagement or discomfort rather than the author's behavior being inherently wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong if their questions are relevant and their jokes aren't offensive. Classmates' criticism might be due to their own lack of participation or misunderstanding the author's intentions.\n"
