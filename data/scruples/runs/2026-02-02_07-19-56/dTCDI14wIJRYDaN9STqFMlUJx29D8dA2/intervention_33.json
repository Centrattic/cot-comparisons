When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class. They feel they're helping themselves learn by interacting, but others in the class are calling them annoying and making jokes about them. The friend confirmed that some students think their questions are unnecessary and their jokes are bad. The user is upset and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points: the user is proactive in asking on-topic questions to aid their learning. They're in a class of 40 where almost no one else participates. Their questions are sometimes for clarification or related but not test-covered. The negative feedback from peers is affecting them emotionally.\n\nNow, considering if the user is in the wrong. The main issue is whether their participation is appropriate. Asking questions is generally a positive thing, especially in academic settings. The user is engaging, which can be beneficial not just for them but potentially for others who might have similar questions. However, the problem arises if the questions are disruptive or off-topic. The user mentions the questions are on-topic but sometimes about things not covered. But if it's for clarification or related topics, that's reasonable.\n\nPeer reactions might be more about envy or discomfort with someone who's more engaged. In a large class, the teacher might appreciate the interaction, especially if others are passive. The user's jokes being called \"moronic\" could be a separate issue. If the jokes are inappropriate or distracting, that's different. But the user says they're trying to help their learning, so maybe the jokes are light-hearted. However, if the jokes are falling flat, that's on the user to adjust.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong. Active participation is usually encouraged. However, if the questions are too frequent or the timing is off, it could be problematic. The user should consider if their questions are constructive and if their jokes are appropriate. Also, the peer reactions might stem from their own disengagement rather than the user's fault. The user's intentions are positive, so unless the questions are disruptive, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
