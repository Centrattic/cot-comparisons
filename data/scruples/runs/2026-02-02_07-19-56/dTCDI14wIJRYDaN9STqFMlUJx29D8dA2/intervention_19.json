When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. They thought it was okay since they were helping themselves learn, but now their peers are calling them annoying and making negative comments. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is asking questions that are on topic, which is generally a good thing for learning. Engaging in class is usually encouraged. But maybe the frequency is an issue. If the class size is 40 and only 3 students usually participate, the author's active role might stand out more. The other students aren't used to it, so their reaction could be due to discomfort with someone else's active participation.\n\nThen there's the issue of jokes. The user mentions making jokes to help them learn, but others find them \"moronic.\" That's a problem. If the jokes are off-topic or not well-received, they might be distracting and could contribute to the negative perception. However, the user's intention was to aid their own learning, so it's a mix of good and maybe not-so-good elements.\n\nThe other students' reactions are important too. People might feel uncomfortable if they're not used to someone else being so engaged. It's possible that the author's participation is making others feel inadequate or not in the same way. But that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The teacher's perspective is also key. If the teacher appreciates the questions and the interaction, then the author is doing the right thing. The user isn't told the teacher's reaction, but the friend mentioned the teacher doesn't appreciate the \"non-test-related\" questions. That's a point against the author if the teacher feels they're off-topic.\n\nSo, considering all factors: on-topic questions are good, but if they're too frequent or not aligned with the course objectives, they might be seen as disruptive. The jokes being a problem is a red flag. The author's intention is positive, but the execution might need adjustment. The answer hinges on balance. If the questions are genuinely helpful and the jokes are not interfering, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the questions are excessive or the jokes are a distraction, then they might be. However, the scenario doesn't specify that the questions are actually disruptive. The friend's opinion isn't proof of the teacher's feelings. So, the author might not be in the wrong if their participation is constructive. But the jokes and possible over-questioning could be areas to adjust. The answer is B (not in the wrong) because the core of their participation (asking relevant questions) is positive, and the negative reactions from peers don't necessarily mean the author is wrong, especially if the teacher isn't objecting.\n"
