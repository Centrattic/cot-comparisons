When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a computer science student who's been actively participating in class by asking questions and making jokes. They're the only one doing so in a class of 40, which might explain why others are annoyed. The friends overheard some classmates calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The person is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the intention behind the questions and the context. The user says the questions are on-topic, sometimes for clarification, and sometimes related but not covered. Their goal is to learn better by interacting. However, others perceive this as excessive and annoying. The teacher hasn't said anything, which is important. \n\nIn academic settings, participation is generally encouraged, but it's also about balance. If the questions are genuine and not disruptive, they should be okay. However, if the class is supposed to be lectures where only a few ask questions, being the sole participant might be seen as overstepping. But the user isn't interrupting; they're asking when appropriate. \n\nThe jokes might be the issue. If they're not well-received, they can come off as inappropriate or disruptive. The user's friends mentioned that others find the jokes \"moronic,\" which suggests they're not landing well. \n\nHowever, the friends' opinions are just that\u2014opinions. The user isn't doing anything wrong if their actions are respectful and on-topic. Unless the teacher has addressed the issue, it's more about the classmates' intolerance rather than the user's fault. The user's intention is to engage and learn, which is valid. The problem might be the classmates' inability to handle active participation without being critical. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They're trying to be engaged, which is positive. The issue lies with the classmates' reactions, not the user's actions. Unless the teacher has a problem, the user should continue as they are. The answer is B.\n"
