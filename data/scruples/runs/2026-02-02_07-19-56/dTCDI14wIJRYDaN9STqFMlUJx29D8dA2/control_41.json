When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior CS student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. They're the only one participating in a class of 40, which they thought was okay. But now, other students are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and the author is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are whether their actions are inappropriate. The questions are on-topic and for clarification, even if not directly covered in tests. Participating actively is usually encouraged. But maybe they're overdoing it? The problem is the classmates' reaction. However, just because others are annoyed doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong. \n\nThe author's intention is to learn and engage, which is positive. The jokes being called \"moronic\" could be an issue if they're unprofessional or distracting. But if the jokes are light-hearted and not offensive, they might just be a difference in perception. \n\nThe main issue is the social aspect. In a large class, maybe others don't appreciate the constant interaction, but the teacher's perspective is important. If the teacher encourages questions, the author is probably fine. If the teacher is annoyed, then it's a problem. \n\nSince the author is the only one participating, they might be fulfilling the class's need for engagement, but others might feel it's forced. The key is balance. The author should check if their questions are constructive and if the jokes are appropriate. Since the teacher hasn't said anything, maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because their intent is good and the teacher hasn't indicated a problem. The classmates' reactions are negative but not necessarily justified. Unless the questions are disruptive, the author isn't wrong.\n"
