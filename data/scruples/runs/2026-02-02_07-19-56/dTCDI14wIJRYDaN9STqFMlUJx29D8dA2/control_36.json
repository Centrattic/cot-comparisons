When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. Now they're worried they're being annoying based on what others said.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're in a class of 40 where they're the only one participating. Their questions are on-topic but sometimes about things not covered in tests. Their friend overheard others calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The person is now doubting their approach.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. \n\nThe user says they ask questions to clarify and sometimes about related topics. They mention that the questions are on-topic. The problem comes from peers finding it annoying and the friend relaying that the teacher might not appreciate off-topic questions. \n\nBut here's the thing: engaging in class is generally seen as positive. Active participation helps the student learn and can also benefit others by encouraging discussion. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, they could be seen as disruptive. The user mentions that some questions are about things not covered on tests, which might be why others are annoyed. \n\nHowever, the user's intention is to learn and interact, which is a good thing. The fact that others are not participating might be due to shyness or different learning styles. It's possible that the author's actions are causing some discomfort, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The teacher's perspective is crucial here. If the teacher is okay with the questions and even encourages them, then the author is in the right. If the teacher is annoyed, then maybe the author should adjust. But according to the scenario, the teacher hasn't said anything negative, only the peers.\n\nAlso, the term \"ass kisser\" implies that others think the author is trying too hard to please the teacher. But maybe the author is just being proactive. It's possible that the peers are jealous or find the author's approach unnecessary for their own learning style. However, the author's actions don't seem malicious. They're trying to engage and learn, which is good. \n\nOn the other hand, making jokes that others find \"moronic\" might be the part that's more problematic. If the jokes are distracting or inappropriate, that could be an issue. But the user says they're trying to help their learning, which might be a good intention, but maybe the jokes aren't well-received. \n\nIn terms of the number of questions, if they're overwhelming the class or the teacher, that's a problem. But the user is in a class of 40 where no one else participates, so maybe the teacher would rather have someone asking questions than silence. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention is positive. The problem seems to come from peers' reactions, but unless the teacher has indicated that the author is overdoing it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might need to adjust the frequency or type of questions if they're causing disruption, but based on the information given, the author's actions are justified for their own learning and engagement. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
