When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a junior CS student who frequently asks questions and makes jokes in class, which is the only interaction in a large lecture. His classmates called him annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and he's feeling torn up about it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from different angles. The author's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive. He's the only one participating, which might be because others are shy or the class is passive. But the classmates are upset. Are they justified? Well, asking on-topic questions is generally good, but maybe the frequency is too high. If the questions are off-topic or not relevant, that's a problem. The post mentions some are to clarify or relate but might not be covered on tests. If the teacher doesn't mind, maybe it's okay. But if the teacher is annoyed, that's another story.\n\nJokes in class can be hit or miss. If the jokes are inappropriate or disruptive, they could be an issue. The author says they're \"moronic\" according to classmates. The term \"ass kisser\" suggests others think he's trying too hard to please the teacher. That could be a social issue more than a factual one.\n\nThe key points: The author is helping himself learn by engaging, which is good. But in a large class, maybe the dynamic is different. If others don't participate, the author's actions might make them feel he's getting attention they want. Also, if the teacher appreciates the engagement, that's a plus. But if the teacher is annoyed, that's a problem.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if his questions are respectful and on-topic. However, maybe he's overdoing it or the jokes are unappreciated. The classmates' reaction might be jealousy or misunderstanding. The author should consider the context and maybe adjust the frequency or type of questions and jokes to fit the class culture better. But fundamentally, engaging in class isn't a bad thing unless it's disruptive. So the answer is more likely B (No), he's not in the wrong. But there's room for improvement in approach.\n"
