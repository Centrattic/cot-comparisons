When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a junior computer science student who actively participates in class by asking questions and making jokes. However, other students are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" which is affecting the author's self-esteem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both the author and the classmates. The author believes that participating in class helps them learn and that it's okay to ask questions. They mention that only about three students interact in their usual classes, so they thought it was normal. But in this particular computer networks class with 40 students, they are the only one interacting. The friends overheard others criticizing the author, saying their jokes are \"moronic\" and that they're making a fool of themselves.\n\nThe key points to evaluate here are: Is active participation in class considered problematic? Are the author's questions and jokes appropriate? The author states that the questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification or related but not covered topics. The jokes are made to aid learning. However, the classmates perceive this as annoying and unhelpful.\n\nIn academic settings, participation is generally encouraged. Asking questions can foster a better understanding and create a more engaging environment. However, if the questions are frequent enough to disrupt the class or if the humor is inappropriate, that could be an issue. The author mentions that the questions are on-topic but sometimes not test-related. It's possible that some classmates feel the questions are unnecessary or that the jokes are distracting.\n\nThe problem arises when the author's behavior starts to affect others negatively. If the teacher hasn't indicated any issues and the author's participation is within normal bounds, then the classmates' reactions might be unwarranted. Peer criticism in such a scenario might stem from jealousy or discomfort with someone being active in a typically quiet class. However, if the author is overdoing it, such as asking too many questions that aren't helpful or making jokes that are off-topic, then there's a valid concern.\n\nThe author's intent is to engage and learn, which is positive. The criticism from peers could be a reflection of their own discomfort with an active participant in a passive environment. However, the fact that the author is the only one participating might lead to others feeling that their contributions are being overshadowed. It's possible that the classmates are not used to such interaction and could be projecting their discomfort onto the author.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the nature of their participation. If they are respectful, on-topic, and not disrupting the class, then the criticism from peers might be unfounded. The teacher's perspective is also crucial. If the teacher appreciates the engagement and hasn't mentioned any issues, then the author is likely in the right. The negative feedback from peers might stem from their own biases rather than the author's actual wrongdoing.\n\nIn summary, unless the author's participation is disruptive or inappropriate, they are not in the wrong. The classmates' reactions could be due to their own discomfort or misunderstanding. The author's actions are aimed at enhancing their learning experience, which is a valid approach unless it's causing actual harm to the class environment.\n"
