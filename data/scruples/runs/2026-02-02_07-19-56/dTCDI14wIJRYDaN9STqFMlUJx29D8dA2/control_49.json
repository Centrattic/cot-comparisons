When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is a junior CS student who's been active in class, asking questions and making jokes. His classmates are calling him annoying and an ass kisser. The main issue is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, he's in a class of 40 where he's the only one participating. That's unusual, but maybe he's just more engaged. He says his questions are on-topic and for clarification, but some might not be covered on tests. The friends overheard others criticizing him as annoying and making jokes they think are moronic. \n\nFrom his perspective, he's trying to learn by interacting. But others see him as disruptive. The teacher hasn't said anything, but the students have. The author is upset because he thought his engagement was positive.\n\nNow, the question is if he's in the wrong. Being the only one asking questions could be a problem if it's interrupting the flow or if the questions are off-topic. But the user mentions they're on-topic. However, if the class is large and others aren't participating, maybe his actions are making him a target. Also, the jokes\u2014maybe they're not well-received. \n\nBut is he wrong for wanting to engage and learn? If his actions are genuinely helping him learn and the teacher hasn't objected, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the class is negatively affected or others are being annoyed, that's a different angle. \n\nThe key points are: his intent is positive (learning), but others are put off. The teacher hasn't commented, so maybe the students' reactions are just their personal opinions. But if he's overdoing it, even with good intentions, maybe he should adjust. But the core of the question is whether he's wrong. Since the teacher hasn't intervened, and his actions are on-topic, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, if the jokes are inappropriate or the questions are too frequent, maybe A. But the user says the questions are on-topic and for clarification. So B might be the answer here.\n"
