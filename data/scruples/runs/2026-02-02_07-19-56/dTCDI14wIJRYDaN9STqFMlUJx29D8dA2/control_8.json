When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who interacts a lot in class, which is a big contrast to the other 40 students who don't. They got feedback from classmates that they're being annoying and called names like \"ass kisser\" and that their jokes are moronic. The author is upset and wants to know if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is engaging in class, which is generally encouraged. However, the classmates' reactions suggest that their behavior might be perceived negatively. The key points here are: the author is the only one interacting, their questions are on-topic but sometimes not test-related, they make jokes, and the teacher's possible reaction is mentioned.\n\nThe author's intention is to learn by interacting, which is positive. But if the questions are not relevant to the tests, maybe some classmates see it as unnecessary. Also, making jokes could be distracting or not well-received. However, the author isn't doing anything that's obviously wrong. The main issue is the perception by others, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nI should think about classroom dynamics. If the teacher encourages participation, then the author is acting appropriately. But if the teacher hasn't set clear guidelines, the author might not realize if their questions are off-topic or too frequent. However, the fact that the classmates are upset doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong. It could be that the classmates are uncomfortable with someone being proactive in a passive environment.\n\nAnother angle: is the author respectful in their questions and jokes? If the questions are on-topic and the jokes aren't disruptive, then it's hard to say the author is wrong. The problem might be the classmates' intolerance for someone engaging in a class where others don't. Maybe the author is just more active, which isn't inherently bad unless it's to the point of derailing the class.\n\nAlso, the teacher's perspective matters. If the teacher appreciates engagement and the author's questions help clarify for others, then the author is doing the right thing. But if the teacher is annoyed, then it's a problem. However, the author hasn't mentioned the teacher's reaction, just what classmates said.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are in line with active participation, which is generally good for learning. Unless the questions are disruptive or irrelevant, the author isn't in the wrong. The classmates' negative reaction might stem from their own discomfort with someone being engaged in a passive class. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
