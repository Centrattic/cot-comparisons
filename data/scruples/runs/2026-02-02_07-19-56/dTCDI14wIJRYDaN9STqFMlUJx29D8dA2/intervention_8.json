When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The author is a junior CS student who interacts a lot in class, thinking it helps them learn. Their classmates, however, find it annoying and even call them an \"ass kisser\" and \"moronic.\" The friend overheard this and relayed it to the author.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is acting inappropriately by engaging so much. The author's intention is to learn by asking questions and making jokes to stay engaged. The problem comes from the classmates' reactions. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the classroom environment. If the author is the only one participating, maybe their presence is a positive thing, encouraging interaction. However, if they're overwhelming the class with too many questions, perhaps some are off-topic or not helpful, that could be a problem. The author mentions that sometimes the questions are about things not covered, which the classmates might find irrelevant.\n\nBut wait, the author says all questions are on-topic. Still, the classmates think that the questions not covered on tests are stupid. So maybe the issue is that the author is focusing on material not relevant for the tests, which others find unnecessary. However, the author's goal is to learn, not just to pass tests. That's a valid educational approach for some, though others might prioritize test prep more.\n\nThe jokes being \"moronic\" could be a red flag. If the humor isn't landing well and is making others feel it's disrespectful or unprofessional, that might be why peers are upset. But if the jokes are light-hearted and part of a comfortable classroom dynamic, maybe not. The author might not realize the jokes are seen as inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle: in a class of 40, if no one else is participating, the author's interaction might be necessary. However, if their questions are taking up too much time or disrupting the flow, others might feel it's affecting the class. The teacher's reaction is also a factor. If the teacher appreciates the engagement, then the author is acting correctly. If not, maybe they should adjust.\n\nThe author is clearly distressed and wants to know if they're in the wrong. The key here is whether their actions are objectively wrong or if the issue is more about differing opinions on classroom dynamics. The classmates' judgment might be influenced by their own lack of participation. Maybe they feel embarrassed that the author is the only one contributing, hence the negative labels.\n\nIn academic settings, participation is usually encouraged. However, balance is key. If the author's questions are excessive or off-topic, that's a problem. But if they're on-topic and helping the class understand, then it's a positive. The fact that a friend overheard negative comments suggests the author's approach might need tweaking, but isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intent is good\u2014they want to learn and engage. The problem arises if their methods are causing discomfort. The answer might hinge on the appropriateness of their questions and jokes. If they're respectful and on-topic, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the questions are too frequent or the jokes are in poor taste, maybe they need to adjust. However, the classmates' reactions could also stem from jealousy or insecurity. Without more context on the specific questions and jokes, it's hard to say definitively. But given the information, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to engage and learn actively.\n"
