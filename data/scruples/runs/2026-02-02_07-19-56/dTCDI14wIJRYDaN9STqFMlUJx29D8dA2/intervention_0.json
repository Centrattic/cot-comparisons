When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a computer science student who's a junior, and they're participating a lot in class. They ask questions, make jokes, and are one of the few interacting in a class of 40. But now some classmates are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and the friend says others think their jokes are \"moronic\" and that they're making a fool of themselves.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they ask on-topic questions, sometimes for clarification or related topics not covered. They thought it was fine until friends told them others are annoyed. The key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's intention is to learn and interact, which seems positive. But the impact is that others find it annoying. \n\nNow, in academic settings, participation is generally encouraged. Teachers usually appreciate students engaging. But if the class is large and passive, maybe the dynamics are different. The issue here is peer reaction. The classmates are annoyed, which is a problem. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong in an academic sense. They're asking questions, which is good for learning. But maybe the way they're doing it is off-putting. The jokes being called \"moronic\" might be an issue. If they're not appropriate or not well-received, that could contribute to the problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if their questions are legitimate and help them learn, and the teacher isn't objecting, then maybe they're not wrong. But if their behavior is making others uncomfortable, even if unintentionally, there's a social aspect. However, in a class where others are disengaged, the author's active participation might be a good thing. The problem could be that the other students are passive and not used to interaction, so they don't appreciate it. Alternatively, if the jokes are too frequent or out of place, that could be an issue.\n\nBut the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to engage and learn, which is a positive thing. Unless they're being asked to stop by the instructor or the questions are off-topic, they're probably in the right. The classmates' reactions might stem from their own lack of engagement or discomfort with active participation. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, maybe there's a balance between participation and overdoing it. If the questions are too numerous or the jokes are inappropriate, then maybe A. But the author mentions the questions are on-topic and for clarification. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
