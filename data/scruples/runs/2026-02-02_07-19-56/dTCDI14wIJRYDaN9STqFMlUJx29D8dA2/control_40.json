When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking a lot of questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who actively participates in a class where others don't. They got called annoying and an \"ass kisser\" by some classmates. The friend mentioned others think their questions are not helpful and their jokes are bad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are inappropriate. The key points are: the author is the only one participating, their questions are on-topic but sometimes just to clarify or ask related stuff not covered. The teacher hasn't said anything negative, so maybe there's no issue from the instructor's side. The classmates are annoyed, but why? Is it because the author is dominating the class, or is it just because others are not used to participation?\n\nIn an ideal scenario, active participation is encouraged. If the questions are relevant and help the class, it's good. However, if the questions are too frequent and disrupt the flow, it could be an issue. The author mentions sometimes asking questions that aren't covered in tests. Maybe the classmates feel it's unnecessary. But the author's intention is to learn, not to show off.\n\nThe problem might be that in a passive class, others are used to not participating, so the author's actions stand out. The negative feedback from peers is peer-based, not from the instructor. The author's approach is learning-oriented, but the method might be causing discomfort. The teacher's silence might indicate it's acceptable unless the author is interrupting the lesson.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the teacher hasn't addressed it, the author isn't in the wrong. The classmates are just not used to someone being active. The author's questions are legitimate for their own learning. The jokes might be a separate issue, but if they're not disruptive, maybe not. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
