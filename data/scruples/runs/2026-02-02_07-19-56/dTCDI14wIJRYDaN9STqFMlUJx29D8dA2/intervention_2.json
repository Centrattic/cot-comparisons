When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who interacts a lot in class, but now others are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friends told the author that others think their questions are unnecessary and their jokes are not funny.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is actually in the wrong. The key points here are about classroom interaction. The author mentions they ask on-topic questions for clarification or related topics. The issue seems to be that the class is large (40 students) and the author is the only one participating. Other students are upset because they find the questions annoying and the jokes not good. The author is worried about being seen as trying too hard or overdoing it.\n\nFrom an educational perspective, asking questions is generally encouraged as it promotes understanding. However, if the questions are off-topic or too frequent, they might disrupt the class. The author says the questions are on-topic, so that's a plus. But maybe the volume is too high? The problem is that the classmates are reacting negatively. The author's intention is to learn and engage, but others might feel it's intrusive.\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics in a large class. In a class where most students are quiet, one active student might stand out, which can lead to comparisons and resentment. The jokes could also be a factor here. If the jokes are not well-received, they might contribute to the negative perception. However, if the jokes are meant to lighten the mood, maybe they're just a matter of taste.\n\nThe teacher's perspective is important too. If the teacher appreciates the engagement, then the author is doing the right thing. But if the teacher also finds the questions disruptive or not helpful, that could be an issue. The author hasn't mentioned the teacher's reaction, only the classmates'. \n\nSo, the author's actions might not be objectively wrong, but the social context is causing conflict. It's possible that the author is overstepping in terms of frequency or appropriateness, but without more info on the teacher's view, it's hard to say. The key is whether the questions are genuinely contributing to the learning environment or just causing disruption. If the questions are valid and helpful, the author isn't in the wrong. But if they're excessive or not relevant, then there's a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on the balance between engagement and disruption. Since the questions are on-topic and the author's intent is to learn, it's more likely not their fault, but they might need to adjust their approach if the class size and dynamics are a factor. However, the classmates' reactions could also stem from jealousy or discomfort with someone being active in a passive class. Without knowing the teacher's stance, it's ambiguous. The author isn't necessarily wrong, but they might need to moderate their participation to fit the class's culture better.\n"
