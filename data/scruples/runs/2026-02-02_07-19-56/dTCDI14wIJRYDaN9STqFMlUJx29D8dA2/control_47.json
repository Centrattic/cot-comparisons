When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a junior computer science student who started a new class this semester. They like to ask questions in class, make jokes, and interact with the teacher. In the computer networks class, they're the only one doing this out of a class of 40. Their friends overheard classmates calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and even a specific person told them that others find their jokes \"moronic\" and that they're making a fool of themselves. The author is upset because they thought interacting in class was helpful for their learning and didn't realize others would be annoyed.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is asking questions that are on-topic but sometimes not covered in tests. They make jokes to lighten the mood. The problem is that in a class where most students don't participate, the author's active participation is drawing negative reactions. The classmates think the author is annoying, maybe because they're the only one participating, which could make others feel put on the spot or embarrassed. The teacher's perspective is also important. If the teacher isn't objecting, maybe the author isn't wrong, but if the teacher is annoyed, that's a problem.\n\nBut the author mentions that their questions are on-topic and for clarification. That's a good sign. However, maybe they're asking too many questions that distract from the lesson or take up time that others could use. The jokes might be inappropriate if they're not related to the material or if they're forced. The term \"ass kisser\" suggests that others think the author is trying too hard to please the teacher, which could be perceived as insincere.\n\nThe key factors here are whether the author's actions are disruptive, if the questions are relevant, and if the jokes are in bad taste. The author is in a passive-aggressive environment where others aren't participating, so their active participation might be causing discomfort. However, if the author is genuinely seeking to understand and contributing positively, maybe they're not wrong. But if the questions are unnecessary or the jokes are off-topic, that could be an issue.\n\nThe author's friend relayed that others find the jokes moronic and the questions unhelpful for tests. So maybe the author's approach isn't aligned with what the class needs. But the author's intention is to learn, so they might not be in the wrong. However, sometimes in large classes, excessive participation can be seen as disruptive if it's not managed well. The author might need to balance their participation with the class's needs and the teacher's preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If their questions are relevant and their jokes are light-hearted, they might not be wrong. But if the participation is causing disruption or making others uncomfortable, then there might be some fault. However, the teacher's reaction isn't mentioned, which is a crucial factor. Since the author is trying to engage in learning and the criticism comes from peers, it's possible they're not in the wrong, but they might need to adjust their approach. Given the information, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions are aimed at learning, but there's room for them to consider the class dynamics more.\n"
