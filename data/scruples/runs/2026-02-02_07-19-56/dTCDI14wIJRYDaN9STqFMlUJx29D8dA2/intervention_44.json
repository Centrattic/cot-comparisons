When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The author is a junior CS student who's been interacting a lot in a class where others don't. Now, some classmates are calling them annoying and making jokes about them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is engaging in class, which is generally seen as a positive thing. They mention asking on-topic questions for clarification and sometimes even questions related but not covered. They also make jokes to help their learning. But their classmates are reacting negatively, calling them annoying and making snide comments about being an \"ass kisser\" and \"moronic\" jokes. The friend even mentioned the teacher might not appreciate the questions that aren't test-related.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention is to learn and engage, but others perceive it as excessive or inconsiderate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, participating in class is usually encouraged. The author is trying to stay engaged, which can benefit their own learning and potentially help others by prompting the teacher to clarify. However, if their participation is overwhelming the class or making others uncomfortable, it might be problematic. The author mentions they are the only one speaking up, which could mean their questions might be redundant if others aren't following, but the author is seeking clarification.\n\nThe classmates' reactions are negative, but that doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong. People have different thresholds for participation. However, if the questions are off-topic or not relevant, that could be an issue. The author says the questions are on-topic but sometimes related but not covered. If those related questions are distracting or not useful, that might contribute to the negative perception.\n\nAlso, the jokes: if they are intended to be light-hearted but are seen as \"moronic,\" maybe they're not landing well. The key is whether the author's actions are respectful and not overstepping. The friend's account suggests that the teacher might not appreciate the questions not covered in tests, implying that the teacher might see them as irrelevant. That could be a point against the author if they are using class time for questions that don't pertain to the course objectives.\n\nBut the author's intent is to learn, which is valid. The problem might be the frequency or the way they're phrased. The author should consider if their participation is genuinely helping the class or if it's seen as seeking attention. Balancing participation with others' needs is important. Maybe the author should ask if their questions are necessary or if they can be addressed through office hours or other means. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are good, their approach might not be well-received, possibly because of the frequency or the nature of the questions/jokes. It's a balance between active participation and respecting others' learning environment. The answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong but needs to adjust their approach.\n"
