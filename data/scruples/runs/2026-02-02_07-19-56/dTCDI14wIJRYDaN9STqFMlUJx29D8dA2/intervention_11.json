When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a computer science student who interacts a lot in class by asking questions and making jokes. They're one of the few students doing that in a class of 40, which is probably a big lecture. They found out that some classmates think they're annoying and called them an \"ass kisser\" and their jokes \"moronic\". The friend they talked to said others think they're making a fool of themselves because the teacher might not appreciate off-topic questions and clarifications that aren't test-related.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The student is engaging in class, which is generally encouraged. Asking questions can help with understanding and shows interest. However, if the questions are off-topic or not relevant to the course material, that might be an issue. The problem is that the other students and the friend suggest that the questions aren't covered in tests and that the jokes are not well-received. Also, the teacher might not appreciate the constant interruptions.\n\nBut the user is a junior, so maybe they have some experience in previous classes. They thought their interaction was helpful. The issue might be about social dynamics in a large class. In a big lecture, some students might prefer a quieter environment, so being the only one asking questions could be disruptive or seen as seeking attention. However, the teacher's role is to facilitate learning, so they might appreciate the engagement. \n\nThe key points here are whether the questions are on-topic and if the jokes are inappropriate. The author mentions the questions are on-topic but sometimes related but not covered. If the questions sometimes go beyond the syllabus, maybe that's why others are annoyed. The jokes being called \"moronic\" could be a red flag. If the humor is not well-received, that could contribute to negative perceptions. \n\nBut the author isn't doing anything that's explicitly wrong. Engaging in class is generally a good thing. The problem is the social backlash. The answer might hinge on whether the questions are truly relevant. If they are on-topic and aimed at clarification, then the author is in the right. However, if they're too frequent or off-topic, that's different. The friend's friend says the teacher doesn't appreciate it, but the author has no feedback from the teacher directly. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They're trying to engage and learn, which is positive. The negative reactions from peers might stem from envy or discomfort with the attention the author gets. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but maybe there's a balance to find. Alternatively, if the questions are indeed irrelevant or the jokes are inappropriate, then maybe A. But the author hasn't been told directly by the teacher. Since the other students are passive, maybe the author is just the one contributing, which is a good thing. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
