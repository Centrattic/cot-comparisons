When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a junior computer science student who interacts a lot in class by asking questions and making jokes. However, other students have called them annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and the friend says they're making a fool of themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The author's intention is to engage and learn by asking questions, which is generally a positive trait. However, the key points here are the reactions of other students and the friend's comment. The author mentions that their questions are on-topic and sometimes for clarification, but others think they're not relevant to tests and that the jokes are moronic. \n\nNow, considering classroom dynamics, it's possible that the author is overdoing it. Even if the questions are on-topic, if they're interrupting the flow or if the teacher doesn't appreciate them, it could be problematic. Also, making jokes in class might be seen as unprofessional or distracting. The friend's information that others find the author annoying suggests that the author's behavior is affecting the class environment negatively.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider the author's perspective. They might be genuinely trying to participate and contribute, especially in a large class where engagement is low. Maybe the author is unaware of the social dynamics or the right way to interact in such a setting. The teacher's role here is also crucial; if the teacher encourages questions, then the author's actions might be appropriate. But if the teacher is against it, then the author might need to adjust.\n\nAnother angle is the social aspect. In a large class, some students might prefer a more passive learning environment. The author's active participation could be seen as taking up time or attention that others feel should be reserved for the teacher's lecture. The term \"ass kisser\" implies that others think the author is trying too hard to please the teacher, which could be perceived as insincere.\n\nI should also consider whether the author's questions are genuinely helpful or if they're redundant. If the questions are clarifying points that others might have, it's beneficial. But if they're just the author's personal curiosities not relevant to the course, that's different. The friend's comment about questions not being on the test suggests that the author's questions might not be aligned with the course objectives, which could frustrate peers who are focused on exams.\n\nIn terms of the jokes, if they're not appropriate or disruptive, that's another issue. Even if the author thinks the jokes are light-hearted, others might find them unprofessional, especially in a technical field like computer science where the focus is on content.\n\nThe author's emotional reaction\u2014feeling torn up\u2014shows that they care about their peers' opinions and want to fit in. This might indicate that they're sensitive to criticism and could benefit from adjusting their approach rather than being outright wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If their questions are genuinely helping them learn and are respectful, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the questions are disruptive or if the jokes are inappropriate, then they might need to adjust. The fact that others are annoyed suggests that the author's behavior is affecting others negatively, even if their intentions are good.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be in the wrong if their actions are indeed causing distraction or annoyance without significant educational benefit. However, if their participation is encouraged by the teacher and the questions are relevant, then others might be unreasonable in their criticism. The key is the balance between personal engagement and respecting the classroom environment.\n"
