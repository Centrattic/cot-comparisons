When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The author is a junior CS student who's been the only one participating in their computer networks class. They get feedback from peers that they're annoying and called names like \"ass kisser\" and their jokes are \"moronic.\" The friend mentioned others find the jokes stupid and that the teacher might not appreciate off-topic questions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author's actions are problematic. The key points here are participation vs. over-participation, the content of the questions (on-topic but sometimes related but not covered), and the social dynamics in a large class. \n\nThe author mentions they ask questions to clarify or for related topics not covered. If the questions are on-topic, they're valid. However, if they're too frequent or off-topic, that could be an issue. The peers' reactions suggest they feel the author is dominating the class, making others uncomfortable. But in a class of 40, maybe the author's participation is necessary for engagement. \n\nAlso, the teacher's role is important. If the teacher encourages questions, then the author is just following that. But if the teacher hasn't addressed the volume, the peers might be reacting negatively. The jokes being called \"moronic\" could be a red flag if they're distracting or in poor taste. \n\nThe author's intention is to learn and engage, which is positive. However, social interactions in class can be tricky. Even if the author is doing something right, the perception from others matters. The question is whether the author is overstepping by being the sole participant, leading to negative peer reactions.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's questions are reasonable and respectful. If they're on-topic and not disruptive, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the questions are excessive or the jokes are causing disruption, the author could be at fault. The teacher's perspective isn't provided, so it's hard to judge, but the peer reactions are significant. Since the author is trying to engage and learn, but peers are upset, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the questions are too many or the jokes are inappropriate, then yes. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to weigh the intentions against the impact. The peer feedback is important. Even if the author is well-intentioned, if it's causing others to feel annoyed, maybe they should adjust. But maybe in a passive class, participation is needed. It's a tough call. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author is participating and the questions are on-topic, but the negative reaction from peers is a concern. Alternatively, if the questions are too frequent or the jokes are off-putting, then A. But the problem says the questions are on-topic and sometimes related but not covered. The jokes are the issue. So maybe the author is not in the wrong for the questions but the jokes. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong overall. Since the author is the only one participating, maybe they're not in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
