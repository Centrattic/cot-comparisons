When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who interacts a lot in class, but in the new computer networks class, they're the only one doing so. Other students find them annoying, calling them an \"ass kisser\" and \"moronic.\" The author is upset because they thought their interaction was helpful for learning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is wrong. The key points are: the author is the only one asking questions, which are on-topic but sometimes not test-related. The friends say others think it's annoying. The author interacts to learn but now feels bad.\n\nOn one hand, asking questions is generally good for learning and engagement. The author's intention is positive. But maybe they're overdoing it, or their questions aren't appreciated by others. The other students might feel the author is getting attention they don't want, or the questions are disrupting the class flow. The author's jokes being called \"moronic\" could be part of the issue.\n\nBut the teacher hasn't said anything negative, right? The problem comes from peers, not the instructor. If the teacher encourages questions, then the author is doing the right thing. If the teacher is annoyed, that's a different story. However, the peers' reaction might stem from their own disengagement or discomfort with the author's participation.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if their actions are within the bounds of what's expected. However, if the questions are too frequent, off-topic, or if the jokes are inappropriate, that could be an issue. The fact that friends overheard others calling them names suggests peer tension. Maybe the author should reflect on the tone and frequency of their questions and adjust if necessary, but isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to engage and learn.\n\nSo the answer is B (Not in the wrong). They're taking initiative in a class where others aren't participating, which is positive. The peers' reaction is more about their own behavior or the class environment. Unless the teacher objects, the author isn't at fault. They might need to adjust slightly but aren't in the wrong.\n"
