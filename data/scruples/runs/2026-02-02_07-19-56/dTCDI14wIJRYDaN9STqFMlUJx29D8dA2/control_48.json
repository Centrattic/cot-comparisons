When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class. They interact a lot, make jokes, and the only one participating in a class of 40. Friends told them others are calling them annoying and a kiss-up. The person is upset because they thought they were being helpful and engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: they're the only one asking questions, which they think helps them learn. Their questions are on-topic but sometimes related but not covered. Others find them annoying, and the teacher might not appreciate the questions not on tests. \n\nIs it wrong to ask questions? Well, in a learning environment, asking questions is usually encouraged. It shows engagement and curiosity. However, if the questions are constant or off-topic, that could be an issue. But the user says their questions are on-topic or related. The problem seems to be that others are passive and don't interact, leading to the user being the sole participant. Maybe the others are not used to someone being so active, or they feel the user is showing off? \n\nThe user mentions making jokes. If the jokes are inappropriate or distracting, that's a problem. But they say the jokes are to help them learn, so maybe they're just trying to lighten the mood. However, others found the jokes moronic, so maybe they're not well-received.\n\nThe friends' reactions indicate that the user's behavior is perceived as annoying. But the user's intention is to learn and engage. Teachers generally appreciate students who ask questions. The fact that the user is the only one interacting might make others feel self-conscious or think the user is trying to impress the teacher. However, that doesn't necessarily make the user in the wrong. If the questions are legitimate, they should be asked. However, if the user is overdoing it, asking unnecessary questions, that could be an issue. The user says they ask for clarification sometimes, which is valid. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong if their questions are relevant and they're trying to learn. The problem might be the frequency or the way they're being asked. But without the teacher commenting directly, it's hard to say. The user should probably adjust their approach if they're dominating the class, but the intent is positive. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
