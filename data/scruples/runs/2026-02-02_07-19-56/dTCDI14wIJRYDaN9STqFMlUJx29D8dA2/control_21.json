When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking a lot of questions in class. The situation is that the author is a junior computer science student who actively participates in class, but their peers find it annoying and even use derogatory terms like \"ass kisser\" and call their jokes \"moronic.\" The friend who overheard others says they think the author is making a fool of themselves, especially since the teacher might not appreciate questions not covered on tests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a class of 40 where only they interact, which suggests they're trying to engage in a class that's otherwise passive. The questions are on topic and for clarification, so that's a positive. However, the peers are upset, which complicates things. The key points here are the intent of the author versus the impact on others.\n\nThe author's intent seems to be to learn better through interaction and clarification. That's a valid reason. But the impact is that others find it annoying. The question is whether the author is wrong despite good intentions. \n\nNow, in educational settings, participation is generally encouraged. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, it could disrupt the class. The author mentions that some questions are about things that might not be covered on tests, which could be seen as irrelevant. But the user clarifies that they are on-topic. Still, the peers' reaction is negative, possibly because they feel the author is overstepping or showing off.\n\nAnother angle is social dynamics. In a class where most students are passive, one active student might stand out. The peers might feel the author is getting special attention or that their questions are unnecessary. The friend's friend also suggests the teacher might not appreciate the extra questions. If the teacher hasn't addressed this, maybe the author is overcompensating.\n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong if they're following the teacher's guidance. If the teacher hasn't said anything, the author's actions are probably appropriate. However, if the questions are excessive or off-topic, even if on-topic, they could be a problem. The user mentions the questions are sometimes to clarify or ask related things, which is fine, but if they're too frequent, it might disrupt the flow.\n\nAlso, the jokes being called moronic could be an issue. If the humor isn't well-received, that's another point. The author might need to adjust the frequency or content of their jokes.\n\nIn summary, the answer depends on balancing active participation with respecting others' comfort. Since the author's actions are causing peers to feel annoyed and there's a possibility of over-participation, maybe the author should adjust their behavior. But if the teacher hasn't addressed it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, peer perception is part of the social aspect of school, and the author might need to adapt to maintain a positive environment without being discouraged from learning.\n"
