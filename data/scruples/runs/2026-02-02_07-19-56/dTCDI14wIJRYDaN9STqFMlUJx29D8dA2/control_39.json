When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class, leading to peers calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a junior CS student who's been active in class, asking questions and making jokes. In their new networks class with 40 students, they're the only one participating. Friends told them others are annoyed by this. The author is upset and seeking validation.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is engaging in class, which they see as helpful for their learning. The problem arises because classmates are annoyed. The author's actions are on-topic but maybe sometimes tangential. They're being called names and told they're making a fool of themselves.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a learning perspective, asking questions is generally encouraged. It shows engagement and curiosity. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, they might disrupt the class. The author mentions some questions are for clarification or related but not covered. The teacher's reaction isn't mentioned, so we don't know if the teacher agrees with the students' complaints.\n\nThe social aspect is tricky. In a class where others aren't participating, the author's active participation might stand out. Some might see it as positive, others as showboating. The jokes being called \"moronic\" suggest that maybe the humor isn't landing well. The term \"ass kisser\" implies that others think the author is trying too hard to please the teacher, which could be perceived as insincere.\n\nHowever, the author's intent is to learn, not to show off. They mention that interacting helps them learn. Unless the questions are genuinely disruptive or off-topic, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The classmates' reactions might stem from jealousy or discomfort with someone who's more engaged.\n\nAlso, in many educational settings, participation is valued. If the teacher doesn't object, the author is probably not wrong. The problem might be more about the peers' attitudes than the author's actions. But if the questions are too many and not relevant, maybe the author should adjust their approach.\n\nBut the author's goal is learning, and they're not being disruptive. The issue is the classmates' perception. Unless the teacher has addressed the issue, the author isn't in the wrong. They might need to gauge the right balance, but their actions aren't inherently wrong.\n"
