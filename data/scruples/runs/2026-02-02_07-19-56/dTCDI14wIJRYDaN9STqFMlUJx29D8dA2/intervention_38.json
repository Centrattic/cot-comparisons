When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a junior computer science student who asks a lot of questions in class and is being called annoying by peers. The author is conflicted because they thought their interaction was helpful for learning but now others are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. The student is the only one participating in a class of 40. Their questions are on-topic, sometimes for clarification or related but not covered. They make jokes to engage. The classmates find them annoying, calling them an \"ass kisser\" and their jokes \"moronic.\" The friend confirmed others think they're making a fool of themselves and the teacher might not appreciate the off-topic questions.\n\nThe key points here are the impact on others and the teacher's reaction. The author's intention is positive\u2014they want to learn and engage. However, the negative feedback from peers suggests their actions are disrupting the class. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nIn academic settings, active participation is generally encouraged, but it's important to balance it. If the student is dominating the class time to the point where others are annoyed, that's a problem. However, if the teacher hasn't addressed it, maybe the teacher appreciates it and the peers are just jealous or shy. But the student's jokes being called \"moronic\" might indicate they're not well-received. Also, asking questions that aren't test-related could be seen as not focusing on what's important for the course.\n\nBut the student's main motive is learning and engagement. They aren't necessarily being disruptive unless their questions are too frequent or off-topic. The peers' reaction is negative, but that doesn't automatically make the student wrong. It could be that the peers are uncomfortable with being in a quiet class and don't like the attention the student is getting.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the student's actions are genuinely disruptive. If the teacher hasn't said anything, maybe it's okay. But the peers' feedback is valid. However, in many cases, the student is in the right for participating actively. The problem might be more about the peers' intolerance rather than the student's behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
