When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for asking too many questions in class. The author is a junior computer science student who interacts a lot in class, which he finds helpful for his learning. However, his classmates are calling him annoying and making jokes about him. His friend overheard some students saying he's an \"ass kisser\" and that his jokes are \"moronic.\" The author is now torn because he thought his participation was positive but is being criticized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the only one interacting in a class of 40. The questions are on-topic but sometimes related to topics not covered in tests. The classmates don't like it because they find it annoying and possibly unnecessary. The teacher's perspective isn't mentioned, but the student claims the teacher might not appreciate the questions that aren't test-related.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, participating in class is generally encouraged for learning. However, if the questions are excessive or off-topic, it could disrupt the class. The key points here are that the questions are on-topic but sometimes not covered in tests. The classmates' reaction suggests they find it annoying. The author's intention is positive\u2014to learn and engage\u2014but the classmates perceive it as negative. \n\nBut wait, the problem might be the frequency. If he's the only one asking questions in a large class, maybe he's overdoing it. However, if the questions are valid and on-topic, it's a sign of engagement. The classmates' judgment might stem from insecurity or their own discomfort with being active in class. Also, the jokes being called \"moronic\" could be an issue if they're not well-received, but the author mentions they're meant to lighten the mood. \n\nThe teacher's reaction isn't specified, so maybe the teacher appreciates the engagement. If the teacher didn't say anything, perhaps the classmates' opinions are unfounded. On the other hand, if the questions are leading the teacher off-topic or wasting time, that could be a problem. But the author says the questions are for clarification or related topics. \n\nIn academic settings, asking questions is usually encouraged as it fosters a better understanding. Unless the questions are disruptive or irrelevant, they shouldn't be a problem. The classmates' negative reaction might be due to their own lack of participation and resentment towards someone who is engaged. The author isn't in the wrong if he's genuinely trying to learn and contributing positively. However, if his questions are excessive or not well-considered, it might be an issue. But given the information, the author's intent is good, and the classmates' criticism might be unwarranted. So the answer is B.\n"
