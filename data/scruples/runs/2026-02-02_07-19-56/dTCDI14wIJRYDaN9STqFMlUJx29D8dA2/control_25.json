When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior CS student who's been asking a lot of questions in class. They mentioned that they're one of the few who interacts, and now others are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friends overheard this, and it's making the user feel bad. They want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about classroom participation. The user is engaging by asking questions and making jokes, which they find helpful for learning. But the classmates don't appreciate it, thinking the questions are irrelevant and the jokes are bad. The user is confused because they thought interacting was good.\n\nI need to consider the context. In a class where others are silent, being proactive can be positive. But maybe the user is overdoing it. The key points are: are the questions on-topic? The user says they are, but some are just to clarify or relate to topics not covered. The jokes are part of their interaction. The classmates' reaction is negative, but maybe their intent is good.\n\nAnother angle: the teacher's perspective. If the teacher didn't address the user's behavior, maybe it's okay. But if the teacher also finds the questions unhelpful, that's a problem. The user's friend mentioned that the teacher might not appreciate questions not on the test. So maybe the user is focusing on areas that aren't relevant to the course's goals.\n\nAlso, the social aspect. Even if the user isn't wrong in an academic sense, peers' reactions can affect the environment. Jokes that are deemed \"moronic\" might be off-putting. But the user's intention is to engage and learn. They might not be aware of how their actions are perceived.\n\nSo, is the user at fault? If their questions are mostly on-topic and helpful for their learning, but the class environment is such that others are uncomfortable, maybe they should adjust. However, if the teacher supports the interaction, then the user isn't wrong. But since the classmates are reacting negatively and the friend's report says the teacher might not appreciate it, there's a chance the user is overstepping. But it's also possible the classmates are just jealous or not participating themselves. \n\nIn academic settings, asking questions is generally encouraged. The problem might be the frequency or type of questions. If they're asking too many or irrelevant ones, that's an issue. The user mentions some are for clarification, which is good. The jokes might be the issue if they're distracting. But the user's main intent is to learn. \n\nThe answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the user is trying to engage and learn, which is positive. However, they could consider the class dynamics and adjust if necessary. The classmates' reactions are negative, but that doesn't necessarily mean the user is wrong. It's a balance between participation and respecting others' learning preferences. So the user isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
