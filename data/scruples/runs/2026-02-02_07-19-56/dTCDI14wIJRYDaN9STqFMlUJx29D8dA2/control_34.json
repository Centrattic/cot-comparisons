When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class, asking questions and making jokes. They're the only one participating, which they thought was okay. But now, after some negative feedback from peers, they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether their actions are inappropriate. The key points here are: they're the only one participating in a class of 40, their questions are on-topic but sometimes not test-related, and others find them annoying or calling them names. \n\nAsking questions in class is generally a good thing. It shows engagement and can help others as well. But if they're the only one, others might perceive it as taking over the class. Jokes that are considered \"moronic\" might not land well with everyone. However, the friend's account mentions that the students are calling them names and the other person said the teacher might not appreciate the off-topic questions. \n\nBut the teacher hasn't said anything to the author directly, only the peers. The author's intention was to learn and interact, not to annoy. The problem might be the social dynamics rather than the author's actions. It's possible that in a large class, some students are uncomfortable with one person being active, even if it's positive. However, the author isn't doing anything against the rules. \n\nSo the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might need to adjust their approach, like asking if the teacher prefers certain times for questions or if their jokes are appropriate, but the act of participating is not wrong. The peers' reactions might be due to their own discomfort or envy. The answer should be B (No) because the author is not in the wrong; they're engaging in a positive way, and the issue is more about peer perception than the actions themselves."
