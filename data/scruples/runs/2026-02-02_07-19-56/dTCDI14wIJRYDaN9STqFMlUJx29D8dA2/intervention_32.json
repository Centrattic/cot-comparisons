When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a junior CS student who's been active in class, asking a lot of questions and making jokes, but now classmates are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard some students saying this, and one admitted it's because the author is the only one interacting, which others find bothersome.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions are genuinely problematic or if the classmates are just being unproductive. The author mentions that their questions are on-topic but sometimes related to things not covered. They thought interacting helped them learn. Now, others are annoyed because they're the only ones participating. \n\nIn class, teachers usually encourage questions if they're relevant. If the author is asking questions that help their understanding, that's a good thing. However, if the questions are too frequent and disrupting the class, or if the jokes are inappropriate or distracting, that could be an issue. The post doesn't say the author is being disrespectful or that their questions are off-topic. It sounds like they're genuinely trying to engage and learn.\n\nThe term \"ass kisser\" implies that the classmate thinks the author is trying to impress the teacher, but the author's stated intent is to learn and interact. The classmate might be jealous or not participate themselves, leading them to criticize the author. The teacher not appreciating the questions is a concern, but the author hasn't received any feedback from the teacher, only from peers. \n\nI should consider if the author is overstepping. If they're the only one asking questions, maybe the teacher isn't managing the class well, or the other students are too shy. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to engage unless their questions are intrusive. Since they're on-topic and for clarification, it's likely they're in the right. The classmates' judgment might stem from their own lack of participation, not the author's actual wrongdoing. So the answer is B.\n"
