When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The person is a junior computer science student who's been active in class, asking questions and making jokes to help with learning. Now, others in the class are calling them annoying and an \"ass kisser.\" The friend overheard this and the person is now feeling bad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the student is actually in the wrong. The key points are that their questions are on-topic, even if sometimes related but not covered. They're the only ones interacting in a class of 40, which might make others feel they're getting too much attention. The student thought their actions were okay, but others are upset.\n\nIs it their fault? Well, asking questions is generally encouraged in learning. But there might be a balance. If their questions are excessive and disruptive, that could be an issue. However, the scenario states they're trying to clarify and the questions are on-topic. Also, the teacher hasn't indicated any problem, which is a key factor. The students' reactions might stem from jealousy or not wanting to participate, but that doesn't mean the student is wrong. \n\nThe student's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive. The fact that others are not participating and then criticizing the one who does might be more about their own behavior than the student's. Unless the student is being disruptive, they're probably not in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because active participation is usually good unless it's clearly inappropriate.\n"
