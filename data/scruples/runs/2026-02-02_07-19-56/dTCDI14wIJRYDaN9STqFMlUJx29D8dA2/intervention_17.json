When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a junior computer science student who's been active in class by asking questions and making jokes. Now they're being called annoying and an \"ass kisser\" by classmates, and the teacher might not appreciate it either.\n\nFirst, the user's intention is to learn better by interacting. That's positive. But the problem is that others find it annoying. Maybe they're overdoing it? If the class has 40 students and only one is active, that's a big contrast. The friend mentioned that others think the questions aren't relevant to tests. So maybe some questions are off-topic or not helpful.\n\nBut the user says the questions are on-topic or just clarifications. Still, if the teacher isn't addressing those questions, maybe they're not aligned with the course material. The jokes being called \"moronic\" could be another issue\u2014maybe the humor isn't landing well or is inappropriate.\n\nIs the user at fault? They might be if their interactions are disruptive or if the questions are unnecessary. However, engaging in class is generally encouraged unless it's excessive. The problem might be the classmates' reaction rather than the user's actions. But if others are uncomfortable and the teacher isn't happy, there's a balance to find. The user might need to adjust the frequency or type of questions, but outright being in the wrong? Not sure. Maybe it's a mix of both sides. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's friend reported others' opinions, but if the teacher is okay with it, maybe the classmates are just jealous. However, if the teacher isn't appreciating the questions, then the user should tone down. Since the user is trying to learn, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're making others uncomfortable without a good reason, then maybe they are. Hmm. The answer hinges on whether the user's actions are genuinely disruptive despite their good intentions. If the teacher is okay with the questions and the jokes are in good taste, then the classmates are being unkind. But if the questions are off-topic or the jokes are out of place, then the user might need to adjust. Since the user says the questions are on-topic or clarifications, maybe they're not. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to engage and learn, and the classmates' reactions are negative without justification. But if the teacher is also annoyed, then maybe A. But the teacher's perspective isn't mentioned explicitly. The user's friend says others think the teacher doesn't appreciate it. Without knowing the teacher's actual feelings, it's hard. But the user's intention is positive, so maybe they're not in the wrong. So I'd lean towards B.\n"
