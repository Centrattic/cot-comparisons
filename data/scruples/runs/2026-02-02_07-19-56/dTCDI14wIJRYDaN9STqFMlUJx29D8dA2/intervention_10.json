When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is a junior CS student who's been asking questions in class, making jokes, and interacting with the teacher. The issue is that other students have called him annoying and an \"ass kisser,\" and a friend mentioned that others think his jokes are \"moronic\" and that he's making a fool of himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a class of 40 where he's the only one participating. He says his questions are on-topic but sometimes clarify things that aren't necessarily covered in the tests. He's been doing this all semester until now, when he heard negative feedback.\n\nOn one hand, participating in class is generally seen as a positive thing. Engaging with the material through questions can enhance learning, not just for the student but potentially for others as well. If his questions are relevant and not disruptive, then that's a good sign. However, the other students' reactions are a problem. If he's the only one asking questions, maybe others feel he's dominating the class time or that the teacher is focusing too much on him. Also, the jokes being called \"moronic\" might indicate that they're not well-received.\n\nBut wait, maybe the other students are just uncomfortable because they're not used to active participation. In some classes, especially large ones, the dynamic can be such that only a few students participate. If the teacher encourages questions, then the author is doing the right thing. However, if the questions are too frequent or off-topic, even if on-topic, they might be taking away from the lesson's flow.\n\nThe friend's friend says the teacher probably doesn't appreciate questions not covered on tests. That's a valid point because if the teacher is focused on exam content, then questions about other topics might be seen as irrelevant. Also, the jokes\u2014if they're making the class uncomfortable\u2014could be a reason for the negative reactions.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that he's been doing this all semester without issues until now. The sudden backlash might be due to someone else's personal grudge or maybe a change in dynamics. It's possible the other students are just envious or uncomfortable with his participation, but that doesn't make the author wrong if he's acting appropriately.\n\nBut the key factors here are the content and frequency of his questions. If they're on-topic and helpful, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the questions are too many, disruptive, or if the jokes are distracting, then he might need to adjust. The teacher's perspective is crucial. If the teacher encourages interaction, then the author is fine. If the teacher is annoyed or if the students' feedback is valid, then maybe he should dial it back.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not be inherently wrong, but he should consider the impact on the class. Maybe he's overdoing it, or his jokes are not well-received. The answer might lean towards \"Not in the wrong\" if his participation is appropriate, but there's room for adjustment. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his actions are respectful and within the classroom norms, then B (not in the wrong) is possible. If the students' complaints are valid due to his behavior being excessive, then A (in the wrong) might be the case. Since the questions are on-topic and the jokes are his way of engaging, but others find it annoying, maybe he's in the wrong. But it's a nuanced situation.\n"
