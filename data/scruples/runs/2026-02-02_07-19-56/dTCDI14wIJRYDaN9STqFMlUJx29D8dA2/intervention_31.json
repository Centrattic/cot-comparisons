When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a junior CS student who's been active in class, asking questions and making jokes, but now others are calling him annoying and a \"kisser.\" The friend says the others find his questions annoying and his jokes moronic, and that he's making a fool of himself.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to engage and learn, which is positive. They mentioned that asking questions helps them understand better. However, the problem here is that the class size is 40, and only they're interacting. That's a lot of attention. Even if the questions are on-topic, maybe they're too frequent or not well-timed. The other students might perceive them as disrupting the class or taking up time that others could use.\n\nThe jokes part is tricky. If the jokes are relevant and help lighten the mood, maybe they're fine. But if they're seen as unnecessary or inappropriate, that could be why others find them \"moronic.\" The term \"ass kisser\" suggests that others think he's trying too hard to please the teacher, which might not sit well with peers who prefer a more silent or reserved approach.\n\nThe teacher's reaction isn't mentioned. If the teacher appreciates the engagement, then it's justified. But if the teacher isn't bothered, maybe the students are just envious or uncomfortable with someone who's too vocal. Peer perception can be harsh, especially in large classes where many students don't participate.\n\nThe author is questioning their approach because the feedback from friends is negative. It's possible that the author's interaction style is not considered appropriate by others, even if it's not inherently wrong. The key here is whether the questions are genuinely helpful or if they're excessive. If they're asking for clarification that others might also need but aren't speaking up, maybe it's a good thing. But if it's just to show off or get attention, that's different.\n\nThe friend who directly confronted him says the teacher doesn't appreciate questions not on the test. If that's true, then the author is focusing on irrelevant details. However, the author mentions the questions are either on-topic or related but not covered. If the teacher is okay with that, then it's a peer issue. But if the teacher is actually annoyed, then the author might need to adjust.\n\nIn academic settings, participation is often encouraged. However, balance is key. If the author is overshadowing others' participation or making the class time longer with unnecessary questions, that's a problem. But in a class where no one else participates, maybe the author is filling a necessary role. However, the negative peer reaction suggests that their approach might not be well-received.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to engage and learn. However, they might need to adjust their approach\u2014maybe ask questions more selectively, ensure jokes are appropriate, and check if the teacher is receptive. The problem isn't entirely on the author, but there's room for self-reflection and adjustment. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the teacher's perspective isn't provided, it's possible the author isn't at fault but needs to adapt. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
