They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe setup is that there are mugs in the breakroom, and they're used on a first-come, first-served basis. The author didn't see any rules about mug usage, and the mugs are washed and put back. The author grabbed a mug from the drying rack when the breakroom duty person hadn't put them away yet. The mug had the coworker's kids' pictures and the \"World's Greatest Dad\" slogan. The coworker came to ask for it back, and the author initially refused, then eventually returned it but the coworker was upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's defense is that there's no explicit rule about mug ownership. The mugs are considered communal, with a first-come system. However, the coworker claims that the mugs on the schedule are known not to be taken, and that this particular mug is kept in his office and only left in the breakroom during cleaning. The author didn't know that, but the coworker argues that the presence of his family photos should have indicated it's his personal mug.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author should have recognized that the mug was personal. The author didn't know it was his, but the coworker says that the photos and caption were clear. The author might argue that since the mug was in the communal area and there were no explicit rules, it was available. However, the coworker might have a point that when a mug has personal photos, others should be more cautious. The author didn't check the mug's ownership before using it, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might have been negligent in not keeping the mug in a more private place if it's personal. The fact that others on the chore schedule knew not to take it implies that there's an unspoken understanding, but the author wasn't on the schedule and might not have been aware. But the author's responsibility is to follow the general practice, even if they aren't on the chore list.\n\nThe author's actions were to take a mug that was in the drying rack, which is part of the communal cleaning process. The coworker might have left it out expecting it to be cleaned and returned, but the author took it before that. The author's use of it could be seen as taking someone else's personal item without permission.\n\nEven though there's no written rule, the presence of personal photos on a mug in a shared space is a strong indicator that it's someone's personal property. The author didn't ask, didn't check, and used it. The coworker's request for it back was reasonable, and the author's refusal to hand it over immediately could be seen as being in the wrong.\n\nSo, while the author might think the mugs are communal, the reality is that some items in communal spaces can still be personal. The author's mistake was not recognizing that and using it without permission. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
