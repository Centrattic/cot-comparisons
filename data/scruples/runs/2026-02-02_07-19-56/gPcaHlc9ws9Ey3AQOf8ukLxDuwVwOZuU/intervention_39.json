They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a coworker's mug without realizing it was theirs. The breakroom has a bunch of mugs that are used on a first-come basis, and there's no clear rule against using them. The author grabbed a mug from the drying rack when the breakroom person hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug had pictures of the coworker's kids, which the coworker later pointed out. \n\nThe key points here are: the previous system was first-come, first-served, and the mugs are washed and put back each day. The author didn't know the mug was the coworker's specifically. The coworker claims that others on the chore schedule avoid his mug, but the author wasn't on the schedule. So, the author's actions were in line with the usual practice, just taking a mug that was available.\n\nBut when the coworker asked for it back, the author initially refused, then gave it back but maybe with some attitude. The coworker felt it was his personal mug, which others know not to take. The author might have been in the wrong by not considering that the mug could be personal, especially since it had photos of him. Even if there's no rule, maybe the common courtesy would be to ask if it's needed. The coworker might have a point in feeling it's his personal item. However, the author had no prior knowledge and followed the existing practice. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the coworker clearly stated it's his and others avoid it, the author's ignorance might not excuse them. So, maybe the author is in the wrong slightly.\n"
