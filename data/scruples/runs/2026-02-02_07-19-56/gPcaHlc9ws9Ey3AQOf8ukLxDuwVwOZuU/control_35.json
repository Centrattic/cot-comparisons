They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using a coworker's mug by accident. The breakroom has a collection of mugs that everyone uses, right? The author grabbed a mug from the drying rack because the person in charge hadn't put them back yet. The mug had the coworker's kids on it, so it was clearly personal.\n\nThe author's defense is that there were no rules about mug usage, and they've always used them on a first-come basis. They didn't know it was his mug initially. The coworker, however, argued that everyone on the cleanup schedule knows not to touch his mug because he keeps it in his office otherwise. The author wasn't on the schedule, so they didn't know that rule.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether there was an unspoken rule about not using that specific mug. The author followed the general practice of using whatever mug was available, but in this case, the coworker had an exception. However, since the author wasn't part of the chore schedule, maybe they weren't aware of that exception. \n\nThe coworker might expect that when a mug is in the drying rack, even if it's personal, it's fair game since others handle the cleaning. But the coworker's argument is that the cleaning staff knows to leave it, so the author shouldn't have taken it. \n\nBut since the author didn't know that, and there was no explicit rule, it's a bit of a gray area. The author made a mistake by not realizing it was personal, but maybe the coworker should have kept it in a place where it wouldn't be mixed in. The author did return the mug and didn't cause any damage. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the usual practice and there was no explicit rule. The coworker's reaction might be over the top. So answer B.\n"
