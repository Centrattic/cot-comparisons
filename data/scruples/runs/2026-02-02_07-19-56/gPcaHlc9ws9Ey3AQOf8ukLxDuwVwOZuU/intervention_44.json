They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a coworker's mug without knowing it was his. The mugs are in a shared breakroom and there's no clear rule about who can use them. The author grabbed a mug from the drying rack, not knowing it was his coworker's. The coworker had a personal mug that had his photos on it, which the author didn't recognize.\n\nSo, first, the breakroom mugs are on a first-come basis. The author didn't know it was his coworker's mug. The coworker later confronts him, and the author gives back the mug but maybe with some resistance. The coworker's argument is that since the mug has his photos and the caption, it's his personal mug. The author didn't know that and used it in good faith.\n\nThe key points here are intent and knowledge. The author didn't have the intention to take the coworker's personal mug. They didn't know it was his. The coworker, on the other hand, might have expected others to know that the mug with his photos was his, but maybe he should have labeled it or kept it in a place where it's clearly personal.\n\nThe author did return the mug after being asked, even if there was some initial reluctance. The coworker's reaction seems a bit harsh, especially since there's no clear rule against using shared mugs. The author followed the common practice of taking whatever mug is available. The coworker's responsibility might be to keep his personal items in a secure place if he doesn't want others to use them.\n\nSo, considering that the author had no malicious intent and the coworker might have been using the breakroom mug despite its personal photos, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The responsibility could be on the coworker to better secure his personal items if he wants to prevent such situations. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
