They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using a coworker's mug without knowing it was his. The mugs are in a breakroom, and there's no official rules about using them. The author grabbed a mug from the drying rack because the person in charge hadn't put them back yet. The coworker later showed up asking for his \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug, which had his kids' pictures, and he expected the author to know it was his. The author didn't know initially and had to be given it back.\n\nFirst, there's the question of shared resources. The breakroom mugs are communal, right? People contribute mugs, and they're used on a first-come basis. The author didn't know the mug was his. The coworker said others know to leave his mug out, but maybe that's an unspoken rule that wasn't communicated clearly. The author had no reason to know it was his personal mug unless he had told people explicitly. If he kept it in his office otherwise and only left it out for cleaning, maybe he didn't make it obvious enough. \n\nAlso, the author washed the mug and returned it, so there's no harm done beyond the initial use. The coworker seems to be more upset about the principle, maybe feeling disrespected. But in an office where mugs are shared, is it reasonable to expect everyone to know which mugs belong to whom? If the coworker didn't label his mug or make it known that it's personal, then others can't be blamed for using it. The author followed the usual process: took a mug from the drying rack, which is part of the shared setup. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker did have a personal mug with his family's photos. Maybe he should have kept it in his office instead of leaving it in the drying rack if he didn't want others to use it. The fact that others avoid shelving his mug might be a known thing, but the author wasn't part of the chore schedule and might not be aware of that. \n\nSo the main points are: no official rules, the mugs are communal, and the coworker didn't make it clear that the mug was personal. The author acted within the shared system, and the coworker's expectation that others should know not to use it might be unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
