They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for using a coworker's mug. The details are that the breakroom has a bunch of mugs with no set rules. They're used on a first-come basis, and everyone helps clean them. The author took a mug from the drying rack, not knowing it was the coworker's. The coworker then came to get it, and the author initially refused, made up an excuse about a call, and later gave it back.\n\nSo, first, the key points here are the lack of explicit rules about the mugs, the author's unawareness that it was the coworker's until confronted, and the coworker's claim that others on the schedule know it's his personal mug. The author didn't have any intention to take it, just grabbed one from the drying rack. The coworker's reaction is a glare, implying the author is an asshole.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The mugs are supposed to be communal, but the coworker might have a personal mug that's supposed to stay in their office. The problem is that the author didn't have a rule to avoid his mugs, so they didn't know. But the coworker says that others on the schedule don't take his mug. The author, not being on the schedule, might not be aware of that practice. \n\nHowever, the coworker's mug was in the drying rack, which is part of the communal process. If he's supposed to keep it in his office, maybe he's the one who didn't follow the unspoken rule by leaving it in the breakroom. But when the author took it, they didn't know it was his. The coworker then asked for it back, and the author didn't immediately comply but gave it back after a bit of a confrontation. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not being aware of the unspoken rule, but they also had a right to use the mugs as they were available. The coworker's frustration could be because others know not to take his mug, but the author didn't. The author could have been more considerate by checking if the mug was someone's personal one, but since there were no rules, maybe that's not fair. The fact that the coworker left it in the drying rack might be his own fault. \n\nAlternatively, even if it's a personal mug, if it's in the communal area, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for using it. But maybe the coworker expects that if it's his personal mug, others should recognize it and not use it. The author could be in the wrong for not recognizing the clues (the caption and photos) that it's someone's personal mug. However, the author might not be familiar with the coworker's family, so the photos might not be immediately recognizable. \n\nThe coworker then provides an alternative, which is a bit odd. The author's refusal to switch mugs might be seen as stubborn, but the coworker's approach was also abrupt. The author did eventually return the mug after washing it, so there's no lasting harm. The main issue is whether using the mug was a mistake. \n\nIn communal settings, sometimes people have personal items that are in shared spaces. If the coworker's mug was in the drying rack, it's part of the shared mugs. The author's action isn't malicious, but the coworker's claim that others know not to take it might be more about the behavior of others, not the author. Since the author wasn't on the cleaning schedule, they might not be part of the unspoken agreement. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The coworker might have misjudged the author's intentions and overreacted. The author could have been more cautious, but given the lack of rules, it's a bit of a gray area. The coworker's own placement of the mug in the communal area might be the issue. So the answer would be B.\n"
