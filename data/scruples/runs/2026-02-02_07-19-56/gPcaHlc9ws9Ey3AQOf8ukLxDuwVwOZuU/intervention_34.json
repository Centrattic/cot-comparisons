They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone using a coworker's mug without realizing it was personal.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the breakroom mugs are on a first-come, first-served basis and that there are no official rules. The coworker in question later claims the mug is his personal one, with his kids' pictures. The key here is whether the author had a reason to know it was his mug. The author didn't know the coworker had a specific mug kept in the breakroom only for cleaning, and others on the chore schedule were supposed to avoid reshelving it. However, the author wasn't on the schedule and grabbed it from the drying rack when it was supposed to be there. \n\nThe coworker's argument is that the mug's photos and caption indicated it was his, and that others on the chore schedule knew not to put it back. But the author wasn't on that schedule, so maybe they weren't aware of this unspoken rule. The author did return the mug after a brief period and didn't cause any damage. \n\nHowever, the author might have been negligent in not checking if the mug was someone's personal item. Since the mug had the coworker's image, it's reasonable to think it's personal. But the author didn't know at first and only realized later. The coworker's reaction seems harsh, but maybe the author should have been more cautious. \n\nOn the other hand, if the mugs are communal and the coworker didn't clearly mark it as personal, the author might not be at fault. But since the mug had specific photos, it's a bit of a gray area. The main issue is whether the author should have known. If the coworker's name or clear indication was there, then maybe. But the author didn't know and returned it. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because, even though the mugs were communal, the mug had personal photos, and the author should have been more careful. The coworker's claim is valid, and the author should have checked or asked when the coworker approached them.\n"
