They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a coworker's mug. The author took a mug from the drying rack in the breakroom, which turned out to be their coworker's \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug. The coworker then asked for it back, and the author initially refused but eventually gave it back after some back and forth. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the setup. The breakroom has a collection of mugs with no clear rules about usage. The author mentions that mugs are taken on a first-come, first-served basis, and they're all washed and put back. The author isn't on the chore schedule, so maybe they felt they could take any available mug. The coworker in question has a mug with his kids' pictures, which the author didn't recognize until later.\n\nNow, the key points here are about ownership and expectations. The author took the mug from the drying rack assuming it was available. However, the coworker claims that the mug isn't usually put in the cupboard and is kept in his office. The breakroom cleanup people know not to put it with the others, but the author didn't know that. So the author had no prior knowledge that this specific mug wasn't supposed to be shared. \n\nThe coworker's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author didn't take the mug to keep it but used it temporarily. When asked for it, the author was willing to return it after finishing their coffee but was then asked to switch mugs. The author's refusal to comply with the switch might have been a point of contention. However, the main issue is whether taking the mug in the first place was wrong.\n\nSince the breakroom mugs are generally available for use by anyone, and there were no explicit rules against using them, the author might not be in the wrong. The coworker might have implicitly kept the mug in the breakroom for use, expecting others not to take it, but the author wasn't aware of this unspoken rule. The author's mistake was taking a mug that had personal photos, which might make it more identifiable as someone's personal item. However, without prior knowledge, the author acted based on the usual practice.\n\nSo, considering that the author followed the established practice (first-come basis) and there were no explicit rules against using any mugs, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong. However, the coworker's perspective is that the mug wasn't meant to be shared. But the author had no way of knowing that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe the coworker is being unreasonable. So the answer would be B.\n"
