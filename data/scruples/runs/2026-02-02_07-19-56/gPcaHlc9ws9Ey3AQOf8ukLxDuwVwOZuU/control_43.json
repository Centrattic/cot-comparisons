They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the breakroom has a collection of mugs with no explicit rules about their use. They're washed daily and put back. The mugs are used on a first-come, first-served basis, and sometimes people replace broken or missing ones. The author isn't on the chore schedule, so they might not be as familiar with the unspoken rules.\n\nThe incident happened when the breakroom duty person hadn't reshelved the mugs yet. The author took one from the drying rack, which turned out to be the coworker's \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug. The coworker found out and asked for it back. The author initially refused, then later gave it back after washing, but the coworker was upset.\n\nNow, considering the setup: the mugs are in a shared area, and there's no clear rule that the coworker's mug is personal. If the coworker had kept it in their office, maybe the situation is different. But if the mug was in the communal breakroom, perhaps the author isn't at fault. However, the coworker argued that others on the schedule knew not to take his mug, implying that it was understood as his. The author didn't know this unspoken rule, so maybe they weren't in the wrong. But if there's an established norm that certain mugs are off-limits, the author might have been careless not to notice the photos and caption. However, there's no explicit rule mentioned, so it's a bit of a gray area. The key points are whether the mugs are communal and if the coworker's ownership was clearly communicated. Since there's no rule against using them and the coworker's ownership wasn't obvious to others, the author might not be wrong. But the coworker's perspective is valid too. Hmm.\n"
