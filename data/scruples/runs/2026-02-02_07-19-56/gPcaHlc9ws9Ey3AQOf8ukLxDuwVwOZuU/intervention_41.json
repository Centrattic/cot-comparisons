They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author took a mug from the breakroom that turned out to belong to a coworker. The mugs are usually used on a first-come basis, but the coworker claims this one is his specifically. \n\nFirst, the breakroom mugs are shared, and there's no rule against using them. The author didn't know it was his coworker's personal mug. But the coworker mentioned that others on the chore schedule know to leave his mug out. However, the author wasn't on the schedule, so maybe he wasn't aware of that unspoken rule. \n\nThe coworker was upset and had to take a new mug to get his back. The author refused at first but later returned it. The coworker's reaction seems harsh. \n\nIn terms of office etiquette, the author probably should have checked if someone claimed the mug, especially since it had personal photos. But since the system was first-come, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The coworker didn't mark the mug clearly, relying on others to know. So maybe both parties share some responsibility. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since there were no explicit rules, the author followed the norm. However, the coworker had a claim based on the photos. The author might have been negligent in not recognizing the photos as personal. So maybe the author is partly at fault, but not entirely. The coworker's reaction was also over the top. \n\nHmm. The answer might be A, but I'm not sure. The key points are about unspoken rules and whether the author should have known. If the coworker kept the mug in his office and only left it out for washing, the author might not have known. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
