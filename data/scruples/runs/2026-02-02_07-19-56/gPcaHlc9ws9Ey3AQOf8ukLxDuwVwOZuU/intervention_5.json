They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. The situation is that there are shared mugs in the breakroom, and they took one that wasn't put away yet. The coworker had a specific mug with his kids' pictures, so it's clearly his. The author didn't realize it was his at first, but after being told, they kept it longer than necessary, which caused a conflict.\n\nFrom the breakroom policy, it seems like the mugs are shared on a first-come basis. But the coworker had a specific mug that others on the chore schedule knew not to put away with the others. The author, not being on the chore schedule, might not have known this. However, once the coworker confronted them, the author could have just given it back immediately. Instead, they made an excuse about a call and delayed, then delivered the mug but maybe not in a timely or respectful way.\n\nThe coworker's reaction is understandable because the mug is personal and important. The author's mistake was using someone else's personal item without permission. Even if the mugs are usually shared, the presence of the photos and the caption should have indicated it's a personal mug. So, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that and for the delay in returning it. But maybe the coworker overreacted a bit too. But given the situation, the author probably should have known better once shown the photos.\n"
