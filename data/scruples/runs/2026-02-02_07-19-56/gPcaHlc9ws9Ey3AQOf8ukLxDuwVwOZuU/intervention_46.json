They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is about using a coworker's mug without knowing it was theirs. The breakroom has a bunch of mugs, and usually, they're used on a first-come basis. The author took a mug from the drying rack when the person assigned to breakroom duty hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug had the coworker's kids on it, so it was personal.\n\nThe author says there were no rules about mug usage, and people just take them as needed. But the coworker argues that since the mug has his photos and caption, others on the chore schedule know it's his and avoid using it. The author didn't know that, so they took it. The coworker had to confront them and ask for the mug back. The author then washed it and returned it but the coworker was upset.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about shared resources vs. personal items. The author assumed the mugs were communal, but the coworker considered this specific mug as personal. The author didn't know it was his, so maybe they didn't intend to take it. But the coworker had a reason to believe it was his and that others respected that. The author's action, while maybe not malicious, was a mistake in this context. \n\nBut wait, the breakroom mugs are supposed to be shared, right? The author might not be in the wrong because there's no explicit rule saying not to use certain mugs. However, the coworker's perspective is that the mug is personal, so using it was a breach. The author didn't check if it was someone else's, but maybe they should have. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIf the coworker kept the mug in his office except when it was being cleaned, then maybe the author shouldn't have taken it when it was out. The coworkers on the schedule know to leave it, but the author wasn't on the schedule. So perhaps the author's mistake was not being aware of an unspoken rule. But if there's no clear rule, is the author really at fault? \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't know it was the coworker's. On the other, the coworker's mug was left in a place where others might take it. The author's action was innocent but the result was taking someone's personal item without permission. The coworker's reaction might be a bit over the top, but the author did use it without knowing it was personal. So maybe the author is a little in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, since the mugs are communal, the author isn't wrong. But the presence of personal photos makes it a personal item. The author should have checked if the mug had someone's name or photos. Maybe the author is in the wrong because they used a personal item from a shared space without realizing it's someone else's. The answer could be A.\n"
