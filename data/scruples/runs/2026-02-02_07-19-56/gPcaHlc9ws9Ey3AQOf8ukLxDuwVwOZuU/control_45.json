They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves using a coworker's mug without knowing it was personal. \n\nFirst, the breakroom has a collection of mugs with no official rules. The author grabbed one from the drying rack because the mugs weren't reshelved yet. They didn't know the mug was the coworker's because the coworker isn't on the cleaning schedule and keeps it in his office, but it got washed by someone else.\n\nThe key points are about shared resources and expectations of privacy. The coworker expected his mug to be kept separate, but the system relies on people knowing which mugs are personal. The author didn't know, but the coworker might have not made the mug distinct enough. However, the coworker did mention that others on the schedule avoid his mug, implying it's his responsibility to keep it out of the shared rotation. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the usual first-come-first-serve basis. They returned the mug after being confronted, even though they initially didn't know. The coworker's reaction seems harsh because the author didn't intentionally take it. But the coworker might feel that the mug should have been identifiable as personal. \n\nIt's a gray area. The author might be in the right because there were no clear rules, but the coworker could argue the mug was personal. However, since the coworker didn't keep it out of the shared area properly, maybe the author isn't at fault. So the answer is B (No).\n"
