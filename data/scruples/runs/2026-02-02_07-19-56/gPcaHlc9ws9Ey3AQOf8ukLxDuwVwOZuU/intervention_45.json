They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. \n\nFirst, the context: The office has a shared breakroom with mugs that are used on a first-come basis. They get washed and put back. The author took a mug that wasn't theirs, and later found out it was their coworker's personal mug. The coworker got upset and asked for it back, and there was some tension.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. Were there any established rules about mug usage? The author mentions there are no specific rules, just a first-come basis. 2. Did the author have reason to know it was the coworker's personal mug? The coworker claims that others know not to take it because they've kept it in their office, but the author didn't know that. 3. The coworker's reaction: He was upset and insisted on getting it back, which the author eventually did.\n\nNow, considering the lack of explicit rules, the author might not have known the mug was personal. However, the coworker had kept it in their office, which might imply it's not meant to be shared. The author took it from the drying rack, which others use. The coworker's argument is that others on the chore schedule avoid taking it, so maybe there's an unspoken understanding. \n\nBut the author wasn't on the chore schedule and might not be aware of this unspoken rule. The coworker's response could be seen as overreacting, but the author did take something that had personal photos and was meant as a personal item. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have been careless in not checking if the mug was someone else's, especially after seeing the photos. However, the coworker didn't clearly mark the mug as personal, and the system was first come, first served. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? There's a gray area here. If there's an unspoken rule that people know not to take certain mugs, then the author might have violated that. But if the rules are truly just first come and not to take mugs kept in offices, then the author might not be at fault. The coworker's behavior (glaring, being confrontational) also suggests he's in the wrong, but that's separate from whether the author was.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have known the mug was personal. Since the coworker kept it in his office and only left it out for washing, the author might not have been aware. But the presence of personal photos could be a clue. Still, the office system didn't have clear rules. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's some responsibility. But the coworker's reaction is also questionable. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because there were no explicit rules, and the coworker didn't clearly mark the mug. The author had a right to use any available mug, and the coworker should have ensured it was stored properly to avoid confusion. However, the coworker's argument that others know not to take it might suggest an unspoken rule, which complicates things. But without clear communication, the author isn't necessarily at fault. So final answer B.\n"
