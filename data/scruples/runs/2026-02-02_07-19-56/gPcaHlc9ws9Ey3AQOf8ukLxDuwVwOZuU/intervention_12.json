They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong for drinking from their coworker's \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The breakroom has a collection of mugs with no formal rules. They're used on a first-come, first-served basis. The author took a mug from the drying rack because the person responsible for reshelfing hadn't done it yet. The coworker later claimed the mug specifically, as it had his kids' pictures and he keeps it in his office otherwise. The author gave it back but the coworker was upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider the norms and expectations. The mugs are communal, with no stated rules. The author didn't know it was personal, as the mug was left in the drying rack. The coworker might have implied it's a personal item by keeping it in his office, but there's no sign or indication that others were aware. The author used it without knowing, and returned it after being asked. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be in the wrong because the mug was personal to the coworker. On the other, the setup of the mugs suggests they're shared, and the author had no prior knowledge. The coworker's expectation might be that if it's in the drying rack, it's fair game. The author's action was innocent but it's a personal item. \n\nBut the coworker could have put a note or kept it out of the shared area. The author did return it and didn't cause damage. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, as it was a misunderstanding. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the mugs are shared and there were no clear rules against using them."
