They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they took a mug from the breakroom that turned out to be their coworker's. The coworker had a specific mug with his kids on it, so it's pretty personal. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that there are rules about mugs being first-come, first-served, and that they're washed and put back. But the coworker says that he keeps his mug in his office and only leaves it out for the cleanup person to wash. The other people on the schedule know not to take it. \n\nSo the key points here are: Was there an unspoken rule or expectation that this particular mug was off-limits? The author didn't know it was his until asked. But the coworker argues that the photos and caption should have indicated it's his. The author didn't check before using it, and when confronted, didn't immediately give it back without a bit of a standoff.\n\nEven though the mugs are generally shared, this one was personal and the coworker had a reason to believe it wasn't for general use. The author might have assumed it was fair game since it was in the drying rack. But the coworker's perspective is that he had a right to it because of the personal photos. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The author didn't intentionally take a personal item, but they also didn't consider that some mugs might be personal. The coworker's reaction is understandable because the mug is a personal item with family photos. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have been inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering that the coworker had a reasonable expectation of privacy and ownership over the mug, the author might have been in the wrong for using it without realizing it was personal. However, there's no explicit rule against taking mugs, so it's not entirely clear. But since the coworker had a valid reason to believe it was his and the author should have been more cautious, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
