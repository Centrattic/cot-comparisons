They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong for using a coworker's mug. The story is that there are mugs in the breakroom, all mixed up, and people use them first-come, first-served. The author took a \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug from the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hadn't shelved them yet. The coworker found out and exchanged mugs, but the author refused and later gave it back, leading to a glare.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the office setup: mugs are communal, no explicit rules. Everyone uses them as needed, cleaned daily. The author isn't on the chore schedule, so they might be more used to taking mugs as they need. The coworker's mug had his kids' photos, which is personal. The coworker claims he keeps it in his office but left it out for the cleaner to wash. The author didn't know it was his until confronted.\n\nNow, was it wrong to take it? The key points are intent and awareness. The author didn't know it was the coworker's, so there's no intent to take it. The coworker's mug was in the shared drying rack, which the author assumed was available. But the coworker might have considered it personal and expected it to be kept separate. The issue is whether the author should have known or if the responsibility lies with the coworker to keep their personal items out of the communal area.\n\nIn many workplaces, people might keep their personal items in their workspace, but when placed in a shared area like a drying rack, they're often considered communal. The coworker's own schedule might have included not putting his mug in the shared rotation, but the author followed the usual practice. The author might not be at fault since the mug was in a shared space. However, the presence of personal photos could be a red flag, but the author might not have noticed until after the fact. The coworker's reaction is harsh, but the author didn't intentionally take it. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
