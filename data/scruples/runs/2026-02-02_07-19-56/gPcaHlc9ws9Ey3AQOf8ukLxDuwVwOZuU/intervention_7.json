They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using a coworker's mug without knowing it was theirs. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the breakroom has a bunch of mugs that everyone uses on a first-come basis. There's no stated rules, so the author assumed it's okay to use any mug they find. They took a \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug that was on the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hadn't put it away yet. The author didn't know it was the coworker's personal mug until the coworker came to get it. \n\nNow, the coworker claims he keeps that mug in his office and only leaves it out when it's being washed. Others on the chore schedule know not to touch it. The author took it before he could, which he didn't expect. The question is whether the author was wrong for using it.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Were there any explicit rules about mug usage? The post says there are none, just a general understanding of first-come. 2) Did the author know it was the coworker's mug? They didn't realize it was his until confronted. 3) Did the author have a right to use it under the existing system? Since there's no rule against using any mug, but there might be an unspoken understanding that personal mugs aren't shared. \n\nBut the problem is the coworker's assumption that others know not to take his mug, even though there's no explicit rule. The author followed the existing practice they observed. The coworker's anger might stem from the lack of prior knowledge about the mug's ownership. The author acted in good faith, thinking it was a communal mug. However, the coworker's perspective is that the mug is personal and should be left alone. \n\nIn most office settings, unless something is marked as personal or kept in someone's space, others might use it if it's in a shared area. The fact that the coworker had the mug in the breakroom for washing might imply it's part of the shared space. The author didn't intentionally take it knowing it was his. So the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a cultural assumption here about personal items in shared spaces. \n\nBut the coworker did say that others on the schedule know not to take it. If there's an unspoken rule that people know to avoid his mug, then the author might have violated that. However, since the author wasn't on the schedule and didn't know, perhaps they can't be blamed. \n\nIt's a bit ambiguous. The author used the mug without knowing it was personal, and the coworker's expectations might not be clearly communicated. The answer hinges on whether the author's action violated an unspoken rule. If the coworker's setup wasn't clear, the author might not be at fault. But if others knew, maybe the author should have too. However, the author had no reason to know unless it was obvious. The photos on the mug could hint it's personal, but the caption is common for mugs, so maybe not. \n\nIn the end, the author likely isn't at fault because they followed the observed practice and only realized it was personal after being told. The coworker's issue is more about lack of clear communication. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
