They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: There's a breakroom with a collection of mugs, no official rules. People take them as they need, with a rotating chore to wash them. The author grabbed a mug from the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hadn't put them away yet. The mug had the coworker's kids' pictures and \"World's Greatest Dad.\" The coworker showed up, asked for the mug, and the author initially refused but later gave it back after a bit of a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was there an unspoken rule about the mugs? The author mentions that mugs are on a first-come basis, and there are no rules stated. The coworker claims that the mug is his personal one, kept in the breakroom for cleaning, and that others know not to take it. The author didn't know this, and the coworker didn't mark it as personal property. \n\nNow, in a shared space like a breakroom, even without explicit rules, there's often an understanding. The coworker kept the mug in the breakroom for cleaning, which might imply it's communal. But he also says that others on the chore schedule know not to shelve it with the rest. That part is a bit confusing. If others avoid it, maybe the author should have known. But the author didn't know about that unspoken rule. \n\nThe author's defense is that there's no stated rule against using the mugs. The coworker's argument is based on the photos and the caption indicating ownership. The author used the mug without realizing it was personal. The coworker then had to confront them, which could be seen as a misunderstanding. \n\nFrom a social norms perspective, in an office, it's generally considered courteous to avoid taking others' personal items, even if they're left out. But if the mug was in a communal area without clear personal markings (except the photos), the author might not have known. However, the presence of the coworker's kids in the pictures is a clue. The author should have realized it might be personal upon closer inspection after the coworker pointed it out. \n\nThe author's actions: They took the mug without knowing it was personal, then when confronted, tried to hold onto it, made up an excuse about a call, and only gave it back after washing. The coworker felt disrespected. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the coworker's claim of ownership was clear enough. The mug was in a shared space, so maybe the author didn't know it was personal. However, once they saw the photos, they should have realized it's personal and returned it immediately. The author's initial refusal and the excuse might have exacerbated the situation. \n\nSo, the author is partially in the wrong for not recognizing the mug's personal nature and for the way they handled the confrontation. The coworker might have been more clear about the mug's status. But since the author took it without knowing, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, in an office setting, respecting others' personal items is important. The answer could swing either way based on perspective. But given the coworker's actions and the photos, the author might be in the wrong for continuing to hold onto the mug after being informed.\n"
