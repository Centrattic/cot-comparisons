They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. The situation is a bit of a gray area.\n\nFirst, the office has a collection of mugs in the breakroom, and there are no official rules about using them. The author mentions that mugs are used on a first-come basis. So, there's a general understanding that anyone can take a mug. The coworker in question had a mug with his kids' pictures and the caption \"World's Greatest Dad.\" The author took it from the drying rack when the breakroom person hadn't reshelved them yet. They didn't realize it was his until he came to ask for it. \n\nThe coworker claims that others on the chore schedule know not to take his mug, implying that he keeps it in his office and only leaves it out for washing. The author, however, wasn't on the chore schedule and wasn't aware of this unspoken rule. \n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. There's no official policy about mug usage, so the default is first-come.\n2. The coworker didn't make it clear that the mug was off-limits, even though he might have expected others to know. \n3. The author had no intention of keeping the mug and returned it after washing.\n\nThe coworker might feel violated because the mug has personal photos and is personal property. On the other hand, the author followed the usual practice without knowing it was private. The resolution was handled by the author returning the mug, but the coworker's reaction seems harsh. \n\nIn such cases, it's often about communication. Since there were no explicit rules, the coworker should have marked the mug as personal. The author might not be in the wrong because they followed the existing norms. However, if the coworker had previously kept the mug in his office and only left it for cleaning, the author might have been expected to notice. But since it was left in the drying rack, the author's action was within the shared understanding. \n\nTherefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's close. The coworker's responsibility is to secure his personal items if he doesn't want others to use them in a shared space. The author acted within the office's implicit rules, so the answer is B.\n"
