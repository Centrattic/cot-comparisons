They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the breakroom has a collection of mugs, no explicit rules about usage. Everyone uses them first-come, first-served. The mugs are washed by a rotating schedule, and the author isn't on that schedule. The author took a mug from the drying rack because the assigned person hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug had \"World's Greatest Dad\" with pictures of his kids, and the coworker later claimed it. The author had no idea it was his until confronted. Then the coworker asked for it back, author refused at first, then gave it back after some conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here. The mugs are in a shared space, with a first-come system. The author doesn't know about the specific mug being personal until told. The coworker claims others on the chore schedule know to not take his mug, but the author wasn't part of that schedule. But the author did use it, which the coworker found out and was upset.\n\nNow, the author's argument is that there were no rules, and they followed the existing practice of first-come. The coworker, on the other hand, had a personal mug that he expected others to recognize and leave alone. But if the practice was that people don't know which mugs are personal, and the author couldn't have known, then maybe the author isn't at fault. However, the mug had his pictures and a caption that might be a hint, so maybe the author should have realized it's personal. Also, when confronted, the author didn't immediately return it but gave excuses and then washed it later. That could be seen as being inconsiderate, even if unintentional.\n\nBut the coworker's side is that he keeps the mug in his office except when it's being washed by the schedule. The fact that the author took it before the scheduled person reshelved it might not be the author's fault, since they had no way of knowing. However, the presence of personal photos might imply that it's a personal item. So, maybe the author should have been more observant. Also, the author's behavior after being confronted\u2014making excuses, not immediately returning it\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut in an office where mugs are shared unless specified otherwise, the author might not be in the wrong for using a mug that was available. The problem is the coworker's expectation that others know not to use his mug. If the coworker didn't make it clear that this mug is personal, then maybe he's also at fault for not keeping it in a place where it's not shared. The author followed the existing practice and had no prior reason to think it wasn't a shared mug. However, the presence of personal images could be a clue. So, there's a bit of a gray area here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using a mug with someone's personal photos might be considered using a personal item, even if it's in a shared space. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not recognizing that it's a personal item. But the coworker didn't explicitly mark it as personal, so the author might not have known. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might depend on whether the mug's design clearly indicates it's personal. If the author could reasonably not know, then they're not in the wrong. If it's obvious, then they are. But the author did notice \"weird\" pictures but didn't connect it to the coworker immediately until he came to get it. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the coworker is being sensitive. Alternatively, the author should have been more careful. Hmm.\n"
