They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the office has a collection of mugs in the breakroom, and there's no official rules about using them. The author mentions that mugs are used on a first-come basis, and they're washed and put back daily by the assigned person. The author, as a senior staff, isn't on the chore schedule. So, when the mugs were still drying, the author took one labeled \"World's Greatest Dad,\" not realizing it belonged to a coworker. Later, when the coworker came to retrieve it, there was a conflict.\n\nThe coworker argued that the mug is his because of the photos and caption, and that people on the chore schedule avoid putting it back with others. The author thought the mugs were communal, so using one wasn't wrong. But the coworker clearly had a personal attachment to that specific mug.\n\nSo, the key points are: the mugs are supposed to be shared, but the coworker had a personal mug that others knew to respect. The author used it without knowing it was personal. Was there an unspoken rule not to use certain mugs? The coworker said others on the schedule avoid his mug. If the author wasn't on that schedule, maybe they weren't aware of that rule. But the author had donated mugs before, so maybe they should have known that some mugs might be personal.\n\nBut the author didn't know it was the coworker's until confronted. The coworker's argument is that the mug is his and others avoid using it. The author's defense is that there's no official rule. However, in an office setting, even without written rules, people often have unspoken social norms. Using someone else's personal item, even if it's in a shared space, can be considered rude if others know to avoid it.\n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong because they used a mug that others were aware was personal, even if they weren't explicitly told. The coworker had a reasonable expectation of privacy or personal use for that mug. The author's action, while not malicious, was a breach of that unspoken agreement. Therefore, answer A (author is in the wrong).\n"
