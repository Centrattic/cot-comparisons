They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using a coworker's mug that has personal pictures on it. The mugs are in the breakroom, and there's no official rule about who can use them. The author took a mug from the drying rack when the breakroom duty person hadn't reshelved them yet. The coworker showed up and asked for the mug back, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, the key points to consider are the office culture and established norms. The author mentions that mugs are used on a first-come, first-served basis, and everyone washes them at the end of the day. The chore is rotated, but the author isn't on the schedule. The coworker in question keeps his mug in his office but left it out for someone to wash the previous day. The breakroom duty person usually reshelves the mugs, but the author took it before that happened.\n\nThe mug in question had the coworker's kids in the pictures, which might indicate it's personal. However, the author didn't know it was his until the coworker confronted them. The coworker claims that people on the chore schedule know not to shelve his mug, but the author wasn't on that schedule. So, the author might not be aware of that specific rule. \n\nThe main issue here is whether using the mug was a breach of office etiquette. Since there were no explicit rules against it and the mugs are generally shared, the author's action might not be wrong. However, the mug was personal, which complicates things. But since it was left in the general area for washing, maybe the coworker implicitly allowed others to use it. The author didn't know it was his, so there's no intent to take it. \n\nThe coworker's reaction seems harsh. The author did return the mug, so even if there was confusion, the conflict was resolved. But the coworker's insistence on getting it back immediately and the glare after the fact might suggest he's overreacting. The author's initial action was innocent, and there's no rule against using any mug. However, the presence of personal photos could imply it's not meant for general use. \n\nIn the absence of clear guidelines, the office culture seems to be first-come, first-served. The author followed that norm. The coworker's expectation that others should know not to use it might be unreasonable if he didn't communicate it effectively. The breakroom duty person might have known, but the author wasn't part of that group. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe the coworker should have made it clearer that the mug is off-limits. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
