They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using a coworker's mug without knowing it was theirs. The author is in an office where there's a collection of mugs in the breakroom. They mention that the mugs are used on a first-come, first-served basis, and everyone seems to take them as needed. The author grabbed a mug from the drying rack because the person assigned to breakroom duty hadn't put them away yet. The mug turned out to belong to a coworker, who showed up and asked for it back. The author initially refused but eventually gave it back after some back and forth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the office's usual practices. The author states there are no official rules about mug usage, and it's been a first-come system. The mugs are washed and reshelved by a rotating schedule. However, the coworker in question apparently keeps his \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug in his office and only leaves it in the breakroom when it needs to be washed. Others on the chore schedule know not to put it back with the rest. The author, who isn't on the chore schedule, didn't know this and took the mug from the drying rack.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and knowledge. The coworker expected that others would know not to take his mug because of the photos and the caption, and because he keeps it in his office otherwise. However, the author had no prior knowledge of this. The breakroom setup is such that mugs are communal and used as needed, with no clear indication that a particular mug is personal property. The author's action was based on the assumption that all mugs in the drying rack were available for use, which has been the case before.\n\nBut then, the coworker's assertion is that the mug is his personal property, and others on the schedule know this. The author, not being on the schedule, wasn't part of that unspoken agreement. So, the question is whether the author should have known not to take that specific mug. The mug has the coworker's image on it, which might be a clue, but the author didn't recognize him until the coworker confronted them. However, the presence of photos on a mug doesn't necessarily indicate ownership; mugs with family photos are common and might be shared.\n\nThe conflict arises from conflicting assumptions: the author assumed the mugs were communal, while the coworker assumed his mug was personal and others knew to leave it alone. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, led to a conflict because the coworker had different expectations. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a grey area. The author didn't have explicit rules against using the mugs, and the coworker didn't make the mug's personal status clearly obvious. However, the coworker did contribute to an unspoken norm by keeping the mug in his office and only leaving it when it needed washing, which others in the schedule respected. The author, not being part of that unspoken group, might not have been aware. Still, the presence of the coworker's image on the mug could be seen as a hint, even if the author didn't recognize him. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether using a mug with someone's image on it, without prior knowledge, is considered an overstep. Since the office has no written rules and the author followed the established practice until this incident, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the coworker's perspective is also valid because the mug is personal. The situation is more about differing expectations rather than a clear right or wrong. But since the author didn't know the mug was personal and the coworker didn't make it clear, the fault might be shared. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author acted based on the office's usual practices and didn't intentionally take a personal item, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the coworker's claim is that others knew not to take it, so the author might have been expected to know as well. This is a bit tricky. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because there's no explicit rule and they followed the existing practice. The coworker should have made the mug's personal status more obvious or communicated it better.\n"
