They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The office has a collection of mugs in the breakroom with no clear rules. People use them first-come, first-served. The mugs get washed and put back. The author grabbed the \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug from the drying rack when the breakroom duties hadn't been done yet. The coworker later showed up asking for it, and the author had to give it back after some back and forth.\n\nNow, the key points. The author didn't know the mug belonged to someone specifically. The coworker didn't have it in the usual spot; it was in the drying rack because the assigned person hadn't put it away. The author used it in good faith, thinking it was available. The coworker's argument is that since the mug has his photos and others know it's his, the author should have known. But the problem is, the mugs are communal, and there's no rule against using them. The coworker didn't mark the mug in a way that's obvious unless you know it's his. The author didn't have a way to know it was personal. Also, the coworker's approach seems a bit over the top\u2014taking a new mug and demanding the old one back without prior notice. \n\nThe author did apologize and returned the mug, but the coworker was upset. The main question is about whether the author was wrong. In an office with shared resources and no specific ownership rules, using a mug that's out in the open without clear indicators of personal ownership might not be the author's fault. The coworker, on the other hand, should have stored his personal items properly, especially if he's not on the cleaning schedule. \n\nSo maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. The coworker set up an expectation that others should know the mug is his, but there's no prior indication. The system relies on first-come basis, and the author followed that. The coworker's reaction seems harsh. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
