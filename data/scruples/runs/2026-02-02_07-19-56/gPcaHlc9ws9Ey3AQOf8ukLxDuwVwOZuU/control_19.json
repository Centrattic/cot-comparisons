They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who took the mug is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's a breakroom with mugs that are available for use. The author says there's no rule about mug usage, and they're used on a first-come, first-served basis. Everyone washes them, and they get put back. The author isn't on the chore schedule, but they still washed the mug later.\n\nThe key point here is the mug in question. The coworker had a \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug with his kids' pictures. The author took it from the drying rack when the breakroom duty person hadn't put them back yet. The coworker claims that only people on the chore schedule know not to take his mug, and that he keeps it in his office otherwise. The author didn't know it was his mug until confronted.\n\nSo, was there a rule that the coworker kept his mug separate from others? The author claims there were no rules about mug usage, so they assumed it was communal. The coworker's argument is that since the mug has his photos and the caption, it's his personal mug. But the author didn't know that. The breakroom mugs are usually communal, and the author had even donated some from conferences.\n\nThe coworker's behavior seems a bit possessive. If he wanted to keep his mug private, maybe he should have stored it elsewhere, not in the communal washing area. The author's actions were in line with the usual practice, but the coworker felt wronged. The author didn't intentionally take his mug; they just grabbed the first one available. The coworker's reaction seems over the top. The author did return the mug after being asked, which shows they were willing to comply. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, maybe the coworker should have kept his mug in his office as he said, not in the shared washing area. The author followed the existing norms, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is probably B.\n"
