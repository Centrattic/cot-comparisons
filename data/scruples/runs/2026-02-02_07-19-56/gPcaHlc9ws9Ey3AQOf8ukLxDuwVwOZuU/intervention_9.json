They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drinking from their coworker's \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: There's a breakroom with a collection of mugs. The author used a mug that turned out to be their coworker's. The coworker was upset and wanted it back. The author didn't know it was his initially and tried to return it after, but the coworker was still mad.\n\nSo, the key points here. The breakroom mugs are on a first-come, first-serve basis with no set rules. They get washed daily by rotation, and the author isn't part of the schedule. The coworker mentioned that others on the schedule know not to shelve his mug, implying he keeps it in his office usually. But this time, he left it in the breakroom for someone to wash, and the author took it.\n\nNow, the author didn't know it was his at first. They thought it was just another mug. Once they found out, they returned it. The coworker was upset because maybe he considers the mug personal, even though he left it out. But if the mugs are communal, then maybe the author didn't do anything wrong. But the coworkers on the schedule know not to take his mug, so there's an unspoken rule here. The author, not being on the schedule, might not be aware of that. So, was there a lack of knowledge about the unspoken rule?\n\nBut wait, the coworker said the others know not to take it. So maybe the author should have been aware, even if there's no explicit rule. The problem is that the author didn't know. The coworker might have expected that if you're part of the office, you know which mugs are personal. However, the author had no reason to know. The coworker's photos are on the mug, but the author didn't recognize him until later. So maybe the author isn't at fault here because they didn't know and tried to return it when they realized.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might have been negligent in leaving his personal mug in a place where others might use it. If he usually keeps it in his office and only leaves it out for someone to wash, maybe he should have ensured it's stored properly. The author took the mug when it was in the breakroom, which is a shared space. So, the author might not be wrong if the mugs are communal. But the coworker's specific request for others to leave it might be an unspoken rule, which the author wasn't aware of. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not knowing the unspoken rules, but given that the coworker left it there, maybe the coworker is also at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because there were no explicit rules, and the author acted in good faith once they found out. The coworker's reaction might be over the top, especially since he left the mug in a shared area. However, the fact that others on the schedule know not to take it suggests there's an unspoken agreement. The author might not have known that, so it's a bit of a gray area. But since the mugs are communal and the author didn't have prior knowledge, B seems more accurate.\n"
