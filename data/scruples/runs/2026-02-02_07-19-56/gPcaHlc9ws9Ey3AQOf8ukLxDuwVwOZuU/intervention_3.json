They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about someone taking a coworker's mug without knowing it was personal. The key points here are the setup of the office mugs. The breakroom has a collection, and the user says there are no rules, so it's first-come, first-served. Mugs are washed and put back by the chore crew. The author took a mug from the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hadn't put them away yet.\n\nThe author took the mug, used it, and then the coworker came to get it back. The author didn't realize it was his until the coworker confronted them. The coworker explained that the mug is personal to him and that others on the chore schedule avoid using it. The author refused to give it up at first but eventually did after some back and forth.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From my understanding, the main issue is whether there was an unspoken rule that the \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug was off-limits. The user mentions that the coworker keeps the mug in his office and only leaves it out for washing. Others on the schedule know this, so maybe the author didn't know because they're not on the chore schedule. The author isn't part of the chore rotation, so maybe they weren't aware of the unspoken rule.\n\nBut the problem is that the mug was left in the drying rack, which the author took as available. Since the coworker had to explain that others know not to take it, but the author didn't, maybe the author had no way of knowing. However, the mug had his pictures on it, which might have been a clue. The author thought it was weird but didn't check if it was someone's personal mug. \n\nOn one hand, there's the expectation that in a shared space, everyone should be aware of personal items. On the other, the coworker might not have made it clear enough that it's personal. The author didn't intentionally take it; they just used what was available. The coworker's reaction seems harsh, but maybe the author should have been more cautious. However, without explicit rules or markings, it's hard to say the author was wrong. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
