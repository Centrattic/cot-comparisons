They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by using their coworker's mug. The situation is that the mugs in the breakroom are used on a first-come basis, and there are no clear rules about mug ownership. The author took the \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug from the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hadn't reshelved them yet. The coworker later showed up and asked for it back, and there was some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the established norms. The breakroom mugs are used as a shared resource, with no specific rules mentioned. The author mentions that mugs are washed by a rotating schedule and put back. So the general assumption is that any mug in the breakroom is available for use. The author didn't know it was the coworker's personal mug because it had his pictures on it. But the coworker claims that people on the schedule know not to reshelve his mug, implying that others are aware it's his. However, the author isn't on the chore schedule, so maybe they weren't supposed to know that.\n\nThe key points here are whether there's an unspoken rule about personal mugs. The coworker's argument is that since his mug is in the breakroom occasionally, others know not to use it. But the author, being a senior staff not on the schedule, might not be privy to that. Also, the mugs are all washed and put back, so the author had no reason to think it was personal. The coworker's reaction seems over the top because the system was working as a shared resource until now. The author did wash the mug and return it, but the conflict arose because the coworker felt his personal item was taken without permission. \n\nBut wait, if the mug was in the breakroom and part of the shared mugs, even if it's personal, maybe it's fair game. The coworker might have erred by not keeping it in his office as he mentioned. The author didn't know it was his, so intent matters here. There's no rule against using any mug, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The coworker's claim might be about unspoken ownership, but without clear rules, it's hard to say. The author's action was innocent, but the coworker's reaction is about personal property in a shared space. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
