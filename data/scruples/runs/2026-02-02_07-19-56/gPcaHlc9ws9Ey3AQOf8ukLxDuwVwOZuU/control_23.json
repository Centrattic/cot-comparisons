They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the main issue is that they used their coworker's \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug from the breakroom. The coworker was upset and made them give it back. \n\nFirst, the breakroom has a collection of mugs, and there's no explicit rule about who can use which mug. The author mentions that mugs are used on a first-come, first-served basis and that everyone washes them. They also note that sometimes mugs get broken or disappear, and people add new ones. So maybe the general assumption is that mugs in the breakroom are communal.\n\nBut the coworker in question had a personal mug with his photo on it. He claims that people on the chore schedule know not to wash his mug with the others, so he keeps it in the breakroom for others to clean. The author took it when the breakroom duty person hadn't reshelved them yet. \n\nThe key points here are whether the mug was meant to be shared or if it was a personal item. The presence of the coworker's image on the mug suggests it's personal. However, the mugs are kept in a communal space, and there's no written policy. The author didn't know it was his until asked. \n\nThe coworker argues that since the mug has his pictures and the caption, it's clearly his. The author might have assumed it was fair game since it was in the breakroom. But maybe the fact that it's a personal mug with his image makes it different. \n\nBut then, if the coworker left it in the breakroom for washing, does that imply it's okay for others to use it during the process? The coworker's argument is that others on the chore schedule know not to touch it, but the author wasn't on the schedule. \n\nThe author didn't do it maliciously; they grabbed the first mug available. The coworker's reaction seems harsh, but maybe the author should have been more careful, especially if the mug had personal photos. However, since there's no clear rule, maybe the coworker is overreacting. \n\nIn the end, the author did return the mug and even washed it. The coworker still glared, which might be his fault for not making it clear. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo there's a gray area. If the mug was left in the communal area for washing, it's possible the author isn't wrong. But if the mug was personal and the coworker didn't want anyone else using it, then the author might be at fault for not realizing it was personal. \n\nBut the main issue is the lack of clear rules. The author acted based on the usual practice, which is first-come. The coworker's expectation that others know not to use his mug unless he's present is a personal policy not communicated widely. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
