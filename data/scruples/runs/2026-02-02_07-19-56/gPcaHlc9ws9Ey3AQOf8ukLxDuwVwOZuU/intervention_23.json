They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for drinking from their coworker's \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The office has a collection of mugs in the breakroom, and there are no official rules about using them. Everyone uses them on a first-come, first-served basis. The mugs are washed daily and reshelved. The author, a senior staff member not on the cleaning schedule, takes a mug from the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hasn't put them back yet. The mug belongs to a coworker, as evidenced by the photos and the caption. The coworker confronts the author, and a conflict ensues.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the absence of rules, the common practice of first-come, first-served, and the fact that the coworker's mug was left in the drying rack. The author didn't know it was his coworker's mug at first. The coworker claims that others on the schedule know not to take his mug, implying some unspoken rule. But the author isn't on that schedule, so maybe they were unaware.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, in the office environment, if there are no explicit rules, people usually go by implicit norms. The coworker's mug was left in the drying rack, which might be considered part of the shared mugs. However, the presence of personal photos suggests it's a personal item, which might mean it's not meant to be shared. But the coworker also left it in the drying rack, which could imply it's part of the communal use until he retrieves it. \n\nThe author took the mug before the coworker could, which led to the conflict. The coworker's reaction is strong, but perhaps his fault is not making it clear that the mug was personal. But the author could argue that since the mugs are communal and there were no rules, taking one was acceptable. However, the coworker's explanation that others on the schedule avoid his mug suggests there was an expectation of privacy or ownership that wasn't communicated to the author. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. They didn't know the mug was personal, but they could be expected to respect that kind of personal item. However, if the coworker left it in the communal area, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. The coworker's reaction might be overly harsh, but the author could have been more considerate by checking if the mug was claimed before using it. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's ambiguity, the author might share some blame for not being aware that the mug was personal. But the coworker also didn't secure his mug properly. However, since the office had a first-come basis and the author wasn't on the cleaning schedule, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But since the mug had personal photos, it's possible the author should have known better. Hmm.\n"
