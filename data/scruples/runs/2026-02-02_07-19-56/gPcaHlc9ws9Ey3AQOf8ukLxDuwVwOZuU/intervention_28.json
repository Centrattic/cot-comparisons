They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. The situation is that the breakroom has various mugs, and they're used on a first-come basis. The author took a mug that turned out to be their coworker's, who had specific photos of his kids. The coworker was upset and made the author give it back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the office's norms. The author mentions that there are no explicit rules about mug usage and it's a first-come, first-served system. The mugs are washed and put back daily. The author isn't on the chore schedule, so they might not be aware of whose mug is whose. The coworker, however, claims that the people on the chore schedule know not to put his mug back in the cupboard. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Was there an unspoken rule about the mug being personal? 2) Did the author have a reasonable expectation that the mug was available? 3) How did the coworker react, and was that proportional?\n\nThe author didn't know it was his coworker's until confronted. The coworker's argument is that the mug has his photos, so it's personal. But the author didn't know that. However, the coworker might have implied that the mug isn't part of the communal collection. If others on the schedule know not to take it, maybe there's an unspoken rule that the author wasn't aware of. But since the author isn't on the schedule, they might not have that knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, the author used a mug that wasn't clearly marked as personal. The coworker's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author didn't know. But the coworker might have a point if he expected others to respect his mug's personal nature. The author's response of not having a call and then washing the mug and returning it was a good gesture, but the initial act of taking the mug without knowing its personal significance could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If there's a communal system, the author had a right to use any available mug. But if the coworker's mug was considered personal and kept out of the rotation, the author might not have known and thus isn't at fault. The coworker's reaction is harsh, but maybe the author should have been more cautious. But given the lack of clear rules, it's not entirely their fault. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't know the mug was personal and the system was first-come. However, maybe there's a slight consideration for the coworker's perspective. But overall, the answer leans towards B.\n"
