They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using a coworker's mug labeled \"World's Greatest Dad.\" The scenario is pretty detailed, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the office has a collection of mugs in the breakroom, no official rules mentioned. People take them on a first-come basis and rotate chores for cleaning. The author grabbed a mug from the drying rack because the person in charge hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug was clearly personalized with the coworker's kids' pictures, so it's likely he owns it. But the author didn't know that at first and only realized later when the coworker came to get it.\n\nNow, the coworker argues that since the mug was in the breakroom, people on the chore schedule avoid taking it, so it's effectively his. The author didn't know this and assumed it was up for grabs. The coworker then asked for the mug, and the author refused initially but eventually returned it after some conflict.\n\nSo, who's right? The key points are whether there were established norms about the mugs. If the coworker keeps it in his office but leaves it for the cleaning person to wash, maybe others should know not to take it. But the author was just following the first-come basis without prior knowledge. The coworker might feel it's personal, but if there's no explicit rule, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, once the coworker pointed out that it was his, continuing to hold onto it could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the author had to be convinced to return it and the coworker was upset suggests a breach of unspoken office etiquette. So maybe the author is at least partially wrong for not being more considerate of the possibility that it's someone's personal item. But since the system was first-come, perhaps the author isn't entirely wrong. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. But overall, I think the author did something that upset a coworker, so maybe A (in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
