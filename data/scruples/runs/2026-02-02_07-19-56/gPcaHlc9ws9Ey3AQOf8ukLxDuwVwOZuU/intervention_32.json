They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: There's a breakroom with a bunch of mugs. They're all washed and put back on a rotating schedule. The author took a mug from the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug had pictures of the coworker's kids and the \"World's Greatest Dad\" caption. The coworker later showed up asking for his mug, and the author initially refused but eventually gave it back. Now the coworker is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here. The mugs are communal. The author didn't know it was the coworker's private mug. The coworker had mentioned to others that they keep the mug in their office and that only the chore schedule people handle it. But the author wasn't on that schedule, so maybe they weren't aware of this arrangement. The coworker's issue seems to be that the author used his private mug without permission.\n\nIs there a rule about mug usage? The author says there are none, and mugs are on a first-come basis. That suggests the author didn't break any official rules. However, the coworker had an informal understanding with others to keep his mug separate. But since the author wasn't part of that chore schedule, they might not have been aware. The coworker didn't clearly mark the mug as his personal property, just the photos and caption. The author might not have known it was his. \n\nAlso, when the coworker confronted them, the author did eventually return the mug. The coworker's reaction seems harsh because the author didn't know. But is there fault on the author's part? If the coworker had kept the mug in his office instead of leaving it in the communal washing area, maybe the situation could have been avoided. The author's mistake was assuming the mug was fair game, but if there were no rules, maybe they're not at fault. The coworker might have been negligent in not keeping his mug secure. However, the coworker did mention that others on the schedule know not to touch it, implying it's a known thing. The author wasn't on that schedule, so maybe they weren't supposed to know. \n\nHmm. The author didn't intentionally take the mug, just grabbed the first one available. The coworker's issue is about privacy and ownership. The author might have been in the wrong by using someone else's personal item without knowing it was theirs. But again, if the coworker left it in a communal area without clear ownership, maybe the author isn't at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. Depending on how strict the office's unspoken rules are, the author could be blamed for not being aware that certain mugs are personal. But if there's no explicit rule, maybe not. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's action was a violation of unspoken norms. If the coworker had kept the mug in his office, it would be his own fault for leaving it out. But if the office community has an understanding that certain mugs are off-limits, the author might not know. However, the coworker had mentioned to others that they keep it in their office, so maybe the author should have been aware. But since they weren't part of the chore schedule, they might not have that information. \n\nIn the end, the author didn't intend to take the coworker's mug, and the coworker's reaction seems overblown. The author returned the mug, so there's no lasting damage. The main issue is the coworker's expectation that the mug was private when it was left in a communal area. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
