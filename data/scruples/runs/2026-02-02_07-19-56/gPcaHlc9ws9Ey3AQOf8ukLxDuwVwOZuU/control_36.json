They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using a coworker's mug. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The breakroom has mugs with various sayings, and there's no official rules about using them. They are generally on a first-come basis, and people contribute mugs when they break or disappear. The author took a \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug from the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hadn't put them back. The colleague later came to get it, and the author didn't return it immediately, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mugs are in a shared space, no official rules, but the colleague claims the mug is personal because of the photos of him and his kids. The author didn't know it was his until the coworker approached. The coworker says others on the chore schedule know not to touch his mug, but since it was in the drying rack, the author took it. \n\nThe author's defense is that the mugs are communal, and they followed the first-come basis. But the coworker argues that the mug is personal and should be treated as such. \n\nNow, considering the norms. If there's no explicit rule, but in practice, there's an unspoken understanding that certain mugs are personal. The fact that the coworker's mug was left in the drying rack by the breakroom duty person might imply that it's part of the communal setup. However, the coworker's claim that others know not to touch it could create an expectation that the mug is personal. The author didn't know, though. \n\nSo, the question is whether using a personal item from a shared space, even if it's in a communal area, is wrong. If the mug is clearly marked with personal photos and the name, others might be expected to recognize it as personal. But if the author had no prior knowledge and the mug was in a place where it was accessible, then maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nBut the coworker's argument is that he keeps it in his office and only leaves it in the breakroom during cleanup. If the mugs are supposed to be part of a communal rotation, but this one is an exception, then the author might have made an honest mistake. However, the coworker's frustration is valid if others are supposed to avoid taking it. \n\nThe author did return the mug eventually, but the initial use without knowing it was personal might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the coworker's response of demanding the mug and acting hostile could be overreacting. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions might be seen as not wrong because there were no explicit rules, and the author followed the first-come basis. But the coworker's expectation of privacy for the mug is also understandable. Since the author didn't know and returned it, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author should have been more observant. Hmm. \n\nI think the key here is the lack of explicit rules. The author followed the existing practice (first-come), and the coworker's claim that others know not to touch it might be an unspoken rule that the author wasn't aware of. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the coworker's reaction is perhaps harsh. So the answer is B.\n"
