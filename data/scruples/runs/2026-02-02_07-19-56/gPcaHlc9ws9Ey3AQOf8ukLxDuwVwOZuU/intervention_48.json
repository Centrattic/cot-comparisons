They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about using a coworker's mug that has personal photos on it. The author took the mug from the drying rack when the breakroom person hadn't reshelved them yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the office's norms. The author mentions that mugs are stored in the breakroom with no specific rules, and they're used on a first-come basis. There's a routine where mugs are washed and put back, and the author isn't on the chore schedule. The key point here is whether there's an established expectation that mugs with personal photos aren't to be taken by others.\n\nThe coworker argued that because the mug had his photos and the caption, it was his personal property. The author took it without knowing, but maybe there's an implicit understanding that such mugs aren't shared. The coworker also mentioned that others on the chore schedule avoid taking his mug, implying that others were aware of it being his. However, the author wasn't on the schedule, so maybe they weren't expected to know.\n\nThe author's defense is that there were no rules, and the system was first-come. But if the mug had personal photos, it's reasonable to assume that someone might have a claim to it. The author didn't check if it was someone else's before using it. Also, when the coworker asked for it, the author was defensive and didn't return it immediately. Even though they eventually did, the initial refusal and the lack of awareness about the mug's ownership could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut on the other hand, if there were no explicit rules, the author might have reasonably thought it was fair game. The coworker's expectation that others would know not to take his mug is perhaps unspoken and based on prior knowledge that others had respected it. The author might not have been aware of that unspoken rule. However, the presence of personal photos could signal to someone that it's a personal item, so there's a reasonable expectation that others wouldn't take it.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using someone's personal item without permission is generally frowned upon. The author's actions were based on the assumption that mugs are communal, but when an item clearly has personal elements, it's more respectful to ask first. The coworker's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is justified if the mug was his personal property. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the mug's personal nature and not returning it immediately when asked.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the coworker's behavior being a bit over the top. Bringing a birthday mug to exchange might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. However, the core issue is whether the author had the right to use the mug without knowing it was someone else's. Since the mug wasn't labeled as communal and had personal photos, the author should have been more cautious.\n\nSo, weighing the norms of the office and the personal nature of the mug, the author likely did something wrong by taking it without knowing it was the coworker's. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
