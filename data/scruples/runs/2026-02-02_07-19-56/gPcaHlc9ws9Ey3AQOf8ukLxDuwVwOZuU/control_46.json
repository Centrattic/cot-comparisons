They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who drank from the coworker's mug is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The office has a collection of mugs in the breakroom, no clear rules. People use them first-come, first-served. Mugs are washed and reshelved daily. The author took a mug from the drying rack when the breakroom duty person hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug had the coworker's kids' pictures and said \"World's Greatest Dad.\" The coworker found out, asked for it back, and the author refused initially but later returned it after some back and forth.\n\nThe coworker claims that everyone on the chore schedule knows not to take his mug because he keeps it in his office and only leaves it out for the cleanup. The author argues that there were no rules and that mugs are fair game unless specified.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, there's ambiguity here. The coworker might have considered the mug personal, even if it's in a common area. However, the office culture seems to have an informal first-come policy. The coworker's claim is that the others on the schedule know not to take it, but the author wasn't on that schedule. The key points are whether there are unspoken rules about mugs and if the coworker had made his mug personal enough that others should know not to use it.\n\nThe author didn't know it was his mug initially and only realized when confronted. The coworker might have kept it out for the cleanup, expecting others to leave it alone. But since there were no explicit rules, the author might not have been aware. However, the presence of family photos might imply it's a personal item. \n\nIn many workplaces, even if mugs are in a common area, if someone leaves a mug with personal items, others might assume it's not to be used. The fact that the coworker mentioned others on the schedule avoid taking it suggests a tacit agreement. The author, not being on the schedule, might not have known this unspoken rule. But the coworker's irritation is understandable because he expected that his mug, with personal images, wouldn't be used by others. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author should have known it was personal. Since there were no explicit rules, but the mug had personal photos, it's a gray area. However, given that the coworker's own coworkers on the schedule knew not to take it, and the author wasn't part of that, maybe the author didn't have that knowledge. But the fact that he kept it in his office and only left it out for cleaning suggests he expected others to leave it alone. The author's action, while not malicious, might be seen as inconsiderate given the personal images. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because there were no explicit rules. However, the coworker's perspective is valid. But the options are A for yes (author wrong) or B for no. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the lack of explicit rules and the informal setup, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But if the presence of personal photos made it clear it's not a communal mug, then A. Hmm. \n\nI think the key is that the coworker had a reasonable expectation that others would know not to use his personal mug. Even if there were no rules, the photos indicate it's personal. So the author might be in the wrong because they used a mug that clearly had someone's personal photos. Therefore, answer A.\n"
