They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether using a coworker's mug that wasn't properly put away is wrong.\n\nFirst, the office has mugs in the breakroom with no clear rules. They're used on a first-come basis. The author took a mug from the drying rack because the person responsible for breakroom duty hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug had the coworker's kids' photos and the caption \"World's Greatest Dad.\" The coworker later showed up, asked for the mug, and got a replacement.\n\nThe key points here are about shared resources and implicit ownership. Even though there are no written rules, the coworker had established that the mug was his by keeping it in his office and only putting it out for cleaning when needed. The author didn't know it was his initially, but once informed, they refused to give it up immediately and made the coworker wait until they were done, which led to tension.\n\nThe author's defense is that the system was first-come, first-served, and they didn't know it was personal. The coworker's side is that the mug was his by virtue of the photos and the way he used it. \n\nIn shared spaces, people often assume certain items are communal unless they're clearly personal. However, mugs with personal photos might be seen as belonging to the person. The author didn't do anything malicious, but they didn't respect the implicit ownership once made aware of it. The coworker had to go through the hassle of getting a replacement, which could have been avoided if the author had given it back right away. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't know at first, once they did, they should have immediately returned it. The fact that they continued to use it and made the coworker wait suggests they were inconsiderate. The coworker was justified in wanting it back. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for not respecting the coworker's ownership after being informed. But maybe not entirely wrong since the system was informal. Hmm, but the author's actions led to conflict. So, probably answer A.\n"
