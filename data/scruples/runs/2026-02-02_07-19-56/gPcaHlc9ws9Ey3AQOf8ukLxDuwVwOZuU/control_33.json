They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: there's a breakroom with a collection of mugs that have various sayings and sometimes images. The author mentions that there are no official rules about mug usage, and they've been used on a first-come, first-served basis as long as they've worked there. The mugs are washed and put back in the cupboard each day by people on a rotating chore schedule. The author isn't on that schedule. \n\nThe incident happened when the breakroom duty person hadn't reshelved the mugs yet. The author took one from the drying rack, which turned out to belong to a coworker. The coworker came to ask for the mug back, and the author agreed to return it after their coffee. Then the coworker brought a new mug for the author to use instead. The author refused, said they had to get on a call (which wasn't true), washed the mug, and returned it, but the coworker was upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the office culture around mugs and the coworker's expectations. Since there are no official rules, the default would be that mugs in the breakroom are communal. The coworker might have thought his mug was personal because of the images of his kids, but the author argues that since it was in the shared space and part of the rotation, it's fair game. \n\nHowever, the coworker's claim is that it's his personal mug, not to be placed in the cupboard. The author took it from the drying rack, which is part of the shared cleaning process. The coworker might have been confused because others on the chore schedule knew not to shelve his mug, implying it's a personal item that's kept in the office but not in the shared cupboard. If the author wasn't on the cleaning schedule, they might not have known this unspoken rule.\n\nThe author's actions: taking the mug without knowing it was personal, then refusing to switch it without a valid reason (the call was a lie), and returning it after washing. The coworker was upset because the author used a mug that was clearly personal and not part of the shared rotation. Even though there are no explicit rules, the presence of personal items in the breakroom might create an implicit understanding. \n\nSo, the author might have overlooked the personal significance of the mug. While there's no written rule, the coworker had a reason to keep it separate. The author's defense is that the mugs are shared, but since the coworker kept it out of the rotation, maybe the author should have been more careful to distinguish. However, the author didn't know it was his, and the mug was in the drying rack as part of the shared space. The coworker's reaction is harsh maybe because the author didn't consider the mug's personal nature. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's mistake was using a mug that had personal photos without realizing it was someone's personal item. But since there were no explicit rules and the mug was in the shared drying area, the author might not be entirely to blame. However, the coworker's claim that others on the schedule know not to shelve it suggests there was an unspoken understanding. The author, not being on the schedule, might not have been aware, but could be expected to notice that the mug had personal images. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the mug as personal, even if it was in the shared space. Or the coworker might be overreacting since the author reasonably thought it was available. But the coworker's explanation indicates that the mug wasn't meant to be shared, so the author should have been more cautious. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
