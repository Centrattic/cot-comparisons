They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using a coworker's mug. The situation is that the office has a collection of mugs, no official rules, and they're used on a first-come basis. The author took a \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug from the drying rack because the breakroom person hadn't reshelved them yet. The coworker later came to take it back, and there was some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office norms and expectations. Even without written rules, there might be an unspoken understanding. The coworker claimed the mug was his because it had his kids' pictures and he keeps it in his office, implying it's his personal mug. But the author didn't know that at first. So, the key points are: was there an assumption of ownership based on the mug's design and the coworker's behavior?\n\nThe mugs are in a communal space, and the author used one from the drying rack. The coworker said only those on the chore schedule knew not to take his mug. The author isn't part of the chore schedule, so maybe they weren't aware of that unspoken rule. However, the mug had personal photos, which might indicate ownership. The author didn't check if the mug had any personal identifiers before using it. \n\nBut the coworker didn't have the mug in a private area; it was in the communal breakroom. The author might have reasonably thought it was available since others use the mugs freely. However, the coworker's argument is that despite being in the breakroom, it's his personal mug that others know to leave alone. \n\nThe author's actions were to take the first available mug. The coworker felt violated because it was personal. The author then resisted handing it over, leading to tension. The author later returned the mug but was told they were an asshole. \n\nIs the author wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the mug was in a communal space and there were no clear rules against using it, the author might not be at fault. But since the mug had personal content and was kept in the office, maybe the coworker had an expectation of privacy or ownership. However, the coworker didn't mark the mug as his (like with a name), so the author couldn't have known. \n\nThe fact that others on the chore schedule avoid his mug but the author wasn't part of that group complicates things. The coworker didn't communicate the mug's status clearly. In an office setting, assuming a mug is free to use unless stated otherwise is common. The author might not be wrong for using it, but the coworker's reaction is understandable due to the personal nature of the mug. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because there were no explicit rules about mug ownership, and the coworker didn't clearly mark the mug as his. The author acted within the perceived norms of the office. However, the coworker's sensitivity is valid, but that doesn't make the author wrong.\n"
