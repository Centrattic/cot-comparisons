They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using a coworker's mug.\n\nFirst, the situation: the office has a bunch of mugs in the breakroom. No official rules, just first-come-first-served. The author took a mug from the drying rack because the breakroom duty person hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug had the coworker's kids' pictures, so it was clearly his. The coworker asked for it back and the author refused initially but later gave it after a bit of a standoff.\n\nNow, the key points. The mugs are a shared resource, but the specific mug in question had personal photos, implying ownership. Even though the author thought it was a shared mug, the coworker clearly considered it personal. The author didn't check if it was someone's personal mug before using it. Since there's no posted rule about mug usage, but unwritten norms might exist. The coworker's mugs might not be in the breakroom at all, except when being cleaned. So the author used it when it wasn't supposed to be there, maybe against the unspoken rule that the chore folks avoid putting it back. The author's action, while not malicious, was careless. They should have realized it was personal. The coworker's reaction was justified because his personal item was used without permission. The author's argument that it's first-come-first-served doesn't hold because the mug is personal. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
