They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by using their coworker's \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the office has a collection of mugs in the breakroom, and there are no official rules about using them. The author mentions that mugs are on a first-come, first-served basis. They also note that mugs are washed daily and put back in the cupboard, with the chore done by rotating staff. The author isn't on the schedule, so they don't handle that duty.\n\nThe incident happened because the person responsible for breakroom duty that day hadn't reshelved the mugs yet. The author took one from the drying rack, which turned out to be their coworker's mug. The coworker later asked for it back and insisted it wasn't supposed to be used by others. The author initially refused to give it back, then ended up returning it after some back and forth.\n\nNow, considering the office's informal system: if there are no explicit rules against using the mugs, and the author assumed they were free to use any available mug, that seems reasonable. However, the coworker had a personal mug, which might imply it's not meant to be shared. The author might not have been aware of this, but the coworker claims others on the chore schedule know not to use it. But since the author isn't on the schedule, they might not have known about this unspoken rule.\n\nThe key points here are intent and awareness. The author didn't know it was a personal mug when they used it. They acted under the assumption that mugs in the breakroom were shared. The coworker's reaction is strong, but the author didn't intentionally take a personal item. However, once they knew it was the coworker's, they should have returned it immediately. The author's initial refusal to give it back when asked might have been inconsiderate, even if they didn't know beforehand. So, while the coworker's claim about unspoken rules might be valid, the author's actions were based on a lack of knowledge, not malice. But after being informed, not returning the mug promptly could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not returning it immediately upon being asked, but the situation is a bit nuanced.\n"
