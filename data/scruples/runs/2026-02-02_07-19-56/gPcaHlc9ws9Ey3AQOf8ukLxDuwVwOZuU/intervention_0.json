They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for drinking from their coworker's \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The office has a breakroom with mugs that are used on a first-come basis. They're washed and put back. The author took a mug from the drying rack when the person responsible for the breakroom hadn't reshelved them yet. The mug had the coworker's kids' pictures, so it's clear it's his. The coworker confronted the author and asked for the mug, but the author initially refused, then eventually returned it after some back and forth.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author claims there are no rules about mug usage, just first-come. But the coworker says he keeps the mug in his office and only leaves it during breakroom cleanup, and others know not to take it. So there might be an unspoken rule here that even though the mugs are shared, some are personal and not to be used if you know they belong to someone. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they assumed the mug was fair game, not realizing it was personal. However, the coworker could have been more upfront about the mug's status. But the mug clearly has the coworker's family photos, which should indicate it's personal. The author took it without checking, and when confronted, didn't immediately return it, which could be seen as dismissive.\n\nOn the other hand, the office culture has been using mugs on a first-come basis without rules. The author didn't know it was his. But maybe the coworker should have kept it in his office to avoid confusion. However, the coworker's claim that others know not to take it might hold weight. The author's actions led to a conflict, so even if there's no explicit rule, the presence of family photos is a clue. So the author might be at fault for not recognizing the mug's personal nature.\n"
