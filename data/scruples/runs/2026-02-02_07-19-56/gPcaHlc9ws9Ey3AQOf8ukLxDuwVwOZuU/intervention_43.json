They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using their coworker's mug. The scenario is that there's a collection of mugs in the breakroom, no official rules, and they're used on a first-come basis. The author took a mug from the drying rack because the assigned person hadn't reshelved them yet. The coworker later showed up and wanted the mug back because it was his, with his kids' pictures on it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the established norms. The user mentions that mugs are taken as needed and cleaned daily. There's no rule about mug ownership, so maybe the author didn't know it was someone's personal mug. But the coworker argues that others on the cleaning schedule know not to touch his mug, which he keeps in his office. The author didn't know this, so maybe there was an unspoken understanding among the cleaning staff that the mug is personal. But since the author isn't on the cleaning schedule, maybe they weren't aware of this rule.\n\nThe author took the mug without knowing it belonged to the coworker. Even though the mugs are communal, the coworker might have had a reasonable expectation that his mug wouldn't be used, especially since others avoided it. The author's defense is that there were no rules, so they acted according to the observed norm. However, the coworker might feel that leaving the mug out for cleaning should still be considered personal property. \n\nThe key points are: Is there an unwritten rule that the mug is personal? Did the author have a reasonable way to know? The coworker says others on the schedule know not to take it, but the author wasn't part of that group. So maybe the author didn't have a way to know. However, the presence of personal photos might be a hint. The author thought it was weird but didn't question it. Maybe they should have checked if it was someone's mug before using it. \n\nThe coworker's reaction was to take a new mug and ask for the return, which the author refused. The author then washed it and gave it back but was glared at. The coworker might feel disrespected, but the author might think they did nothing wrong under the existing system. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author's action was a common practice in the office, but the coworker had a personal item that others respected. The author might be at fault for not recognizing that the mug was personal, even without explicit rules. However, the coworker could have made it clearer that it's his personal mug. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the coworker's expectations were reasonable. Since others on the cleaning schedule knew not to take it, but the author wasn't part of that group, maybe the author wasn't at fault. However, the photos on the mug should have been a clue. Maybe the author should have asked if it was someone's mug before using it. So, perhaps the author is partially at fault. But since there were no rules, maybe not entirely. The situation is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the author took a mug that had the coworker's face on it, even if they didn't know, it's possible the author should have been more cautious. So I'm leaning towards AITA being in the wrong, answer A.\n"
