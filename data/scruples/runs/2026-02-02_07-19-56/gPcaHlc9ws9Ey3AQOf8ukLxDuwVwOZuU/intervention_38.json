They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u00a0\n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot.\u00a0\n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I\u00a0 thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office.\u00a0\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\"\u00a0\n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee.\u00a0\n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\"\u00a0\n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today.\u00a0\n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\"\u00a0\n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took the mug is in the wrong. The situation is about an office breakroom with various mugs that are used on a first-come basis. The person took a mug with \"World's Greatest Dad\" and some photos of their coworker's kids. The coworker later asked for it back, and the person argued that they didn't know it was his.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the office's norms. The user mentions that mugs are used first-come, first-served, and there's no mention of ownership. They also note that mugs are washed and reshelved daily, with no specific rules about mug usage. The person in question, as a senior staff, isn't on the chore schedule but has contributed mugs from conferences. So, there's a general assumption that mugs are communal.\n\nThe key point here is whether the mug was intended to be personal property. The coworker claims that he keeps it in his office and only leaves it out for the breakroom cleanup. However, the user didn't know that. The mug was in the drying rack, part of the shared collection. If others on the chore schedule knew not to shelve his mug, but others didn't, that's an inconsistency. But the user wasn't part of the chore schedule, so they might not be aware of this unspoken rule.\n\nThe person took the mug without knowing it was personal. The coworker's argument is that the photos and caption indicated ownership. But the user didn't recognize that until later. The main issue is whether there was an established rule that certain mugs are personal. If there's no explicit rule, then the user might not be at fault. However, once they found out, they could have been more accommodating to return the mug immediately instead of waiting until they were done. The coworker felt disrespected, maybe because the mug is personal, but the user didn't know that at first.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong because there's no rule stating personal mugs, but their handling of the situation after the request might have been better. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with nuances. However, the initial act of taking the mug without knowing it's personal might not be their fault, but the refusal to give it up immediately after being asked could be seen as rude. But the question is whether they're \"in the wrong,\" which is more about the action rather than the reaction. Since the office norms allowed communal use, the initial action isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
