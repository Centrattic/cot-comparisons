Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is at fault here. So, the situation is about a coffee shop incident where the author had a family with an autistic child thrown out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author was working in the coffee shop, using their laptop with earphones. A family with a child entered, and the kid pulled out the author's earphones and later spilled a drink on the laptop. The parents didn't apologize, so the author told the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. There's some conflict here about the parents' behavior and how the author handled the situation.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility for their child's actions. The dad even laughed and told the author to dry the spill himself. That's pretty disrespectful. The author had a right to be upset because their work could have been damaged. The manager probably acted appropriately by asking them to leave since the parents weren't addressing the issue.\n\nHowever, the author did end up cursing back at the dad and clapped mockingly. That's not the best response. Also, the mom called the author a jerk for the child being autistic, so maybe the author could have handled it more calmly. But the parents were in the wrong for letting the kid cause damage without any accountability. The author's main issue was the parents' lack of responsibility, not the child's autism. The child was just a victim of bad parenting here.\n\nSo, the author's actions in reporting the incident to the manager were reasonable. The manager's decision to have them leave was probably fair. The author's anger and cursing back might be a point against them, but the parents' behavior was worse. The child isn't at fault; it's the parents. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves when the parents didn't help. The answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
