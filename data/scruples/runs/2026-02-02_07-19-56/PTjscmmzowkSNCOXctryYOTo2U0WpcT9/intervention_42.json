Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who had a family with an autistic child kicked out of a coffee shop. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the context: the author was in a coffee shop, working on their laptop with earphones. A family enters, and the child unplugs their earphones violently. The parents seem to be arguing about cheating, which is loud. The kid spills a drink on the author's laptop and phone. The parents don't apologize, and the dad even laughs and tells the author to dry it with a napkin. The author then reports the family to the manager, leading to them being asked to leave. The dad gets angry, the mom calls the author a jerk for targeting the autistic kid, and the author curses back. The kid was crying, and the parents dragged him away. The author feels bad later but is unsure if they're at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\n1. The child's behavior: The kid is autistic. The parents might be dealing with challenges, and the child's actions (unplugging earphones, spilling drinks) might be due to sensory issues or lack of understanding. The author speculates the child might be on the spectrum before it's confirmed, which might not be the best approach, but it's a common scenario.\n\n2. Parental responsibility: The parents left the child alone while ordering. When the spill happens, the dad's response is dismissive and even mocking. The mom is also smug. The parents aren't taking responsibility for their child's actions, which could be a problem. The author might feel wronged because the parents aren't addressing the issue.\n\n3. The manager's role: The author approaches the manager after the spill. The manager asks the family to leave. The dad's aggressive reaction and the mom's accusation that the author targeted the child because he's autistic are important. The author's reaction of cursing back might be seen as escalating the situation.\n\n4. The author's perspective: They mention being generally reserved and observant. They tried to ignore the family initially. The parents' dismissiveness after the spill led to the confrontation. The author's actions led to the family being kicked out, which the mom attributes to the child's autism. The author feels conflicted because they later feel bad for the child.\n\nPossible angles to consider:\n\n- The parents' behavior: Are they neglectful? If they're not supervising their child properly, maybe they share some responsibility. However, the child's actions might be beyond control due to autism, which requires understanding. The parents might be under stress from their own issues (the cheating argument), which could explain their dismissiveness.\n\n- The author's actions: Reporting the family to the manager is a reasonable step if their property was damaged. However, the author curses back, which is unprofessional and escalates tension. The mom's accusation that they targeted the child because of autism is a valid concern. The author didn't know about the child's autism until the mom mentioned it, so the accusation might be baseless, but the author's actions could be seen as discriminatory if they assumed the child was a problem because of his autism.\n\n- Legal vs. ethical aspects: The parents are responsible for their child's actions. If the child damaged the author's property, the parents should take responsibility. But in a public space, there's also a balance between protecting individuals and not discriminating against those with disabilities. The ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) might require reasonable accommodations, so kicking out a family because of a child's disability could be problematic. However, the manager's action was based on the parents' failure to control their child, not the child's disability directly.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the manager decided to ask the family to leave because the parents weren't managing their child, then the author's report might be justified. However, the author's own cursing and the mom's accusation about autism could indicate a bias. If the author had the child's autism in mind when reporting, that might be discriminatory. The key is whether the author's actions were based on the parents' failure to supervise rather than the child's disability. The author mentions suspecting autism before the mom says it, which might mean they assumed the child was a problem and reported the family, leading to the mom's accusation. If the author's intent was to target the child because of autism, then they are at fault. But if it was about the parents' inaction, maybe not.\n\nBut the author's reaction of cursing back shows poor emotional control. Also, the manager is the appropriate person to handle such situations, so reporting them is okay, but the author's personal reaction might not be. The main question is whether the author's actions were justified in the context of the parents' behavior. The child's actions were problematic, but the parents' response was dismissive. The author might blame the parents, so their actions could be reasonable. However, the mom's accusation that they targeted the child because of autism could have merit if the author's intent was to get the family removed due to the child's disability, but the author might not have that intent. Without more info, it's hard to say. The author's mention of suspecting autism before knowing for sure might indicate a bias.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions in reporting the family to the manager might be justified if the parents weren't taking responsibility. However, the author's reaction (cursing) and potential bias (assuming autism led to the child's behavior) might make them partially at fault. The mom's accusation could be unfounded, but the author's actions could have been influenced by a lack of understanding of autism. So, there's a mix here. However, since the manager took action based on the parents' failure to control their child, the author's report might be reasonable. The key issue is whether the author's actions were discriminatory. Since the author didn't know the child was autistic until the mom mentioned it, the accusation might be incorrect, but the author's initial assumption could still contribute to a negative perception. The answer might hinge on whether the report was based on the parents' behavior rather than the child's disability. Given that, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting the parents but is in the wrong for the cursing and the initial assumption. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. Since the main action was reporting to the manager, which could be justified, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But considering the cursing and potential bias, maybe A. It's a bit tricky. The user thinks A, but I'm leaning towards B because the manager's decision was based on the parents' inaction, not the child's disability. The author's personal reaction is a flaw, but the main action (reporting) might be acceptable.\n"
