Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a person at a coffee shop dealing with a family, including a kid with autism. The key points are:\n\n1. The kid unplugs the author's earphones and then throws them. The author suspects autism but isn't sure.\n2. The parents are arguing loudly about cheating. The author overhears this.\n3. The kid spills a drink on the author's laptop. The author confronts the dad, who responds dismissively.\n4. The author tells the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad becomes abusive, and the author curses back. The mom accuses the author of targeting a child with autism.\n5. The author feels bad later for the kid.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, consider the kid's actions. If the child has autism, he might have different behaviors, possibly due to sensory issues or lack of social awareness. The parents' response is dismissive, which could indicate poor parenting. The author's reaction: reporting the incident to the manager is reasonable if property is damaged. However, the author's initial judgment about the dad being a \"prick\" and the cursing back might be problematic. Also, the parents might have felt the manager acted unfairly, especially if the child's behavior was due to disability. The mom's accusation adds a layer of possible discrimination. The author didn't know about the autism until the mom mentioned it, but even so, the response to the damage is something the manager should handle. The author might have overreacted by getting angry and cursing, which isn't professional. However, the parents' behavior was also inconsiderate. \n\nBut the core issue is responsibility. The parents are responsible for their child's actions. The author's earphones were taken, then the laptop was spilled. The author reported it, which is appropriate. The manager's decision to ask them to leave is up to their discretion. The author's cursing back could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. Also, the mom's comment implies that the author targeted the child because of autism, which the author might not have known at the time. However, the author's actions led to the family being ejected, possibly without full context. The author might have overstepped by confronting them directly and then involving the manager. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the parents are definitely at fault for not supervising their child and being dismissive. The author's actions to protect their property are understandable, but the manner in which they handled it\u2014especially the cursing and public confrontation\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have contributed to the escalation. However, the parents' behavior was also inappropriate. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author acted appropriately given the circumstances. The author had the right to report property damage, but the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. Since the child has autism, the parents might need more understanding, but their own actions (shoving the kid, dismissive attitude) were wrong. The author might be partially at fault for the reaction, but the parents are mostly to blame. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author's actions were in response to the parents' negligence. But the escalation (cursing) is their fault. So, perhaps A (author is in the wrong) because they could have handled it more calmly, but maybe not entirely. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) because the parents were at fault. It's a bit tricky. The key is whether the author had the right to report the incident. Since the parents didn't take responsibility, the author's action was justified. The cursing is a separate issue. The main question is about the author's right to have them thrown out. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parents were negligent, but the author's cursing was inappropriate. But the initial action of reporting the incident is okay. The main question is about throwing the family out. The manager decided that, so maybe the author isn't at fault. The answer is B.\n"
