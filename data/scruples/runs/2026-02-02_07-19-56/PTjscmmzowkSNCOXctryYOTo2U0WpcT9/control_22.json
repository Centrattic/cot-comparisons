Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family with an autistic child being thrown out of a coffee shop. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author was in the coffee shop, working on their laptop. The family comes in, and the parents leave the kid alone. The kid unplug their earphones violently and throws them back. The author handles it calmly, but then the kid spills a drink on their laptop. The parents don't apologize, the dad makes a sarcastic comment. The author reports the incident to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. There's some conflict, the dad gives the finger, the author curses back, and the mom blames the manager for targeting their autistic child.\n\nSo, the key points here: the kid's actions caused damage to the author's property. The parents didn't take responsibility, and the author felt justified in involving the manager. The main question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, the kid is autistic, which might mean he's not in control of his actions. The parents might have had trouble managing him. But the parents didn't step in when the kid spilled the drink, and the dad's response was dismissive. The author's laptop could have been damaged, leading to loss of work. Reporting to the manager is a reasonable step to protect their property.\n\nHowever, the dad's behavior (shoving the kid earlier) and the parents' lack of accountability might have contributed. The author did try to ignore the situation at first. When confronted, the parents didn't take responsibility. The manager's decision to ask them to leave was probably based on the parents' negligence.\n\nBut when the author cursed back, that's a problem. Also, the mom's comment about autism adds another layer. The author didn't know the kid was autistic until then. Maybe they should have waited for the parents to handle the spill, rather than immediately involving the manager. But the parents didn't act, so the author had a right to protect their property.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were a response to the parents' neglect and the kid's direct harm. However, the way they reacted (cursing) might have escalated things. But the main issue was the parents not taking responsibility. So, the author isn't entirely wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance. The parents had a bigger share of responsibility.\n"
