Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The person is at a coffee shop working with their laptop and earphones. A family enters, and the dad shoves the kid when they sit. Then the parents leave the kid unattended, who pulls out the earphones and spills a drink on the laptop and phone. The dad laughs and says to dry it with a napkin, so the author tells the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad argues and gives a finger, the author curses back, and there's a mention of the kid possibly having autism.\n\nFirst, the kid's actions: pulling earphones and spilling a drink. That's definitely problematic, especially if it damaged the laptop. But the parents' response is key. The dad laughed and didn't apologize, which is unacceptable. The author approached the manager, which is a reasonable step when a parent isn't taking responsibility. The manager then asked the family to leave, which the dad resists. The author's cursing back and slow clap might be where they start to take it too far, but their initial action of reporting the incident to the manager seems justified.\n\nNow, considering the kid's possible autism. Children with autism might not understand social cues or have impulse control. But the parents' behavior is a separate issue. The parents should have supervised their child and addressed the spillage. The author might have been in the right to involve the manager, but the way they handled it, especially cursing and the slow clap, could be seen as excessive. However, the parents weren't cooperating, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The parents for not controlling their child and being disrespectful. The author for escalating with cursing and public gestures. But the main issue is the parents' negligence. The author's actions were a reaction to that, so maybe not entirely their fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The manager's involvement was appropriate, but the author's personal response (cursing, slow clap) could be problematic. However, the parents provoked it. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's initial action of reporting the incident was correct. The follow-up actions might be in the wrong, but the main issue is the parents' behavior. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the parents were the primary issue, but the author's response could be seen as harsh. However, the manager handled the ejection, so maybe the author isn't to blame for that part. The cursing and slow clap are their own fault, but the initial report was justified. Hmm, tricky. The key is whether the author should have handled it differently. Since the parents were dismissive, the manager's intervention was necessary. The author's personal reactions might not make them in the wrong, but perhaps they overreacted. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents were unresponsive and the child's actions were harmful, so the author's action to protect their work and the premises was appropriate. The follow-up behavior (cursing) is their own choice but might not negate the initial rightness of the action.\n"
