Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by having the family of a child with autism thrown out of a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the author was at a coffee shop, working on their laptop with earphones. The family came in, and the child pulled out their earphones and later spilled a drink on their laptop and phone. The parents didn't apologize, which led the author to report them to the manager, resulting in the family being asked to leave. The author feels conflicted, especially after learning the child has autism.\n\nI need to consider a few points. The child's actions were disruptive, but the parents' response (not apologizing, even laughing) is concerning. The author's reaction\u2014reporting the family to the manager\u2014could be seen as necessary to protect their work, but the escalation with cursing might be an issue. Also, the parents' behavior towards their autistic child could be a factor in how responsible they are for the child's actions.\n\nThe key is whether the author overstepped. The manager is in charge, so reporting the incident is appropriate. However, the author's direct confrontation and the eventual cursing might have contributed to the conflict. The parents might not have handled the situation well, but the author's role was to report the incident, not to eject the family themselves. The fact that the child has autism adds nuance\u2014maybe the child couldn't control their actions, but the parents' lack of responsibility is a separate issue.\n\nIn the end, the author's initial action (reporting the spill) was justified, but the public confrontation and cursing could be seen as wrong. The manager handled the ejection, so the author isn't entirely at fault for the outcome. However, the author's response was aggressive, which might make them partially at fault. But the parents' behavior also played a role. It's a mixed situation, but since the author didn't cause the child's actions and took steps through the manager, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the cursing was definitely inappropriate. So, it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the parents were at fault for not handling their child.\n"
