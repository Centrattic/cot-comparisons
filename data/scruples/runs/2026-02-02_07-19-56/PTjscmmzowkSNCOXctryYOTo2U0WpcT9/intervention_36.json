Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child at a coffee shop. The author, who was working, had their earphones yanked off by the kid, then the kid spilled drinks on the laptop. The parents didn't apologize, so the author reported them, leading to the family being kicked out. The parents reacted angrily, with the dad giving the finger and the mom accusing the author of targeting the autistic child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both sides. The parents: they left the kid alone, he did some destructive things, and when confronted, they didn't show any remorse. The dad even laughed and told the author to dry it with a napkin. The mom stayed silent. That's pretty bad parenting. The kid might be autistic, but the parents' response was dismissive. The author, on the other hand, tried to handle it calmly, approached the manager, and only reacted when the kid spilled the drink. However, after the manager intervened, the author cursed back at the dad. That might have been uncalled for, but the dad provoked him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the manager was the one who actually told the family to leave. The author didn't directly throw them out; they just reported the incident. The parents' actions were inexcusable, but the author's reaction of cursing back could be seen as escalating the situation. However, given the parents' behavior, maybe the author's frustration was justified. The mom's comment about the kid having autism adds another layer. The author didn't know the child was autistic until the mom mentioned it. So, was the author wrong to act based on the parents' poor behavior? It's a bit of a gray area. The author might have overreacted by cursing, but the main issue is the parents' lack of responsibility. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parents were at fault, but the author's choice of words could have been better. The key point is that the parents didn't take responsibility, which justifies the report to the manager.\n"
