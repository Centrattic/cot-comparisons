Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child being thrown out of a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the author was working in a coffee shop. The family comes in, and the kid, who is autistic, unplugs the author's earphones and later spills a drink on their laptop. The parents seem dismissive, even smirking when told. The author reports them to the manager, the family is asked to leave, and there's some conflict. The kid ends up crying, and the parents react angrily. The author feels remorse later.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are: the parents' behavior. They didn't apologize when the kid caused damage, which could be a sign of neglect or poor parenting. The author was in a public place where they have a right to work. The kid's actions were disruptive, but given autism, maybe the parents should have managed him better. However, the author reacting by confronting the parents and getting the family thrown out could be seen as harsh. But the parents were complicit by not taking responsibility. The manager's role is also a factor\u2014they asked the family to leave, which might have been appropriate given the situation.\n\nThe author might feel justified because the parents weren't holding up their end. But the kid was being punished for his parents' negligence. However, the author did report the incident through proper channels (manager), so maybe that's not wrong. The cursing and slow clap might be over the top, but the main action was the manager's decision. The parents' actions were worse, so the author isn't entirely to blame. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like speaking to the parents first or being more patient. But given the parents' dismissive attitude, the author's actions were a reasonable response. So, the answer might be B (not wrong), but there's nuance. The final answer should weigh the parents' responsibility versus the author's actions.\n"
