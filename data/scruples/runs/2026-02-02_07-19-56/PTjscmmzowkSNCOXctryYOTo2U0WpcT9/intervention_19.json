Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coffee shop incident where a kid with autism is involved. The author describes the situation where the family's child disrupts their work, spills drinks, and the parents don't take responsibility. The author reports the family to the manager, leading to them being thrown out, and then some angry exchanges happen.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of the author. The kid pulled the earphones out, spilled drinks, and the parents didn't apologize. The author went to the manager, which is a reasonable step when someone is causing issues. However, the key point here is the child's age and the parents' responsibility. \n\nThe author mentions suspecting the kid is on the autism spectrum, which might mean he has specific needs. The parents not taking responsibility could be a problem. But the author's response was to have the family removed, which might be seen as overstepping if the child's behavior is due to a disability. The parents' argument about the cheating adds context about their own issues, but it's not clear if that affects their responsibility to manage their child.\n\nThe author's anger led to cursing back and a slow clap, which is unprofessional and could escalate the situation. However, the initial action of reporting to the manager was justified. The mom's comment about the kid having autism makes the author realize the situation. The question is whether throwing the family out was the right move. \n\nConsidering that the parents didn't address the damages, the author's actions might be seen as necessary to protect their work. On the other hand, public shaming or anger could be seen as wrong. But since the manager was involved, it's more about the manager's decision. The author's personal reaction might not be the main factor here. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for involving the manager, but their personal response (cursing, slow clap) could be problematic. However, the main issue is whether the action of having them thrown out was justified. Given the parents' lack of responsibility, maybe not. But the child's autism should be considered in terms of the parents' duty to manage their child's behavior. \n\nIn the end, the answer might hinge on the balance between protecting one's property and considering the child's needs. But since the parents didn't take responsibility, the author's action could be seen as justified. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Need to check again. The key here is the parents' responsibility versus the author's right to protect their work. Since the parents didn't act, the author's action was a reasonable step. So, the answer is B.\n"
