Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for having a family of a kid with autism thrown out of a coffee shop. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author was at a coffee shop, working with earphones. A family enters, and the kid (who later is confirmed to have autism) unplugs their earphones violently, then throws them. Later, the kid spills a drink on the author's laptop and phone. The parents don't apologize, the dad even tells the author to dry it with a napkin. The author reports the family to the manager, who asks them to leave. The dad gets angry, gives a finger, author curses back. Mom calls them a jerk for kicking out a kid with autism. The author feels bad for the kid.\n\nNow, the key points here. The kid's behavior: unplugging earphones violently, spilling drinks. But is this due to his autism? The author suspected it, but the mom confirmed it. The parents' response: dad laughs, says dry with napkin, mom does nothing. The author approached the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad's aggressive reaction and the mom's accusation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's think. The parents are responsible for their child's actions. Even if the kid is autistic, parents should manage their child's behavior. If the kid spilled something, parents should apologize and clean up. The dad's response was dismissive and rude. The author was within their right to report the incident to the manager. The manager then decided to ask the family to leave. The author's actions were a reasonable response to protect their property and work. However, cursing back might have escalated things, but the main issue is whether the manager's action was justified. The parents' behavior (argument, not addressing the spills, dad's aggression) might have contributed. But the kid's actions were the initial problem. The author didn't directly confront the parents except to inform the manager. So, the manager made the decision, so the author isn't solely responsible. Maybe the parents are at fault for not handling their child, but the author isn't wrong for seeking help from the manager. However, some might argue that the author should have been more patient or tried to understand the autism aspect first. But the parents didn't take responsibility. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
