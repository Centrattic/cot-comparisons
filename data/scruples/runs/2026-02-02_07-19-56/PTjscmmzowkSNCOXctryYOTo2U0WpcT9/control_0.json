Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author was working on their laptop with earphones. The family entered, and the kid pulled out their earphones and later spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't apologize, even laughed. The author told the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, and the kid was autistic. The author feels conflicted because the kid might not be at fault, but the parents were negligent.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The kid's actions were disruptive. However, since he's autistic, his behavior might be due to his condition. The parents' responsibility is key here. If they didn't supervise the kid properly and even mocked the author's complaints, that's a problem. The author tried to handle it politely but escalated when the parents were dismissive. The manager intervened, which might be standard procedure for property damage. \n\nBut was the author overreacting? If the kid's actions were due to autism, the parents might need more understanding. However, the parents' response was aggressive, and the kid's actions caused potential damage. The author's reaction might be justified in protecting their work. The real issue is the parents' behavior, not the kid's. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't target the kid specifically but addressed the situation with the manager. However, the cursing and slow clap might have been inappropriate. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's main action was reporting the incident, which is reasonable. The parents and kid were the ones causing the problem. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
