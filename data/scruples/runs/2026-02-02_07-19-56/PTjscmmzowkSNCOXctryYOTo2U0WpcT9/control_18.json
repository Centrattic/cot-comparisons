Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who was at a coffee shop and ended up having a family with a kid who has autism thrown out. The author is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, let's break down the events. The author was working on their laptop with earphones. A family comes in, and the kid, who might be autistic, pulls out their earphones. The author reacts politely, but the kid throws them. Then later, the kid spills a drink on the author's laptop. The parents don't seem to apologize, instead, the dad makes a sarcastic comment. The author goes to the manager, the family is asked to leave, the dad gets angry, there's some cursing, and the author even claps sarcastically.\n\nNow, the key points here. The kid's behavior is disruptive. The parents aren't intervening to correct the kid's actions. The author's response was to involve the manager. But the kid has autism, which might mean he doesn't understand social norms or the consequences of his actions. So, the parents' responsibility is in question here. Were they adequately supervising the child? Did they acknowledge the damage and apologize, or were they dismissive?\n\nThe author's actions: They tried to politely inform the dad about the spill, but when the dad didn't respond properly, they went to the manager. That seems reasonable. However, there's the part where the author cursed back at the dad and did a sarcastic clap. That might escalate the situation and could be seen as unprofessional or aggressive. Also, the mom's comment about the kid having autism is important. The author didn't know about the autism initially, but once they did, they felt bad. \n\nBut wait, even if the kid has autism, the parents are still responsible for their child's behavior. If they didn't take responsibility for the spill, or tried to downplay it, the author had a right to involve the manager. However, the way the author reacted\u2014cursing and the slow clap\u2014might be seen as overreacting. The manager's role is to handle such situations, so the author might have been within their rights to inform them, but their personal response (cursing) is questionable.\n\nAlso, the parents' behavior: the dad shoved the kid earlier, which isn't good parenting. Their dismissive attitude towards the spill and arguing in public could indicate poor conduct. The kid was left unattended at the table, leading to the spill. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are at fault for not managing their child's actions. However, the author's actions of involving the manager were appropriate, but their personal reaction (cursing and sarcastic clap) could be seen as inappropriate, even if they were upset. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. The initial action of reporting to the manager isn't wrong, but the way they handled their anger might be. The kid being autistic doesn't excuse the parents' lack of responsibility, but the author's response might have been too harsh. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the parents were not taking responsibility, the author's decision to involve the manager was justified. The author's personal reaction (cursing and clap) might be inappropriate, but the main action (getting the family to leave) was the manager's call, which the author reported. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for the main action, but their behavior in the aftermath could be seen as contributing to the problem. However, the core issue is the parents' failure to control their child and apologize. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the incident to the manager. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
