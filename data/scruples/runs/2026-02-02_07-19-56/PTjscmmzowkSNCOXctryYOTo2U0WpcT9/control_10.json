Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a kid with autism whose family was asked to leave a coffee shop. The author, who was eating alone and working, had their earphones yanked and then their phone and laptop spilled on by the kid. The parents didn't apologize and even laughed it off. The author then complained to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The kid was crying, and the parents reacted angrily, with the dad giving the finger and the mom accusing the author of targeting a kid with autism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The parents' behavior is a key point. They didn't take responsibility when their child caused damage. The father shoved the kid initially, which might indicate poor parenting. When the kid spilled the drinks, the parents didn't apologize, laughed instead, and the dad gave a rude gesture. That's pretty inconsiderate and possibly negligent in supervising their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was working and trying to focus. The kid's actions were disruptive and damaging, and the parents' lack of accountability is a problem. The author did approach the manager, which is a reasonable step when someone else's actions are harming them. The manager asked the family to leave, which is within their rights to maintain the establishment's environment. \n\nThe author's response to the dad's aggression by cursing back and doing a slow clap could be seen as escalating the situation, but the initial trigger was the parents' refusal to take responsibility. The author didn't physically confront them but used strong language. The question is whether the author overstepped by involving the manager. The manager's decision to remove the family was based on the incident, which could be considered a breach of the shop's policies regarding disturbances.\n\nConsidering the parents' behavior and the potential intent to protect other customers, the author's actions might be justified. However, there's a nuance in handling situations involving children with autism, who might have behaviors that are beyond their control. The parents' lack of intervention and their hostile response are problematic. The author's anger is understandable given the damage to their work and the parents' attitude. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The parents didn't apologize, and the manager acted based on the situation. The key here is whether the author's actions were a proportional response. Reporting the incident to management is appropriate. The conflict escalation with the dad is more of a personal reaction, but the main issue is the manager's decision. The parents were at fault for not taking responsibility, and the manager handled it. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking resolution through the manager. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a debate about handling it more calmly. However, given the parents' inconsiderate behavior, the author's actions are justified.\n"
