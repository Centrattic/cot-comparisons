Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting a family with an autistic child thrown out of a coffee shop. The story is detailed, so I need to consider several angles.\n\nFirst, the parents left their child unattended while ordering. That's a red flag. If a child is autistic, they might have sensory or behavioral challenges, so leaving them unattended could be risky. The child unplugged the author's earphones, which led to a spill. The author approached the dad, who didn't take responsibility, even laughed, and told him to use a napkin. The dad's response seems dismissive and possibly inconsiderate. The author then reports the family to the manager, leading to their removal. The dad's aggression and the mom's accusation that the author targeted the autistic child are also points to consider.\n\nThe author mentions feeling bad about the child but still took action. The key here is whether the actions were justified. The parents' behavior was neglectful, and the dad's lack of apology or responsibility might have contributed to the author's decision. However, the author's reaction of cursing and giving the finger could be seen as inappropriate, even if provoked. Also, the mom's comment about the child having autism suggests the author didn't know beforehand, which might mitigate some blame but doesn't absolve them if the parents were at fault.\n\nAutism considerations: The child might not have understood the social norms or the impact of their actions. If the parents knew their child had autism, they should have been more attentive and prepared for such situations. The parents' failure to manage their child's behavior responsibly is a significant factor. The author's decision to involve the manager was a response to the parents' negligence and the direct harm to their property.\n\nBut was it the author's place to escalate the situation? The parents didn't take responsibility, so the author might have a valid reason to protect their work. However, the public shaming by getting them thrown out and the confrontational behavior might be excessive. The balance between standing up for oneself and respecting the child's needs is tricky. The author's regret at the end shows they recognize potential issues, but the action was taken in response to the parents' actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents' negligence and the dad's behavior were problematic. The author's actions, while perhaps overzealous, might be justified given the circumstances. However, the method of resolution (confrontation, cursing) could be seen as inconsiderate towards the child. But since the parents were at fault, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. So, likely answer is B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
