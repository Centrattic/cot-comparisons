Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The author is the one who reported them.\n\nFirst, the kid had some incidents: pulling out the author's earphones and spilling a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility, which led the author to involve the manager. The kid was crying when they left, and the parents were rude in return.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The kid has autism, so his actions might be due to his condition. Autistic kids might not understand social boundaries or personal space as well as others. The parents might need more understanding or guidance rather than being blamed for their child's behavior. However, the parents did have a role here. They left the kid unattended, didn't intervene when he removed the earphones, and didn't apologize when the spill happened. The dad even made a sarcastic comment. \n\nThe author, on their part, tried to handle it politely at first. But when the situation escalated, they took action by informing the manager. The manager then asked the family to leave. The author's anger led them to curse back and clap sarcastically, which might be seen as harsh. \n\nIs the author wrong for reporting the family? Well, the kid's actions did cause damage, and the parents didn't take responsibility. The manager's decision to ask them to leave was likely based on the parents' inaction. But the way the author handled the aftermath\u2014cursing and clapping\u2014could be seen as unprofessional and unkind, especially considering the child's needs. \n\nHowever, the parents' behavior also contributed. They might not have been properly managing their child's needs, which is important for any parent, especially when in public. The author might have felt wronged due to potential work loss, but reacting with anger and public confrontation isn't ideal. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the parents failed to supervise and support their child adequately, leading to the incidents. The author escalated the situation with an angry response, which might not have been the best approach, but the initial action of involving the manager was reasonable. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their reaction could have been handled better. However, the main issue is whether they should have taken responsibility for the kid being thrown out. Since the parents weren't taking responsibility, the manager's decision was appropriate. Therefore, the author's action was justified, but their reaction was excessive. So the answer might be B, but I need to check if the initial action was right. Alternatively, maybe the author should have handled it differently, like speaking to the parents first. But the parents didn't respond, so involving the manager was necessary. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the parents were neglectful, the author isn't entirely at fault. So answer B.\n"
