Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic child thrown out of a coffee shop. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was working at a coffee shop when a family entered. The parents left the autistic child alone, who then unplugged the author's earphones and spilled a drink on the laptop. The parents didn't apologize, leading the author to report them to the manager. The dad got angry, argued, and the author cursed back. The mom blamed the author for the child being kicked out.\n\nNow, considering the parents' actions. Leaving a child alone in a public place could be a safety issue. The child's behavior (unplugging earphones, spilling) might be due to autism, but the parents' response was dismissive. They didn't apologize or take responsibility. The dad even mocked the author. \n\nThe author's reaction: They approached the manager when the parents didn't act. The manager asked the family to leave. The author's anger led to cursing, which might be a misstep, but the main issue is the parents' lack of responsibility. \n\nAutism considerations: The child might have sensory issues or not understand social norms. However, the parents' failure to manage their child's behavior is a factor. The author's actions were in response to a lack of accountability from the parents. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author wasn't wrong to report the incident, especially since the parents weren't addressing the problem. However, cursing back might have escalated things. But the manager handled the removal, so maybe the author's role is justified. The parents' behavior was worse. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The parents were negligent, and the author took appropriate steps. The curse was a lapse but not the main issue.\n"
