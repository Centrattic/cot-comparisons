Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child causing disturbances at a coffee shop, and the author reports them to the manager, leading to them being thrown out. The author is conflicted and asking for advice.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was working, the child had autism, there was a spill, the parents didn't apologize, and the author involved the manager. The question is whether the author acted wrongly by getting the family removed.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the parents didn't take responsibility, which is frustrating. The child's actions were disruptive, possibly due to his condition. The author might have felt their work was at risk. On the other hand, the child has autism, and the situation might have been a result of his behavior, not intentional malice. The parents' reaction (not apologizing, arguing) is concerning, but the author's response involved cursing and getting the family kicked out, which could be seen as harsh, especially given the child's needs. \n\nThe manager's role is important. The author approached the manager, which is a proper step. The manager's decision to ask them to leave might have been appropriate if the situation was disruptive. However, the author's reaction in cursing back could be problematic. The mom's comment about the child having autism makes the author reconsider, showing awareness of the child's needs. But the act of getting the family removed might have been justified if the parents weren't addressing the issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are at fault for not managing their child's behavior and not apologizing. The author's responsibility is in how they handled the situation. While the initial action (reporting to the manager) is reasonable, the follow-up (cursing) is not. So maybe the author is partially at fault for the escalation, but not entirely for the initial report. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nAutism considerations are important. The child might not understand social norms, so the parents should have been more attentive. The author might have overreacted by not giving the parents a chance to correct the behavior immediately. However, since the parents didn't respond, the manager's intervention was appropriate. The author's actions might be seen as necessary, but the cursing and public confrontation could be seen as unprofessional. \n\nIn summary, the author's intent was to protect their work and address the disturbance, which is understandable. The manager's role is to handle such situations, so involving the manager was correct. However, the personal confrontation (cursing) is where the author went wrong. So the answer could lean towards A, but the initial action might not be entirely wrong. However, the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, so I need to see if that's accurate.\n"
