Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with a child who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The writer is the one who reported them to the manager after the kid spilled drinks on their laptop and the parents didn't apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The parents had a child who was disruptive\u2014unplugging earphones and spilling drinks. The child might have autism, which can affect behavior. The parents' response (not apologizing, even smirking) is concerning. The writer felt their work was at risk, so they contacted the manager. The manager then asked the family to leave, which led to an argument and the writer cursing back.\n\nThe key points here are: the parents' lack of supervision, their dismissive attitude towards the damage, and the child's possible autism. The writer's actions were to protect their property and work. However, the way the manager handled it might have been appropriate. The writer's cursing back and the mom calling them a jerk because of the child's autism adds complexity. The writer later felt bad about the kid.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the parents are definitely at fault for not managing their child and not apologizing. The writer's decision to report the family to the manager is a reasonable response when the parents aren't taking responsibility. However, cursing back might escalate the situation. But the main issue was the parents' behavior. So the answer might hinge on whether the writer was justified in reporting them. Since the parents were not protecting the child's actions and were dismissive, the writer might not be in the wrong for taking action. But if the child's autism was a factor in the behavior, maybe there's more nuance. However, the parents' responsibility to supervise still stands. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a debate.\n"
