Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The author is the one who complained to the manager and caused them to be asked to leave. \n\nFirst, the kid did some things that upset the author. He took their earphones, spilled a drink on the laptop, and the parents didn't seem to apologize. The author approached the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, the mom called the author a jerk for the kid being autistic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the kid's behavior was disruptive. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility, which is a problem. The author was trying to work and had their equipment damaged. The parents' lack of accountability might justify the author's actions.\n\nBut then, the kid has autism, which might mean he couldn't control his impulses. The author realized the kid was autistic later. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Also, the author confronted the dad, leading to a confrontation where they both got angry. The author's reaction of cursing and the slow clap might have escalated things.\n\nThe manager's decision to ask them to leave was a professional action. The author provided the reason, but maybe they should have handled it differently, like talking to the parents first instead of immediately involving the manager. However, the parents didn't respond to the author's initial complaints. \n\nThe mom's accusation that the author targeted the kid because of autism is a concern. The author might have acted based on the kid's condition, but the parents' behavior also played a role. The key points are the parents' lack of support and the damage to the author's property. \n\nIn the end, while the parents are clearly at fault for not managing their child and the rude behavior, the author's actions in escalating the situation and possibly stigmatizing the autistic child might make them partially responsible. But since the parents were the main issue, the author might not be entirely wrong. However, directly involving the manager without trying to resolve it with the parents first could be a point against the author. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it the best way, but maybe B (No) because the parents were in the wrong. Wait, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents' behavior was bad, but the author did report them to the manager, leading to them being thrown out. The author might have acted in self-defense regarding their work materials. But maybe they should have been more patient. Considering the context, the author might not be entirely wrong. However, the way they handled it could have been better. The answer could be A or B. \n\nBut the key is that the parents didn't take responsibility, and the child had autism. The author might have overreacted, but given the circumstances, their actions were justified. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
