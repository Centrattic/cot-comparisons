Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The person telling the story was working at a coffee shop when this family came in. The kid ended up damaging their stuff, and the parents didn't seem to care. The author approached the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The kid is autistic, which is mentioned later when the mother says so. The kid had some behavioral issues: pulling earphones, throwing them, spilling drinks on the laptop. The parents didn't intervene, and the father even laughed when told about the spill. The author confronted the manager, who then asked the family to leave. The father got angry, gave the finger, and the mother blamed the author for the kid's autism.\n\nNow, considering the parents' behavior. The father shoved the kid earlier, didn't apologize when the kid caused damage, and was dismissive. The mother didn't apologize either. The kid's actions were problematic, but the parents didn't take responsibility. The author, on the other hand, tried to handle it by talking to the manager. The manager then took action. \n\nAutism is a factor here. People on the autism spectrum can have sensory issues or communication challenges that might lead to unexpected behaviors. However, the parents have a responsibility to manage their child's actions in public, especially if they know the child has special needs. If the parents didn't take any responsibility, maybe the author was justified in involving the manager. \n\nBut wait, the author did approach the parents first before involving the manager. They asked the dad to handle the spill, but the dad ignored it. The manager's decision to ask them to leave was likely because of the parents' lack of responsibility. The author's actions might be seen as standing up for themselves, especially since the parents were inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author did curse back at the dad, which might be a point against them. But the dad was the one who gave the finger first, so maybe the author's reaction was an escalation. Still, the main issue is whether the manager's decision to remove the family was appropriate. Since the parents were negligent, the manager's action was probably justified. The kid was autistic, but the parents' behavior was the bigger issue here. So the author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their property and the environment for other customers.\n"
