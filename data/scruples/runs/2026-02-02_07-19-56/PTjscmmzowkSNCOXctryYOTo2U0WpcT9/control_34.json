Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a family with an autistic child being asked to leave a coffee shop after some incidents. \n\nFirst, the parent is upset because their child disrupted the author's work. The child pulled out the author's earphones, threw them, spilled a drink on their laptop, and the parents didn't apologize. The author then told the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The parents reacted angrily, and the author cursed back. Now, the author feels bad about the kid but is unsure if they were in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the key points. The child's actions were disruptive and caused damage. The parents didn't take responsibility. The author acted to protect their work and safety. However, the outcome was the child being kicked out, which the mom criticized, implying it's wrong to treat a disabled child this way. \n\nAutism can mean the child has behavioral challenges, but that doesn't excuse the damage done. The parents' lack of responsibility is a big factor here. The author's actions were in response to direct harm. However, cursing back might have escalated things. But the main issue is whether the author was wrong to involve the manager. Since the parents were neglectful, the author might have done the right thing. But there's a nuance here. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nPossible angles: The author could have tried to talk to the parents first, but given the parents' hostile reactions, maybe the manager was the right approach. Also, the child's disability might require understanding, but the parents' behavior is separate. The author's actions were to protect their own property and work. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with some consideration that they could have handled it differently, like de-escalating more. However, the parents were uncooperative. So the author isn't at fault.\n"
