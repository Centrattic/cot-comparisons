Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for getting a family with an autistic kid thrown out of a coffee shop. The situation starts with the kid pulling out their earphones and then spilling a drink on their laptop. The parents don't apologize, so the author goes to the manager, who asks the family to leave. The dad is rude, and the mom blames the author for the kid being autistic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The kid's behavior was disruptive, but since he's autistic, maybe that affects how his actions are perceived. The parents didn't intervene or apologize, which is a problem. The author tried to handle it by informing the manager. The manager's decision to remove the family might have been necessary due to the parents' lack of responsibility.\n\nBut was the author wrong to escalate it? They tried to ignore the kid at first, then the parents didn't help. The author had a right to protect their property. However, cursing back and doing a slow clap might have been excessive. But the main issue is whether the family should have been asked to leave. The parents' behavior seems to be part of the problem, not just the kid. The author's reaction might be justified given the parents' inaction. However, involving the manager is a reasonable step. \n\nBut some might argue that the author didn't give the parents enough of a chance to correct their behavior. Maybe they should have spoken to the parents directly first. However, the parents weren't responsive, so involving the manager makes sense. Also, the mom's comment about the kid being autistic adds a layer of insensitivity. The author's actions led to the kid's removal, which could be seen as unfair, but the parents' behavior was also inconsiderate. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be entirely at fault because they were protecting their property and the parents didn't step in. But there's a nuance here. The answer probably isn't black and white. However, since the parents were neglectful, the author's actions might be justified. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
