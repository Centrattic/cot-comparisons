Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child being thrown out of a coffee shop. The author explains that the child did several things: pulled out their earphones, spilled drinks on their laptop, and the parents didn't take responsibility.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, their belongings were damaged, and the parents didn't apologize. The child's actions were disruptive, and the parents seemed dismissive. The author reported the incident to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The author also cursed and gave the finger in return when provoked. That might be a point against them.\n\nOn the other hand, the child has autism. Parents of autistic children often face challenges, and the child might be acting out due to sensory issues or communication difficulties. The parents' reactions (smug smiles, not apologizing) could indicate poor parenting, but the author's response of involving the manager and the subsequent confrontation might have been harsh. The author's decision to have the family removed could be seen as reasonable if the situation was a threat to their property or well-being, but the way it escalated with cursing and a slow clap might not be appropriate.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's actions were proportionate. The parents not taking responsibility is a problem, but the author's response of getting them thrown out and the aggressive behavior during the argument could be excessive. Also, the child's autism should be considered in terms of their behavior, but the parents are responsible for managing their child's actions in public. However, the author's initial approach to the parents directly might have been the right step. The manager's involvement is appropriate if the situation was beyond their control. The problem is the author's own cursing and the manager's action leading to the family being removed, which might not have been the best way to handle it, especially considering the child's needs.\n\nSo, while the parents' behavior was poor, the author's reaction\u2014particularly the cursing and the manager's intervention\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate of the parents' difficult situation and the child's needs. The parents might need support rather than being ejected from the shop. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for escalating the situation and not seeking a more compassionate resolution.\n"
