Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a family with a child who has autism being asked to leave a coffee shop after some incidents.\n\nFirst, the child unplugged the author's earphones and spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't apologize, which led the author to report them to the manager. The manager then asked the family to leave, which the author supported. The key points here are the actions of the child and the parents, and the author's response.\n\nThe author mentions that the child might have autism, which can affect behavior. However, the parents' reaction is crucial here. If the child's actions were due to their condition, the parents should have been more proactive in managing their child's behavior and apologizing. The parents' smug responses and lack of accountability could be problematic.\n\nThe author's actions include confronting the parents and asking the manager to intervene. While the author was clearly upset, the question is whether their response was appropriate. The parents didn't address the incidents, so the author felt justified in seeking help. However, the child was removed from the premises, which might be seen as punishing the child for the parents' failure to manage their child's behavior. The author might have considered alternative solutions, like speaking privately with the parents first. Also, the author's cursing and the slow clap could come off as unprofessional.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' behavior\u2014especially the dad's aggression\u2014might justify the author's frustration. The manager's decision to ask them to leave is likely based on the incidents. The author did involve the manager, which is the correct step in a public place. However, the immediate removal without giving the parents a chance to apologize or correct the situation might be seen as harsh. The author's initial tolerance of the incidents without escalating earlier could also be a point against them.\n\nConsidering all factors, while the parents were at fault for not managing their child and responding inappropriately, the author's actions led to the family being thrown out. The child's autism is a factor, but the parents' responsibility is key. The author might have handled it differently to avoid public confrontation, but their decision to involve the manager was appropriate. However, the final judgment leans towards the author being in the wrong because the parents didn't directly cause the incidents, and the child's removal could be seen as punitive without proper context. So, Answer A.\n"
