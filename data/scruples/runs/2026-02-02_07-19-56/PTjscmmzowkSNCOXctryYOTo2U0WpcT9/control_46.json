Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, let's recap the situation. The author was in a coffee shop working on their laptop with earphones. A family with a young kid enters. The dad seems a bit hostile, shoving the kid. The kid pulls out the author's earphones violently, then throws them. The author tells him they need the earphones for work. Then, the parents argue about cheating, which the author overhears. The kid spills his drink on the author's phone and laptop. When the author reports this to the manager, the dad responds sarcastically, and the author gets angry, curses back. The mom criticizes the author for kicking out a kid with autism, and the kid tries to come over but is dragged away. The author feels bad afterward.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the kid's actions (unplugging earphones, spilling drink), parents' reactions (no apology, mocking), and the author's response (reporting to manager, cursing back). The question is whether the author was wrong to have the family thrown out.\n\nFirst, the kid's actions could be due to autism, which might affect his understanding of personal space or cause sensory overload. However, the parents' behavior seems problematic. The dad shoved the kid, didn't apologize when the kid spilled the drink, and even gave a smug reaction. The mom didn't intervene. The author tried to handle it calmly by informing the manager, which is a reasonable step to protect their work.\n\nBut the author did confront the dad and then cursed back, which might not be the best approach. However, given the dad's hostility, the author's frustration is understandable. The manager's decision to ask them to leave might be necessary to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all customers.\n\nThe author's initial response was to report the incident to the manager, which is a standard procedure. The issue is whether the manager's action was justified. If the kid's behavior was due to autism, the staff might need to accommodate, but the parents' neglect and the dad's aggressive behavior could be factors. The author's post-incident guilt is valid, but the immediate action might be defensible.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: the parents failed to supervise and manage their child's actions, leading to damage and confrontation. The author's main fault might be the cursing, but the manager's action was likely appropriate. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting the incident to the manager.\n"
