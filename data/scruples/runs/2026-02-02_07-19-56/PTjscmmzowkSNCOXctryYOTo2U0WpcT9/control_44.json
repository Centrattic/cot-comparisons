Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with a child who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the person dining alone was working with earphones. The family enters, and the dad shoves the kid when they sit. Then the kid unplugs the earphones violently and throws them back. The writer assumes the kid is autistic. The parents argue about cheating, and the kid spills a drink on the laptop. The dad doesn't apologize, just tells them to dry it with a napkin. The writer tells the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad reacts angrily, gives the finger, and the mom calls the writer a jerk for the kid's autism. The writer feels conflicted later.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the kid's actions were inappropriate, and the parents didn't seem to take responsibility. The writer tried to handle it by notifying the manager, which is a reasonable step. The dad's behavior was hostile, and the mom's comment was dismissive. The writer might have overreacted by cursing back, but that's a human reaction to anger. However, the writer didn't directly confront the child but dealt with the manager, which is the right approach. The parents' lack of accountability and the dad's aggressive response might mitigate the writer's wrongdoing.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer assumed the child was autistic, which might have influenced their judgment. They didn't address the child directly but instead went through the manager, which is appropriate. However, the confrontation escalated with the cursing. The writer's intention was to protect their work, which is understandable. The parents were negligent in their child's behavior, and the manager had the authority to remove them.\n\nI think the writer isn't entirely in the wrong. The main issue was the family's behavior and the parents' lack of responsibility. The writer acted within the coffee shop's policies by involving the manager. The cursing was a mistake, but the core action of reporting the incident wasn't wrong. So the answer should be B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
