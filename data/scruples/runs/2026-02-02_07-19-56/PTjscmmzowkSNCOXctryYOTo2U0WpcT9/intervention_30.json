Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were at a coffee shop, working with their earphones in. A family with a child comes in, and the kid unplugs their earphones and throws them. Then the parents don't seem to care when the kid spills something on the author's laptop. The author reports them to the manager, the family gets thrown out, and there's some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both sides. The author was trying to work, and the kid's behavior disrupted them. The parents didn't intervene when their child damaged the author's property. The author then took action by informing the manager. But did they overreact?\n\nThe kid has autism, so maybe his actions were due to sensory issues or lack of understanding social cues. The parents might not have been aware of the situation or didn't know how to handle it. However, the parents also didn't apologize or take responsibility, which is a problem. The author might have felt justified in protecting their work, but the way they reacted\u2014cursing back and clapping sarcastically\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially towards a child with autism.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' inaction allowed the kid to continue causing damage without consequences. The author's main issue was losing work due to someone else's child's actions. But throwing the kid out and the subsequent confrontation might have been more than necessary. The author might have handled it more calmly, like asking the parents to supervise better instead of escalating the situation.\n\nSo, there's a balance here. The author's actions were in self-defense and protecting their property, but the method used could have been more considerate of the child's condition. The parents also failed in their responsibility. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps could have handled it differently. However, given the circumstances, maybe the author's response was reasonable. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had the right to protect their belongings and their work.\n"
