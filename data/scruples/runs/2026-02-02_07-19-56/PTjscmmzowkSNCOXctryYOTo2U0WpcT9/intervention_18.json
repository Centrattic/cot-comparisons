Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The author is the one who reported them to the manager after a series of incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was at a coffee shop, working with earphones. The family comes in, and the kid unplugs the earphones. The author reacts politely, but the kid throws the earphones. Then the parents argue loudly about cheating. The kid spills a drink on the author's laptop and phone. When the author confronts the dad, he responds dismissively. The author then tells the manager, leading to the family being kicked out. The dad gets angry, curses, the mom defends the kid's autism, and the kid tries to apologize but is pulled away.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but I need to analyze it. Let's consider the key points. The kid's behavior might be due to autism, which can cause sensory overload or social communication challenges. The parents' response seems dismissive and possibly neglectful, not protecting the child or addressing the situation appropriately.\n\nThe author's actions: they asked for their earphones back politely, then confronted the dad when the spill happened. Reporting to the manager seems a reasonable step after the dad's nonchalant reaction. However, the dad's behavior was uncooperative, leading to an argument. The author cursed back, which might be a misstep, but the initial action of reporting was about protecting their property and safety.\n\nThe parents left the child unattended, and their response to the incident was indifferent. The kid was crying when they left, which is unfortunate. But was the author's action of getting them thrown out justified? The author's main issue was property damage and the dad's lack of responsibility. However, the kid's autism might mean the behavior wasn't intentional in a malicious way. But the parents still have a duty to manage their child's actions.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they did try to handle it calmly initially. The dad's response escalated things. The manager's decision to remove them might be standard procedure for such incidents. The author's cursing back and slow clap could be seen as overreacting, but the core action of reporting the incident isn't wrong. The parents' neglectful behavior is a factor here. The kid's needs might have been unmet, leading to the spill, but the parents didn't address it.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a response to the dad's negligence and the property damage. While the outcome was the family being kicked out, the author's intent was to resolve the issue. The parents' behavior played a significant role in the escalation. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here. The kid's autism is a mitigating factor, and maybe the author could have sought help from the manager earlier or tried to involve the parents more constructively. But given the dad's response, the author had little choice. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to weigh the options carefully.\n"
