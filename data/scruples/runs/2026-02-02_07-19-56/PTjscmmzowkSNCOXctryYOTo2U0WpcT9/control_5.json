Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that someone was in a coffee shop working on their laptop with earphones. A family with a kid who might be autistic enters. The dad seems to act a bit harsh, pushing the kid. Then the kid unplugs their earphones violently and throws them. The parents are arguing about infidelity, and the kid spills drinks on the laptop and phone. The dad laughs and tells the kid to dry it with a napkin. The author gets angry, tells the manager, and the family is asked to leave. The dad gives the finger, the author curses back, and the mom says it's wrong to kick out a kid with autism. The author is conflicted and asks if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both the author and the family. The kid's behavior might be due to autism, which can sometimes lead to sensory issues or difficulty understanding social norms. The parents left the kid alone, and the dad's initial shove might indicate a lack of appropriate parenting. The kid's actions\u2014unplugging earphones violently, spilling drinks\u2014could be due to his condition. However, the dad and mom didn't respond when the kid caused damage, instead laughing and being smug. That's pretty inconsiderate, especially if they knew or should have known their child might cause such incidents.\n\nThe author approached the manager after the spill, which is a reasonable step to address the problem. The manager then asked the family to leave, which is their responsibility to maintain a safe and respectful environment. The dad's argument and the author's cursing back might be seen as escalating the situation, but the initial action was the spill, which could have damaged the author's work. The author's anger might be justified given the potential loss of work. However, the response to the dad giving the finger by cursing back could be considered unprofessional or overly aggressive, but it might also be seen as a reaction to provocation.\n\nThe key points here are: the parents' responsibility for their child's actions, the appropriateness of the manager's intervention, and the author's reaction. The parents left the kid unsupervised, didn't intervene when the kid caused damage, and even laughed. The manager's role is to handle disturbances, so asking the family to leave is within their rights. The author's actions in reporting the incident to the manager are likely correct. The cursing back might be a personal choice but doesn't make the author entirely at fault. The mom's comment about autism suggests the parents might have a history of not managing their child's needs well. The author's initial observation and reaction to the spill were to protect their property and work, which is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong because they acted to address the damage to their belongings and followed proper channels by informing the manager. The parents were negligent, and the manager's response was appropriate. The author's anger and reaction were in response to the dad's aggression. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
