Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were in a coffee shop, working, and a family with a kid who might have autism came in. The kid pulled out their earphones, spilled drinks on their laptop and phone, and the parents didn't apologize or take responsibility. The author then told the manager, the family was asked to leave, the dad was rude, and the author even cursed back. The author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both the family and the author. The kid's actions were problematic: pulling earphones and spilling drinks. But the parents' response was also concerning\u2014they didn't apologize, laughed it off, and the dad was aggressive. The author was trying to protect their work and property, which is understandable. However, the author decided to involve the manager and have the family removed. The kid was crying, and the author felt bad later about the child's situation.\n\nAutism considerations: If the kid has autism, maybe the behavior was a result of sensory issues or lack of understanding social cues. The parents' failure to address the kid's actions could mean they didn't support their child properly. But the author's reaction might have been harsh, especially if the kid didn't understand the situation. However, the parents were also inconsiderate and aggressive, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's response: Reporting the incident to the manager is a reasonable step if the family wasn't taking responsibility. But the author did curse back, which is unprofessional and could escalate the situation. The manager's role is to handle such issues, so maybe the author should have let the manager handle the confrontation instead of getting involved directly.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned the kid was trying to apologize but the dad stopped him. This suggests the parents were not allowing the child to make amends, which is bad parenting. The author felt bad for the kid, so maybe the main issue was the parents' behavior, not the kid's.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? The family's actions were inconsiderate and possibly negligent. The author tried to handle it by reporting to the manager, which is appropriate. The cursing back and the slow clap might be unwise, but the main issue was the parents' response. The author was protecting their property and work, which is valid. The kid's autism might explain some behavior, but the parents' failure to act responsibly is a bigger problem. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but their conduct during the confrontation could be questioned. However, given the parents' behavior, maybe the author's actions were justified. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with some nuances.\n"
