Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a kid with autism who caused some issues in a coffee shop, and the author had the family thrown out. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to weigh the facts.\n\nFirst, the kid unplugged the author's earphones and then spilled a drink on their laptop and phone. The parents didn't apologize and even laughed it off. The author went to the manager, who asked the family to leave. The dad was rude, gave the finger, and the mom accused the author of targeting the autistic kid. The author felt bad later.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the kid's actions were disruptive, the parents were uncooperative, and the author escalated the situation by getting the manager involved and cursing at the dad. The question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nThe kid might have autism, so his actions could be due to sensory issues or lack of understanding. Parents might not have been supervising properly. But the parents' response was dismissive and aggressive. The author's actions included confronting the dad, involving the manager, and cursing. While the kid's behavior was problematic, the author could have handled it differently. For example, maybe the manager should have been informed earlier, or the author could have tried to de-escalate the situation instead of cursing back. However, the parents were also inconsiderate. The manager did ask the family to leave, perhaps because the kid's actions were causing damage. \n\nThe author's final action of clapping might be seen as mocking, which adds to the judgment. But considering the parents' behavior, the manager's decision might be appropriate. The author might have felt justified because the parents weren't taking responsibility. However, the author's own actions (cursing) and the public confrontation could be seen as excessive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are primarily at fault for not controlling their child and reacting poorly. The kid's autism complicates things but doesn't excuse damaging others' property. The author's response might have been a last resort after repeated offenses. But was it reasonable? If the manager's intervention was necessary, then maybe not entirely in the wrong. However, the author's personal confrontation and cursing could be seen as contributing to the conflict. So, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong for seeking help from the manager, but the personal outburst could be problematic. But given the parents' behavior, maybe it's justified. So, leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B).\n"
