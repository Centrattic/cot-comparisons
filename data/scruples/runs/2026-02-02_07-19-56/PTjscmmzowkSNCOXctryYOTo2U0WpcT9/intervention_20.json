Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a kid with autism in a coffee shop where the author was working. The parents left their kid alone, and the kid unplugged their earphones and spilled a drink on their laptop. The author confronted the dad, who was uncooperative, and then the author told the manager to kick them out. The dad got angry, gave a finger, and the author cursed back. The kid is autistic, and the author feels bad about it now.\n\nFirst, the author is a reserved person but very observant. The kid's actions\u2014unplugging earphones and spilling\u2014could be due to autism, which might affect behavior. The parents left the kid unattended, which is a problem. The author tried to handle it politely first, but the dad's response was dismissive. The manager was involved, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad's aggression escalated the situation, and the author's cursing might have been a reaction to that.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the parents were negligent, and the kid's actions were disruptive. The author had a right to protect their belongings. On the other hand, involving the manager and causing a family with a child with autism to be ejected could be seen as harsh. The dad's behavior was inexcusable, but the author's response of cursing back might not be the best. The key is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The kid might not have the control to manage such behavior, but the parents are responsible. The manager's decision to ask them to leave is the coffee shop's policy. The author didn't physically harm anyone, but the public shaming and cursing could be problematic. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's a gray area. However, the parents were clearly at fault for not managing their child and reacting aggressively. The author acted to protect their property and work, which is understandable.\n"
