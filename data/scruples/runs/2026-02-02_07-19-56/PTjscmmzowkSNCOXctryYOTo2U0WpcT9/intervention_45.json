Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic child thrown out of a coffee shop. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was working in a coffee shop when a family entered. The parents left their autistic child unattended, who then damaged the author's equipment. The parents didn't apologize, so the author reported them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The parents reacted angrily, and the author cursed back.\n\nThe key points here are the actions of the parents versus the author. The parents left their child unattended, which is a red flag, especially for a child who might have sensory issues or not understand social boundaries. The child's actions of unplugging earphones and spilling drinks could be due to their condition, not malice.\n\nThe author did try to warn the child politely and was ignored. When the parents didn't take responsibility, the author reported them to the manager. That part seems reasonable because the parents weren't supervising their child, leading to damage. However, when the author cursed back at the dad, that's where things escalated. Also, the mom's comment about the child's autism makes the author's retaliation questionable, as it could be seen as targeting the child's condition.\n\nBut then, the manager was the one who asked the family to leave, so the author's role was to report the issue. The problem is how the situation was handled afterward\u2014cursing and the slow clap might have been unprofessional. However, the parents' behavior (the dad giving the finger) could have provoked a reaction.\n\nConsidering the parents' negligence in supervising their child and their dismissive attitude, the author's action of reporting them might be justified. The issue is the author's own reaction\u2014cursing back and the slow clap could be seen as aggressive, especially toward a child with autism. The author feels bad afterward, indicating some awareness of the potential wrongness.\n\nBut the manager made the decision to remove the family, so the author isn't directly responsible for that. The main question is whether the author overreacted. Since the parents didn't take responsibility and the child was autistic, the author had a right to be concerned about their own property and safety. However, the author's response might have been too harsh. Especially since the child was autistic, the parents might need more understanding, but they clearly weren't providing supervision.\n\nSo, there's a balance between accountability and compassion. The author's immediate actions (reporting the incident) were probably okay. The cursing and slow clap were not. But the core issue is the parents' failure to supervise. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for taking the action they did, given the parents' negligence. The author's own reaction is problematic but the main issue is the parents' behavior.\n"
