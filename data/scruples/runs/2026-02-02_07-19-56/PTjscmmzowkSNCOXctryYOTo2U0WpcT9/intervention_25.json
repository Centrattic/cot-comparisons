Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is at a coffee shop, working on their laptop with earphones. A family enters, and the parents leave their kid unattended. The kid pulls out the author's earphones, then spills a drink on the laptop and phone. The parents don't apologize and even seem smug. The author reports this to the manager, leading the family to be asked to leave. The dad gets angry, gives the finger, and the mom accuses the author of targeting a kid with autism. The author curses back and claps sarcastically. Now the author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the key points. The kid's actions were definitely disruptive and damaging. The parents didn't intervene when the kid pulled the earphones or spilled the drink. Instead, they reacted with smugness and the dad even laughed. The author tried to handle it calmly at first, asking the dad politely. But when the dad refused to take responsibility, the author escalated by going to the manager. The manager then asked the family to leave. \n\nBut wait, the kid is autistic. The author realized this after the mom mentioned it. Even so, the parents' behavior was problematic. They didn't supervise their child properly, didn't apologize for the damage, and were hostile. The author's actions led to the family being thrown out, which might be seen as harsh, especially considering the child's needs. However, the parents' lack of responsibility and the dad's aggression might justify the author's actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The parents were clearly not taking responsibility, and the child's actions were a result of their neglect. The author tried to address it first by talking to the dad, which is reasonable. When that failed, involving the manager was a step to protect their property. However, the author cursed back and clapped sarcastically. That part might be seen as unprofessional or overly aggressive. But given the dad's hostile reaction, maybe it's a justified response to provocation.\n\nThe main issue is that the parents were at fault for not managing their child, not the child's autism itself. The author's actions were a response to the parents' negligence and hostility. So, while the author could have handled it differently (maybe staying calm even when the dad was rude), the parents were the primary wrongdoers. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. \n\nBut there's another angle: the child has autism, and maybe the parents were already under stress. However, the parents still have a responsibility to supervise their child. The author's actions were in response to their neglect and the damage caused. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance because of the child's condition. However, the parents' behavior was the main issue, not the child's autism. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
