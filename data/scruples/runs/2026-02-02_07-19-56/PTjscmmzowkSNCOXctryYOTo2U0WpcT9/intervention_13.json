Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with a child who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The person writing the story (the author) is a customer who had their earphones pulled and laptop spilled on by the child. They approached the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave, and some conflict ensued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The child is described as possibly autistic, and the parents might not have been managing the situation well. The child pulled the author's earphones and spilled a drink on their laptop. The author then confronted the father, who responded dismissively. The manager was called, leading to the family's removal. The author feels conflicted because the child might have autism, but the parents' behavior also seems problematic.\n\nThe key points here are: the child's age and possible autism, the parents' response to the incident, and the author's decision to involve the manager. The author is questioning if they were wrong to have the family removed. \n\nOn one hand, the parents left the child unattended, which could be a red flag. The father's dismissive attitude (\"dry it with a napkin\") and the mother's silence suggest poor parenting. On the other hand, the author's reaction included cursing back and a slow clap, which might be seen as aggressive. The child's autism is a factor here; autistic children might not understand social norms and may act out, but the parents are responsible for managing their child's behavior in public.\n\nThe author's initial reaction to the child's actions (smiling, politely speaking) seems reasonable. However, the escalation when the father didn't take responsibility is where things got heated. The manager was involved, which is the proper course of action if a customer feels their property is being damaged. The problem here is whether the author overstepped by causing the family to be thrown out, especially knowing the child might have autism. \n\nThere's a balance between protecting one's property and showing empathy. The parents' behavior might be worse, but the author's public confrontation and cursing could be seen as unprofessional. However, given the parents' lack of accountability, the author's actions might be justified in seeking resolution through the manager. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are more at fault for not controlling their child and not taking accountability. The author acted within their rights to protect their belongings. However, the way the situation was handled, especially the verbal confrontation, might have been unhelpful. But the core issue is the parents' negligence. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They had a legitimate issue with their property being damaged and took steps through the proper channel. The parents' behavior was worse, and the child's autism doesn't excuse the parents from responsibility. However, the author's response could have been more measured to avoid public conflict, but the main action (reporting to the manager) was appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
