Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the A-hole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child being asked to leave a coffee shop after some incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author was at the coffee shop working, and the family came in. The child had some interactions that caused issues. The key points are: the child pulled the author's earphones, spilled drinks on the laptop, and the parents didn't apologize. The author then reported the incident to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, the mom called the author a jerk, and the child was crying.\n\nNow, thinking about the author's actions. They did try to resolve the situation peacefully at first, asking the dad politely. When that didn't work, they went to the manager. The manager's job is to handle such situations, so involving them might be appropriate. However, there's a question about whether the author overstepped by causing a family to be removed, especially considering the child's autism. The parents' behavior was also problematic\u2014they didn't take responsibility and were dismissive. \n\nBut the author's response included cursing back and a slow clap, which could be seen as escalating the situation. The parents' actions were inexcusable, but the child might not have been in control of their actions. The manager's decision to ask them to leave might have been necessary for the safety and comfort of other customers. However, the author's own reaction in cursing might reflect poorly on them. \n\nAlso, the mom's comment about the child having autism and calling the author a jerk adds another layer. The author might have misjudged the situation initially, assuming the child was autistic, which the mom confirmed later. But the main issue is whether the author was justified in reporting the family. The parents' behavior certainly contributed to the problem. The author was protecting their property and trying to work in a public space without disturbance. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a balance between the parents' negligence and the author's response. The parents are clearly at fault for not supervising the child and being disrespectful. The author acted to protect their belongings and their right to work in peace. However, the cursing and slow clap might be seen as unprofessional. But the main action of reporting the incident to the manager was probably justified. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The parents were the main issue, but the author's frustration led to some inappropriate reactions. However, the core action of involving the manager was reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
