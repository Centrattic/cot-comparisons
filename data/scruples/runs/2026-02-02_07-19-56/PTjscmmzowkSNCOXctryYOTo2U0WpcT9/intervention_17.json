Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person at a coffee shop dealing with a family, including a child with autism, who disrupts their work. The key points are the child's actions, the parents' responses, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the child unplugs the author's earphones violently, then spills a drink on their laptop and phone. The parents don't address this, even when confronted. The author reports them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The author gets angry, curses back, and claps sarcastically. The parents argue, and the mother criticizes the author for targeting the child with autism.\n\nThe author claims to be reserved and observant. The parents' behavior is questionable\u2014they don't discipline the child or apologize. The child's actions, especially if he's on the spectrum, might be beyond his control. The author's response was to involve the manager and confront the parents. The key issue here is whether the author overstepped by having the family removed, especially after the mother's comment about the child's autism.\n\nAutism can affect behavior, and the child might not understand right from wrong. The parents' lack of response suggests possible neglect. However, the author's public confrontation and the manager's action might have been harsh, potentially embarrassing the family. The author's anger and cursing back could be seen as inappropriate, even if the parents were at fault. The mother's comment implies the child has a disability, which might mean the author should have been more understanding. But the parents' inaction also contributed. The manager's decision to ask them to leave might be justified due to the damage caused. However, the author's role in escalating the situation by cursing and clapping sarcastically could be problematic. So, while the parents may be wrong, the author's actions might not be entirely without fault. The answer hinges on whether the author's response was proportional and respectful, especially considering the child's needs. Given that, the author might be in the wrong for the public confrontation and cursing, even if the parents were negligent.\n"
