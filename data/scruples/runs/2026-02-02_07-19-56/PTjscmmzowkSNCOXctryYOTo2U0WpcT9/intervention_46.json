Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coffee shop incident where the author had a family with an autistic child thrown out. The key points here are the actions of the family and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the kid unplugged the author's earphones and then spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents, instead of taking responsibility, gave smug reactions. The author reported the incident to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, and the author cursed back. The mom criticized the removal of the autistic child. The author later felt bad about it.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author might be in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the parents didn't act responsibly, ignoring the child's actions and even mocking the situation. The author had a right to report the damage to their property. On the other hand, the author confronted the dad directly, which might have escalated the situation, and cursing back could be seen as unprofessional. Also, the kid has autism, which might mean the parents were dealing with challenges, and the author's public shaming could have been harsh. However, the parents' behavior was inexcusable. The manager handled the ejection, so the author might not be directly at fault for that. The main issue is whether the author overreacted. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the parents' neglect. Since the parents didn't take responsibility, the author's actions might be justified. But if the author had the kid removed without ensuring the parents were informed or involved, that could be a problem. However, the manager did the ejection, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The key points are the parents' negligence and the author's right to protect their property. So, leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
