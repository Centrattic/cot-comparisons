Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. They provided a detailed scenario from a Reddit-style question.\n\nFirst, the author is at a coffee shop, working on their laptop with earphones. A family enters, and the kid with autism unplugs their earphones. The kid then throws them. The parents argue loudly about cheating, the kid spills a drink on the laptop, and the father dismissively tells the author to dry it. The author reports the family to the manager, leading to them being thrown out. The dad gives a finger, and the author curses back. The mom criticizes the action because the kid has autism, and the author feels guilty later.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nThe key points here are the actions of the family versus the author's response. The kid has autism, which might explain some behaviors. The parents' reactions\u2014arguing loudly, not addressing the kid's actions, and being dismissive\u2014could indicate poor parenting. The author was provoked multiple times: having their earphones pulled, the kid throwing them, the spill, and the parents' indifference. The author approached the manager, which is a reasonable step when someone else's actions are damaging their property. The manager then asked the family to leave, which is within their right as a business owner.\n\nHowever, the author's final actions, like cursing back and giving a slow clap, might be seen as escalations. Also, the mother's comment about the kid having autism adds complexity. The author might not have known about the autism before, but once informed, they felt guilt. The question is whether the author overreacted given the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, the parents failed to manage their child and were disrespectful. The author's actions were to protect their work and seek resolution. On the other hand, the author escalated with cursing, which isn't professional. However, the parents were the initial aggressors. The manager's decision to remove the family was appropriate. So, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their response was proportionate. The author didn't attack the family physically but used the manager to have them leave, which is acceptable. The cursing was a reaction to being insulted, which could be seen as justified in some contexts but not in others.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's main action (reporting the incident) is not wrong. The verbal retaliation might be a minor issue, but the initial provocation by the family was significant. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
