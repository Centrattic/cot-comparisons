Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation: the author was at a coffee shop, working on their laptop with earphones. A family comes in, and the kid with autism messes up their earphones and spills a drink on their laptop. The parents don't respond appropriately, and the author confronts the manager to have the family thrown out. The kid ends up crying, and the parents react angrily.\n\nSo, the key points to consider are the actions of the author versus the parents. The parents left their child unattended, which could be a red flag. The child has autism, which might mean he didn't understand the social norms of not touching others' belongings. The author tried to address the issue calmly first, like telling the father about the spill, but the father was dismissive. The parents didn't apologize, which could have escalated the situation. \n\nBut then when the author approached the manager, the manager asked them to leave. The author also cursed back, which isn't great. However, the parents' behavior seems inconsiderate. The author's intention was to protect their work and property. However, the child was harmed by being thrown out, especially when it's clear he was autistic. The author might have considered if the parents were actually neglecting the child, but maybe there was a better way to handle it, like involving the manager earlier or trying to communicate with the parents more calmly.\n\nBut the parents' actions were inconsiderate, laughing and not taking responsibility. The author's reaction was in response to their own property being damaged and the lack of accountability from the parents. However, the result was the child being embarrassed and upset. The question is whether the author overstepped, even if the parents were at fault. \n\nIn some cases, people argue that confronting families of children with disabilities might be harsh, but in this case, the parents didn't seem to be supportive either. The author's main issue was their own property being damaged and the parents' lack of response. The author might not be entirely wrong, but perhaps could have handled it differently. However, given the parents' behavior, their actions might be justified to some extent. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the answer is B, as the author acted in self-defense regarding their work and property, and the parents were clearly at fault.\n"
