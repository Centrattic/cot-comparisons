Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The author was at the coffee shop working, and the kid did some stuff like yanking the earphones and spilling drinks on the laptop. The parents didn't apologize, and the author complained to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both the author and the family. The kid has autism, which might mean he has different behaviors. The parents left the kid unattended, which could be part of the problem. The kid's actions were disruptive: taking the earphones and spilling drinks. The author tried to handle it politely but then went to the manager. The manager's decision to ask them to leave might be based on the kid's behavior and the parents' response.\n\nBut wait, the parents' reaction is also important. The dad laughed and told the author to dry the spill with a napkin. The mom didn't apologize. The author got angry and cursed back, which is probably not the best response. The kid ended up crying, and the dad dragged him away.\n\nNow, the key points: The author reported the incident to the manager, which is a reasonable step if they felt their property was at risk. However, the manager's responsibility is to maintain the environment for all customers. If the kid's behavior was disruptive and the parents weren't managing it, the manager had the right to intervene. The author's initial response was to try to communicate with the parents, which is okay. But cursing back at the dad escalates the situation. Also, getting the family kicked out over a child's behavior, especially with autism, might be seen as harsh if the parents were already struggling. The author felt bad afterward, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nBut the parents' behavior is also problematic. They didn't take responsibility, and their son's actions caused damage. The manager's role is to handle such situations, so the author's involvement was part of the process. However, the author's reaction (cursing) is not appropriate, and the manager should have handled it without the author's escalation. Also, the kid's autism might mean that the parents need more support, but that doesn't excuse the parents' lack of responsibility for their child's actions.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their property and trying to work with the staff. But their response was aggressive. The parents were negligent. The manager's decision might have been necessary. The question is whether the author overstepped. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the manager took action, but the way the author reacted (cursing) was bad. However, the main issue is the parents' behavior and the manager's role. The author's primary action was reporting the incident, which is acceptable. The wrong is more on the parents and the manager's judgment, not necessarily the author. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the author's personal response was unprofessional. But according to the question, the main point is whether the author is in the wrong for the situation. The manager's decision is the key, and the author reported the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
