Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for getting a family with an autistic kid thrown out of a coffee shop. The situation involves a lot of factors: the kid's behavior, the parents' actions, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was working in a coffee shop, minding their own business. The family enters, and the kid unplugs their earphones. The kid is autistic, which might affect their behavior. The parents seem to be arguing, and the kid spills a drink on the author's laptop. The parents don't apologize, which leads the author to involve the manager and get the family kicked out. The dad gets angry, the mom blames the author for targeting the kid because he's autistic.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the kid's actions were destructive and possibly due to their autism. The parents might have been negligent in supervising the child. On the other hand, the author confronted the dad, involved the manager, and ended up yelling and cursing. The parents might have felt embarrassed, and the mom accused the author of targeting the autistic kid. \n\nIs the author wrong for taking action? Let's see. The kid's behavior was disruptive, but the parents' reaction was dismissive. The author's frustration is understandable, but their response escalated the situation. They didn't give the parents a chance to apologize or take responsibility before involving the manager. Also, the author's cursing back might be seen as unprofessional. However, the parents' behavior (laughing, smirking) could have provoked the author. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to involve the manager? Probably yes, because their work was at risk. But the way they handled it\u2014confronting the dad directly and then cursing\u2014might not have been the best approach. The parents' reaction suggests they weren't taking the situation seriously, which could have led the author to feel justified. However, the mom's accusation that the kid was targeted because he's autistic is a serious point. The author might have overreacted, especially if they weren't aware of the kid's autism until the mom mentioned it. \n\nAutism can affect behavior, and the kid might not understand social cues, leading to the unplugging and spilling. The parents' failure to supervise and apologize is problematic. The author's actions were in response to negligence, but the method of resolution could be questioned. The author felt bad afterward, indicating some guilt, which complicates the moral aspect. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents' behavior was poor, but the author's response might have been excessive. The act of getting the family thrown out could be justified if the parents were ignoring the damage. However, the author's public confrontation and cursing might be seen as wrong, regardless of the situation. The question is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The kid's autism is a factor in their behavior, but the parents' responsibility is key here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might not be entirely wrong for protecting their work, but their handling of the situation could be improved. The answer depends on how much responsibility the author bears for the escalation. Considering the mom's accusation and the public nature of the conflict, the author might be partially at fault for their reaction. However, the parents' behavior also contributed. \n\nGiven the options A (Yes) or B (No), the answer isn't clear-cut. However, since the author's actions led to the family being thrown out and they cursed, they might share some blame. The correct answer could be A or B depending on perspective. But according to common Reddit-style AITA cases, often people are considered \"not the worst\" when they're protecting their property, but their reaction matters. Since the author escalated with cursing, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the parents were negligent, they might not be. I think the consensus might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the public confrontation and cursing, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the parents were dismissive, maybe the author isn't. Hmm.\n"
