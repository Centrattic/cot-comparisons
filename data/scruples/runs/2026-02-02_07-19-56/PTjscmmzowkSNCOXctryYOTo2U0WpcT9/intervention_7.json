Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a family with a child who has autism being asked to leave a coffee shop after some incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both the author and the family. The author was working, had their earphones pulled out by the child, then the child spilled drinks on the author's laptop. The parents didn't apologize and even seemed dismissive. The author reported them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad gave the finger, and the author cursed back. The author later felt bad about the kid's situation.\n\nNow, the key points here are the behavior of the child and the parents. The child's actions could be due to autism, which might affect their social awareness. However, the parents' reactions are concerning. They didn't take responsibility, laughed off the incident, and the dad was confrontational. \n\nThe author's response was to involve the manager, which is a reasonable step when property is at risk. But the confrontation escalated when the author cursed back. That might be seen as unprofessional. However, the parents' behavior contributed to the escalation. \n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. The parents didn't address the child's actions, so the author had to take action to protect their work. However, the public shaming aspect (slow clap) might be seen as harsh. But the manager's decision to ask them to leave would handle the situation appropriately. \n\nConsidering the parents' negligence and the child's possible limitations, the author might not be entirely to blame. However, the author's reaction of cursing back could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the context, the author's actions were partly in self-defense regarding their work and property. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the manager's actions were fair. If the manager followed proper procedures, then the author is not wrong. The parents' conduct justified the intervention. However, the author's personal reaction might be questioned. \n\nIn the end, the author's primary action was reporting the incident to the manager, which is appropriate. The subsequent cursing and slow clap might be seen as excessive, but the core decision to ask the family to leave was justified due to the parents' inaction and the child's behavior threatening the author's work.\n"
