Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a family of a kid with autism thrown out of a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was working at a coffee shop when a family came in. The kid, who is autistic, had some incidents like pulling out the author's earphones and spilling a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't seem to respond appropriately, leading the author to ask the manager to remove the family. The dad even argued and gave the finger, and the author cursed back. Now the author is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the actions taken by both the family and the author. The kid's behavior might be influenced by autism, which can cause sensory overload or difficulty with social interactions. However, the parents' response is crucial here. They didn't address the kid's actions, which could be due to a lack of understanding about autism or intentional neglect. The kid spilling the drink on the laptop is a significant issue, as it could cause damage and data loss. \n\nThe author approached the manager, which is a reasonable step to resolve the situation. The manager's role is to handle such incidents. The family's reaction\u2014arguing, not apologizing, and the dad's aggressive behavior\u2014might have escalated the situation. The author's decision to curse back could be seen as responding in kind, but that's debatable.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The author's intent was to protect their property and work. However, involving the manager is a valid action. The parents' behavior might have contributed to the escalation. The kid's autism is a factor, but the parents are responsible for managing their child's behavior. \n\nOn one hand, the author acted to protect their belongings, which is reasonable. On the other hand, the parents' lack of response and the dad's aggression might have made the situation worse. The author's public shaming with the slow clap could be seen as harsh, but it's a reaction to the dad's behavior.\n\nConsidering all factors, the main responsibility lies with the parents for not managing their child's actions and responding appropriately. The author's actions were a response to provocation and a breach of reasonable behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
