Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop by the author. The author was working in the coffee shop, and the kid did some things like unplugging their earphones and spilling a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't seem to apologize, and the author went to the manager to have them leave. Now the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author says they are reserved and try to mind their own business but are observant. The kid had autism, which the author suspected, and the parents might have been arguing. The kid's actions were disruptive, but the parents didn't intervene. The author felt their work was at risk and asked the manager to remove them. The parents reacted angrily, and the author cursed back. The kid was crying, and the author felt bad about it afterward.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid has a disability. Autism can lead to different behaviors that might not be intentional. The parents might not have been aware of the situation or how to handle it. The author's reaction might have been a bit harsh, especially considering the child's needs. The manager's role is to handle such situations, so maybe the author should have let the manager handle it without getting involved. Also, cursing back might not have been the best response, even if angry.\n\nBut the author did approach the manager, which is the correct step. The parents didn't take responsibility, and the child's actions were causing harm. The author had a right to protect their property and work. However, the public shaming by getting the family thrown out could be seen as overreacting, especially when the child was already upset. The author's slow clap and cursing might have added to the humiliation.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents are responsible for their children's actions. The author didn't confront the family directly first but went to the manager, which is a good step. However, the manager's decision to remove them might have been influenced by the author's complaint. The key points are whether the child's behavior was due to his disability and if the parents were adequately handling the situation. The author's frustration is understandable, but the outcome might have been more harmful to the child's well-being.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were proportionate. The manager's role is to assess the situation, and the author might have overstepped by escalating it to the point of removal. The parents might have needed support rather than being ejected. Also, the author's own reaction (cursing) is unprofessional. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling it more calmly and considering the child's needs. But they did report the incident to management, which is the right thing. It's a tricky balance between self-defense and being empathetic to the child's situation. So I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they contributed to a harsh outcome that affected a child with autism, possibly without fully understanding the parents' challenges.\n"
