Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with a child who has autism being asked to leave a coffee shop. The author was working and their earphones were pulled out, then their phone and laptop were spilled on. The parents didn't apologize, and the author called the manager, leading to the family being ejected. The parents reacted angrily, and the author cursed back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The child's behavior was disruptive\u2014yanking earphones and spilling drinks. The parents didn't apologize, which is concerning, especially with a child who might have special needs. The author tried to handle it calmly but escalated to involving the manager. Was it right to call the manager? The parents were uncooperative, so maybe the author had no choice. However, the child might have autism, which the author suspected but didn't know for sure. The mom confirmed it later. The author's reaction included cursing and a slow clap, which might be seen as harsh. \n\nBut the parents' behavior (arguing loudly, not addressing the mess, mocking the author) is also problematic. The author was trying to protect their work. The manager's role is to handle such situations, so involving her might be appropriate. The key issue is whether the author overreacted. The parents didn't take responsibility, so the author's actions could be justified as self-defense. However, the child's autism might mean the parents were struggling, and the author's response might have been too severe. The answer depends on balancing the parents' and author's actions. Maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's nuance. The answer is B, No, because the parents didn't cooperate, and the author acted to protect their belongings.\n"
