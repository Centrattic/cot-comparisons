Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the kid unplugs the author's earphones and spills a drink on their laptop. The parents don't apologize and seem dismissive. The author then reports them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad gets angry, curses back, and the mom accuses the author of targeting a child with autism. The author feels conflicted afterward.\n\nNow, considering the facts. The kid's actions were disruptive, and the parents didn't take responsibility. The author was working and had property damaged. Reporting the incident to the manager is a reasonable step. However, the author did curse back and gave a slow clap, which might be seen as unprofessional or uncivil. Also, the mom's comment about autism suggests the child's condition wasn't the reason for the conflict, but the parents' behavior was an issue.\n\nBut wait, was the author justified in involving the manager? Yes, because the kid's actions caused damage. But did the author overreact by cursing? Maybe. However, the parents were also aggressive. The key is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The parents were at fault for not overseeing their child and reacting rudely. The author's response to report the damage is valid. The conflict escalated due to the parents' behavior. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B, but need to check if the author overstepped. The slow clap and cursing could be seen as unkind, but the main issue was the parents' negligence. So the author isn't the main wrongdoer here.\n"
