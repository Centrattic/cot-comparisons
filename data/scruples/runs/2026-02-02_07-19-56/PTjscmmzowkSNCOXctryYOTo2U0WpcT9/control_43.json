Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The author is the one who reported them to the manager.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was working in a coffee shop when a family entered. The kid, who is autistic, unplugged their earphones and spilled a drink on their laptop and phone. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility, and the dad even laughed off the spill. The author then confronted the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad became aggressive, and the author cursed back. The mom accused the author of punishing a kid with autism.\n\nNow, the key points here. The kid has autism. The parents might not have been handling the situation well. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for involving the manager and causing the family to be thrown out. \n\nOn one hand, the parents didn't seem to take responsibility for their child's actions or the damage caused. The dad shoved the kid earlier, which could indicate poor parenting. The kid's actions were disruptive, but being autistic, he might not understand the consequences. The parents' reaction (smiling, arguing) suggests they weren't helping the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe approached the parents first calmly to address the spill without involving the manager immediately. Also, cursing back at the dad might have escalated things. However, the parents were dismissive, so the author felt justified in seeking help from the manager. The manager's role is to handle such disturbances, so the author might not be wrong for involving them.\n\nThe kid was crying after being asked to leave. The author felt bad about it later. But the parents' behavior was problematic. The author's actions might have been necessary to protect their work and ensure a safe environment. But the public shaming (slow clap) might have been unkind.\n\nAutism considerations: The kid might not have known better. The parents should be responsible for managing their child's behavior. However, the author's reaction could be seen as harsh if the kid couldn't control his actions. But the parents' lack of intervention was also a problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents failed to supervise and manage their child. The author tried to handle it politely but when ignored, escalated appropriately. The manager's decision to ask them out was probably based on the situation. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The parents are more at fault here. The author's actions were a reaction to the parents' negligence. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
