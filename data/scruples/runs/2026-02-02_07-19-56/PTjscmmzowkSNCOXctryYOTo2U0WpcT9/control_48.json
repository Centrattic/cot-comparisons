Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. They were at a coffee shop, their earphones were pulled out by a kid, the kid spilled a drink on their laptop, and then when they reported it to the manager, the family was asked to leave. The author is now wondering if they were at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The kid might have autism, which can affect behavior. The parents didn't seem to be handling the situation well. The author tried to work but was repeatedly disturbed. The kid's actions were aggressive, and the parents didn't intervene, even when the kid spilled the drink. The author approached the manager, leading to the family being asked out. The dad was hostile, and the mom accused the author of targeting the kid because he's autistic. The author even says they felt bad for the kid later.\n\nSo, the key points are: the kid's behavior was disruptive and possibly due to autism, the parents were neglectful, the author tried to handle it politely at first, but when it escalated, they acted. Now, is the author wrong?\n\nThe parents are responsible for their child's actions. If the kid has autism, it's possible that the parents need more support, but in this case, they didn't act when the kid caused damage. The author's actions were to protect their property and work. However, the way they handled it\u2014cursing back and making the kid cry\u2014might be seen as harsh. But the parents were in the wrong for not controlling their child. The author might have overreacted in the heat of the moment, especially since the kid was crying. But considering the parents' neglect, the author's actions could be justified. The main issue is whether the author was responsible for the kid's behavior. Since the parents are responsible, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the way the situation was resolved could be seen as harsh. But given the parents' behavior, maybe the manager's decision was appropriate. The author might feel guilty, but legally and morally, they were protecting their property. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
