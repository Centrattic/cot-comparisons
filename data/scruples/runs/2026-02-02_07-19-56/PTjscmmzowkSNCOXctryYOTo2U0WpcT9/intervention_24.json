Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic kid thrown out of a coffee shop. The author was working in a coffee shop when a family entered. The kid pulled out their earphones and spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't apologize, so the author reported them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, and the kid was crying.\n\nFirst, the kid's actions: he pulled the earphones and spilled a drink. But the kid is autistic, so maybe he didn't understand the social cues. The parents' reaction is key here. They didn't apologize, laughed, and the dad shoved the kid earlier. The author tried to handle it calmly, but the parents were dismissive. \n\nThe author approached the manager, which is a reasonable step when someone else's property is being damaged. The manager's role is to handle such situations. The dad's behavior was aggressive, so the manager's decision to ask them to leave was appropriate. The author's response to the dad cursing back might be a point against them, but given the provocation, it's understandable. \n\nThe mom's comment about the kid being autistic and calling the author a jerk adds context. However, the parents' responsibility to manage their child's behavior is crucial. The author didn't directly harm the kid but acted based on the parents' inaction. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because they tried to resolve the issue through proper channels. The parents' behavior was worse. However, there's a nuance in how the author handled the confrontation. But overall, the main issue is the parents' lack of accountability, not the author's action to protect their work. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
