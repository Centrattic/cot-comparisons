Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic kid thrown out of a coffee shop. The story is from the Reddit \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, which is where people share their dilemmas and others vote on whether they're the asshole or not.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author was at a coffee shop, working on a laptop with earphones. A family entered, and the kid, who is autistic, pulled out the author's earphones, spilled a drink on the laptop, and the parents didn't respond appropriately. The author told the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad got angry, the kid was upset. The author felt bad later about the kid but still wonders if they did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider the key elements here. The kid's actions: pulling the earphones and spilling the drink. The parents' response: not apologizing, even being dismissive. The author's response: reporting to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave, then getting angry and cursing back. The kid is autistic, which might affect his behavior.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nLet me think. The parents' behavior is a big part here. They didn't apologize when their child caused damage. The kid might have autism, but it's the parents' responsibility to manage their child's actions in public. The author tried to handle it calmly, asked the dad politely, but got ignored. Then the manager was called. The parents' argument about cheating might have been a distraction, but the main issue is their lack of responsibility towards the kid's actions. \n\nHowever, the author did get angry and cursed back. That part could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. But the parents were being rude. The manager's role is to handle such situations, so the author's action in involving the manager might be justified. The kid was being harmed by the parents' neglect, so removing the family could protect the kid from his parents' poor handling. \n\nBut the author might have overreacted in the way they handled it, especially cursing back. However, in the context of the parents' dismissive attitude, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The parents didn't take responsibility, so the manager's intervention was appropriate. The kid's autism isn't an excuse for the parents' failure to manage him. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they took appropriate action when the parents failed to address the damage caused by their child. The parents' behavior was worse. The author's anger is understandable given the situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
