Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was in a coffee shop and a family with a kid who has autism came in. The kid did some things like unplugging the author's earphones and spilling a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't respond well and got into an argument, and the author told the manager to have them thrown out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the actions taken by the author. The kid did damage the author's property, which is a valid concern. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility, even after the laptop was spilled on. The author approached the manager, who then asked the family to leave. The author then cursed back at the dad when he gave the finger, which might be problematic. Also, the author mentions that the kid was autistic, and the mom called them a jerk for having the kid kicked out. The author felt bad about the kid but still had them removed.\n\nOn one hand, the author was protecting their property and trying to get the staff to handle the situation. The parents weren't helping, so maybe the manager's decision was appropriate. On the other hand, the author directly cursed back at the dad, which is aggressive. Also, maybe the manager could have handled it without the author's input. But the kid did cause damage, so the author was within their rights to report it. The parents not taking responsibility might have escalated things. \n\nThe key points here are: the kid's actions, the parents' inaction, the author's response in involving management, and the author's own cursing. The parents might be at fault for not managing their child, but the author did take the step to contact the manager, which is the right course of action. The cursing back is probably where the author went wrong, as it's unprofessional and could have been avoided. However, the main action of reporting the incident to the manager might not be wrong. The author's follow-up actions (clapping, cursing) are more questionable. But the initial act of having them thrown out might be justified because of the damage caused, especially if the parents weren't cooperative.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? The initial action of involving management might be okay, but the author's personal reactions (cursing back, clapping) are problematic. However, the main question is about having the family thrown out. If the manager decided to remove them, maybe it's not the author's responsibility. The parents' behavior also contributed. The kid's autism is a factor, but the parents' negligence in managing the child's actions is a bigger issue. The author might have overreacted in the way they handled it, but the core issue is the parents' lack of responsibility. So, depending on perspective, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting the damage, but their handling of the confrontation could be seen as wrong. The answer might be A or B. Hmm. I think the key is whether the manager acted appropriately. If the manager's decision was correct, then the author isn't wrong. But if the author took over the situation, maybe they are. Also, the author's cursing and clapping are negative points. So maybe A (the author is in the wrong) because they escalated beyond reporting to the manager. Alternatively, if the manager did the right thing, then the author isn't wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the main issue was the parents' failure to handle their child, and the author reported the damage. The author's own reactions are bad, but the main action of having them removed might be justified. So the answer could be B.\n"
