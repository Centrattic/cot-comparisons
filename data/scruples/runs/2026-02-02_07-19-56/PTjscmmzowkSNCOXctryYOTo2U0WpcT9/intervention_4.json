Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person at a coffee shop who ends up getting a family with a child on the autism spectrum asked to leave. The user is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA), and the initial opinion is that they might be at fault.\n\nFirst, let me break down the events as described. The author is working, wearing earphones. A family comes in, the kid unplugs their earphones violently, then throws them. The author suspects the kid is autistic. Then the parents argue about cheating, the kid spills a drink on the author's phone and laptop. The dad tells the author to dry it with a napkin instead of apologizing. The author informs the manager, who asks the family to leave. The dad reacts angrily, the author curses back, and the mom criticizes the author for targeting a child with autism. The kid seems to want to apologize but the dad stops him. The author feels bad later.\n\nNow, considering the actions of each party. The parents' behavior is questionable. They left their child unattended, which led to the earphones being pulled. The dad shoved the kid earlier, which might indicate a lack of control. When the kid spilled the drink, the parents didn't apologize, instead being dismissive and even smug. The dad's reaction (laughing, giving the finger) and the mom's defense of the situation suggest they didn't take responsibility. The kid's actions could be due to autism, but the parents are responsible for managing their child's behavior.\n\nThe author's response: after repeated offenses (damaging property, parents not taking responsibility), they went to the manager. The manager's action was to ask the family to leave. The author didn't confront the family directly but went through the manager. However, the author did curse back, which is unprofessional and possibly escalated the situation. The slow clap might be seen as mocking, which is unkind.\n\nBut the key points are: the parents failed to manage their child's actions, and the kid's behavior (whether due to autism or not) led to damages. The author tried to handle it by involving the manager, which is a reasonable step. However, the author's choice to curse and mock the family could be seen as crossing a line, even if provoked. The parents' lack of responsibility is a major factor here. The author's initial intention was to resolve the issue by contacting the manager, which is appropriate. The anger and cursing might not be justified, but the main issue is the parents' behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by involving the manager and escalating with cursing. But given that the parents were dismissive and the kid kept causing issues, the author might have had a right to seek help. The parents are in more wrong here for not controlling their child and being disrespectful. The author's actions, while perhaps harsh in the end (cursing and slow clap), were a response to provocation. The author might not be in the wrong for the initial report to the manager but the personal insults might make them partially at fault. However, the parents' behavior was worse. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not being more patient and for the hostile response. The initial part is okay, but the cursing and slow clap are problematic. So maybe A (at fault) for the personal actions. Hmm. It's tricky. In AITA situations, the line is often about how the person handled it. Since the author went to the manager, which is appropriate, but added personal insults, maybe the answer is A or B. The parents are clearly at fault for letting the child cause damage and not apologizing, but the author's cursing and slow clap might make them share some blame. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm conflicted. Alternatively, the main wrong is the parents, so the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
