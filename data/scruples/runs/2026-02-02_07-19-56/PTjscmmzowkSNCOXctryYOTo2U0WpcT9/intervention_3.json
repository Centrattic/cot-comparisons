Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a kid with autism and his parents causing issues at a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the kid unplugs the author's earphones and spills drinks on their laptop. The parents don't apologize, which angers the author. The author then calls the manager, gets the family kicked out, and ends up cursing. The kid has autism, and the author feels bad about it later.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the kid's behavior was disruptive, possibly due to autism. The parents didn't take responsibility. The author's reaction involved escalating the situation by cursing and getting the family removed. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the kid's actions were inconsiderate and damaging. Parents didn't act appropriately. The author tried to handle it calmly at first. On the other hand, the author escalated by cursing and getting the family thrown out, which might be seen as harsh, especially considering the kid's possible autism. The author's final act of clapping as they left could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nBut in a public place, parents are responsible for their children's actions. If a child is causing damage, the parents should address it. The manager's role is to maintain order. The author reporting the incident to the manager is reasonable. However, the author's cursing and slow clap might be seen as crossing the line, regardless of the parents' behavior. The parents could have been more understanding, but the author's response might have been overly aggressive.\n\nAlso, the parents' behavior in not apologizing is problematic. They might have been inconsiderate. The author's anger is understandable, but responding with cursing might not have been the best approach. However, the manager's decision to ask them to leave could be justified given the damage. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their reaction had elements that could be seen as excessive.\n"
