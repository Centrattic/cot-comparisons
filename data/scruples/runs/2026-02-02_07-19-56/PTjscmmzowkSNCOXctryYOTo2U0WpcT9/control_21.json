Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child being asked to leave a coffee shop after some incidents. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was working at a coffee shop, and a family came in. The dad shoved the kid when they sat down. Then the kid took the author's earphones, maybe due to sensory issues or not understanding social cues. The author calmly told the kid, who then threw the earphones. The parents were arguing loudly, and the kid spilled a drink on the author's devices. The dad dismissed the spill and laughed, not apologizing. The author told the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, and the author cursed back. The mom criticized the author for the kid being autistic, and the kid tried to approach the author but was dragged away.\n\nNow, the key points are: the kid's actions, the parents' responses, and the author's actions. The author was trying to work and was interrupted by the kid's actions, possibly due to autism. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility when the kid caused damage. The author reported the situation to the manager, leading to the family's removal. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nAutism can affect behavior, so the kid might not have known his actions were wrong. However, the parents have a responsibility to manage their child's behavior. If the kid's actions were due to his condition, the parents should have intervened to prevent damage. The dad's reaction (laughing) and the mom's silence suggest neglect. The author tried to address the issue by informing the manager, which is a reasonable step to protect their property. The author's anger and cursing might be a problem, but the main issue is the parents' failure to control their child. \n\nHowever, the act of having the family thrown out could be seen as harsh. The manager's decision to ask them to leave might be justified if the kid's actions were disruptive. But the author might have overstepped if they didn't give the parents a chance to correct the behavior immediately. On the other hand, the parents didn't take responsibility, so the manager's action was appropriate. The author's role was to report the incident, not to confront the parents aggressively. Cursing back could have escalated things unnecessarily. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are primarily at fault for not managing their child. The author was in a position where their work and property were at risk. The manager's decision to remove the family was likely in line with the coffee shop's policies for disturbances. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting the incidents. However, their reaction (cursing) might be questionable. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for the family being asked to leave. Since the parents didn't address the spills and the kid's behavior, the manager's action was justified based on the author's report. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for initiating the action, even if the parents were at fault. The answer might be B (No).\n"
