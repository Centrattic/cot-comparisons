Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child causing disturbances at a coffee shop, and the author had the family thrown out after an argument with the dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author was in a coffee shop, trying to work, and the child did some things that disrupted them. The child unplugged their earphones and later spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility, especially the dad, who laughed it off. The author reported the situation to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The parents reacted angrily, and the author cursed back. The mom accused the author of being a jerk for targeting a child with autism.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's response to the disruptions, the behavior of the parents, and the potential overreaction. The author claims they were trying to work and were disturbed. However, the child's actions might be due to autism, which could affect their behavior. The parents' lack of response and even mocking attitude might have contributed to the author's frustration.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author tried to handle it calmly at first, asked the dad politely, and only escalated when the dad was dismissive. The manager was involved, which is a standard procedure. On the other hand, the child's autism might mean they couldn't control their actions, and the parents' failure to manage the child properly could be their responsibility. The author's cursing back and public confrontation might be seen as excessive, but the dad's behavior (flipping the finger) could have provoked it.\n\nThe mom's statement about autism is important. She implied that the author was targeting the child because of his condition. The author's decision to have the family thrown out might have been based on the parents' failure to control their child, not the child's autism itself. However, the outcome was that the family was ejected, which could be seen as harsh if the child's behavior was due to autism and the parents were struggling.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are responsible for their child's behavior in public. If they didn't take appropriate steps to manage the child, they share fault. The author's reaction could be justified if the parents were neglectful. However, the author's own reaction (cursing) might not be appropriate regardless of the situation.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for having the family thrown out. If the manager decided to eject them based on the parents' behavior and the child's actions, maybe the author isn't solely at fault. However, the author did escalate the situation by involving the manager and engaging in the argument. The key is whether the parents' actions were sufficient to warrant being asked to leave, which the manager judged as appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' behavior was problematic, the author's response might have been a necessary action to protect their own work and safety. However, the way it was handled, including the cursing, could be seen as excessive. But the core issue is the parents' responsibility for their child's actions. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
