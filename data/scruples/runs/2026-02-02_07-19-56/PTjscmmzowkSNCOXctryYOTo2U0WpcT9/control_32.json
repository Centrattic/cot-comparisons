Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a family with a kid who has autism being thrown out of a coffee shop. The author is the one who reported them to the manager.\n\nFirst, the kid did some things that bothered the author: unplugging their earphones violently and spilling a drink on their laptop. The author mentions trying to work and being observant. The parents didn't seem to respond appropriately when the spills happened, even laughing or smirking. The dad even gave the author the finger, and the author cursed back. The mom called the author a jerk for the kid having autism.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's actions were justified. The kid's behavior might be due to autism, so maybe the parents should have been more attentive. However, the parents didn't intervene when the kid spilled the drink, which could have caused damage to the author's laptop. The author reported them, leading to them being asked to leave. The dad's aggressive response and the mom's comment might complicate things.\n\nBut the author did approach the manager first, which is a reasonable step when there's an issue. The parents' lack of responsibility and the dad's physical aggression (giving the finger, dragging the kid) might support the author's actions. However, the kid being autistic is a factor. The author might have felt wronged by the parents' behavior, but reacting with a curse and a slow clap could be seen as harsh.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. The parents were negligent, but the kid's actions might be beyond his control. The author's response was to involve the manager, which is acceptable. However, the public confrontation and cursing back might not be the best approach. The author felt bad for the kid later, showing some remorse.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. They had a valid reason to be upset about the spills and the parents' inaction. But their reaction might have been escalated by the dad's behavior. However, the manager did ask them to leave, which is the proper procedure. The author's actions led to the family being asked to leave, which might be justified given the parents' negligence and the dad's hostility. The kid's autism is a consideration, but the parents' response was worse. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but their reaction could have been more measured. However, given the dad's actions, maybe it's understandable. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance here.\n"
