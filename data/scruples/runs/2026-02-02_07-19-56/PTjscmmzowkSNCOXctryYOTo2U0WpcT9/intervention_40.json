Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a coffee shop where the author is working alone with earphones. A family comes in, and their kid unplugs the earphones and spills a drink on the author's laptop. The parents don't seem to take responsibility, and the author reports them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The kid has autism, and the parents are arguing about cheating. The author curses back when the dad gives them the finger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both the author and the family. The kid's actions\u2014unplugging earphones and spilling the drink\u2014could be due to his autism, which might affect his behavior. The parents' reaction is questionable. If the kid has autism, the parents might need to manage his behavior more effectively in public. However, the dad's response to the author's complaint was dismissive and even mocking, saying to dry it with a napkin. The mom didn't help, and both had smug smiles. That seems disrespectful and irresponsible.\n\nThe author, on the other hand, approached the manager, which is a reasonable step when there's a problem. The manager then asked the family to leave. The author's anger leading to cursing back and the slow clap might be seen as escalating the situation. However, considering the parents' behavior, the author might feel justified in standing up for themselves.\n\nNow, the key points: Was the author's action of reporting the family appropriate? Since the kid damaged the author's property and the parents weren't addressing it, reporting to the manager is a valid action. The manager has the authority to enforce shop policies. However, the author's decision to curse back and the slow clap could be seen as unprofessional and possibly contributing to the escalation. Also, the parents might have had valid reasons for their behavior, like the kid's autism, and the author might have overreacted.\n\nBut considering the parents didn't take responsibility and the kid's actions were harmful, the author's main action (reporting to the manager) was probably justified. The aftermath (cursing) isn't great, but the initial step was reasonable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents' behavior was worse, and the manager handled the situation. So, the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the author could have handled the cursing better but not the main action. So, answer B (not in the wrong) seems right.\n"
