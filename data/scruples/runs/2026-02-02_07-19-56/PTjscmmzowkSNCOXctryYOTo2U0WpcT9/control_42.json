Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child being thrown out of a coffee shop. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was working alone in a coffee shop when a family entered. The parents seemed to be arguing, and their autistic child acted out by unplugging the author's earphones and spilling a drink on the author's laptop. When the author confronted the father, he was dismissive, leading the author to involve the manager. The manager asked the family to leave, which resulted in conflict, and the author cursed back. The mom accused the author of targeting a child with autism.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they were trying to work and were disturbed by the child's actions. The parents didn't intervene when the child caused damage, which is concerning. The father's reaction was to mock the situation, which might justify the author's frustration. However, the author did report the incident to the manager and didn't directly cause the family to leave without reason. The manager made the decision, not the author.\n\nBut there are nuances. The author assumed the child was autistic without confirmation, which might affect their judgment. They also cursed back, which isn't ideal. However, the parents' behavior\u2014allowing their child to damage property and not apologizing\u2014could be seen as neglectful. The key points are whether the author overreacted or if the parents failed in their duties.\n\nIn public spaces, businesses can ask people to leave if they cause a disturbance. Since the child's actions, combined with the parents' lack of responsibility, created a disturbance, the manager's action might be justified. The author's role was to report the incident, not to act on their own. The cursing and confrontation might make the author partially at fault, but the main issue is the parents' lack of control and the manager's intervention.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The initial reaction to protect their property is understandable, but the escalation might have been avoidable. However, the parents' behavior was problematic. The answer might be B (No) because the author acted within their right to report the incident, and the manager handled the eviction. The author's main wrongdoing is perhaps the verbal exchange, but the core issue lies with the parents. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
