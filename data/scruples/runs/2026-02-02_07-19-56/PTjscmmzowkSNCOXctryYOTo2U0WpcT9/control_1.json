Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child being asked to leave a coffee shop after some incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both the author and the family. The family's kid unplugged the author's earphones and spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't apologize and even seemed dismissive. The author approached the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, and the author cursed back. The mom accused the author of targeting the autistic child.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and children with autism might have different behaviors. The author suspected the kid might be autistic, which is why their actions might be misunderstood. The parents' lack of responsibility is a key point here. The kid's actions could be due to his condition, but the parents didn't take responsibility, which is concerning.\n\nThe author's reaction: they tried to address the issue politely at first. When confronted with no action from the parents, they went to the manager. The manager then took action. However, the author did curse back at the dad, which isn't great. But the main issue is whether removing the family was justified.\n\nThe parents' behavior is problematic. They didn't discipline the child or apologize. The kid's actions might be due to his condition, but the parents' neglect is worse. The author's actions in reporting the issue to the manager could be seen as necessary to protect their property and work. However, the public removal and the author's cursing might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nBut considering the parents' behavior, the manager's role is to maintain a safe environment. The author's intent was to protect their belongings. The kid was harmed by being kicked out, but the parents' negligence is a bigger issue. The author might feel conflicted but isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the way they reacted (cursing) is not advisable. The key is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The manager handled the situation, so the author might share some responsibility, but the main fault is on the parents.\n"
