Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for having a family with an autistic child thrown out of a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a coffee shop, working with earphones. A family enters, the child unplugs their earphones and throws them. Then the kid spills a drink on the author's laptop. The parents don't apologize, and the author reports them. The manager asks them to leave, leading to an argument. The author curses back, and the mother calls the author a jerk for targeting a child with autism.\n\nSo, the key points here. The child's actions caused damage to the author's property. The parents didn't take responsibility, which might have escalated the situation. The author's response was to involve the manager, which led to the family being asked to leave. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nAutism is a factor here. The child might have sensory issues or not understand social norms, leading to the unplugging of the earphones and the spill. However, the parents' behavior is also questionable\u2014they didn't intervene or apologize, which could have contributed to the conflict.\n\nThe author's responsibility: Did they have a right to ask the manager to remove the family? If the parents were not addressing the situation, the author might be within their rights to seek help. But considering the child's autism, maybe the approach could have been different. For example, the author could have asked the parents to supervise better instead of immediately involving management. However, the parents' refusal to take responsibility might have left the author with no choice.\n\nThe author's reaction of cursing back and the slow clap might be seen as uncalled for, but the initial action of reporting the incident could be justified. The manager made the decision to ask them to leave, so the author isn't directly responsible for that. The mother's accusation that the child was kicked out because of autism is a concern. The author didn't know about the autism until after the fact, so there's no intent to target based on that.\n\nIn summary, the parents' lack of responsibility and the child's actions led to the situation. The author acted to protect their property and work, which is understandable. The main issue is whether the response was appropriate. While the author's approach might have been hasty, given the parents' behavior, it's debatable. However, the key factor is that the parents weren't doing their job, so the author might not be at fault. The answer is B (No), because the author wasn't in the wrong.\n"
