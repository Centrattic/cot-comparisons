Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was at a coffee shop, and a family with a kid who has autism came in. The parents left the kid, who then unplugged their earphones and spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't apologize, and the author told the manager to throw the family out. The kid was crying, and the parents reacted angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both the author and the family. The kid is autistic, which might mean he has different behaviors that aren't intentional. The parents left him unattended when ordering, which could be a problem. The kid's actions\u2014taking the earphones and spilling the drink\u2014might be due to his condition, not malice. The parents' response (smirking, not apologizing) seems dismissive and possibly contributing to the problem.\n\nThe author's reaction: they approached the manager and had the family removed. The dad was aggressive, and the author cursed back. The mom criticized the author for targeting an autistic child. The author felt bad later, showing some remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author might have felt their work was at risk and acted to protect their property. On the other hand, the kid's behavior might be due to his disability, and the parents might not have adequately managed their child. The author's response was to involve the manager, which is a reasonable step when faced with property damage and uncooperative parents. However, the author also cursed back, which could be inappropriate.\n\nBut the key factors here are: the parents left the child unattended, the parents' dismissive attitude towards the incidents, and the fact that the child is autistic. The author's actions led to the family being removed, but the parents' behavior was problematic. The author's initial reaction was to address the immediate issue (spilled drink), which was a valid concern to prevent data loss. The manager's intervention was appropriate. The author's anger and cursing might be a bad example, but the main issue was the parents' lack of responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the parents failed to control their child and were dismissive. The author acted to protect their work and property. The answer might be B (No). But I need to check if the author overstepped. However, since they involved the manager and didn't handle it themselves, it's probably justified. The parents were at fault for not managing their autistic child properly in a public place. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
