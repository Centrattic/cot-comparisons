Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having the family of an autistic kid thrown out of the coffee shop. The story is a bit detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is at a coffee shop, working on their laptop with earphones. A family enters, the kid is autistic. The kid unplugs the author's earphones and throws them. The parents seem to argue about cheating, the kid spills a drink on the author's laptop. The author confronts the dad, who doesn't apologize, so the author tells the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad gets angry, flips them off, and the mom calls the author a jerk. The kid might have tried to apologize, but the dad dragged him away. The author feels bad later.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the parents didn't apologize, and their kid caused damage. On the other, the kid is autistic, and maybe the parents were handling it as best as they could. The author is a customer, so they have a right to protect their property. However, the resolution led to the kid being thrown out, which could be traumatic, especially if the kid was already upset.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author overreacted. The kid's actions were problematic, but the parents didn't respond appropriately. The author reported it to the manager, which is a reasonable step. However, the author cursed back and did a slow clap, which might have escalated things. Also, the mom accused the author of targeting the kid because of autism, which the author didn't know at the time. The author later felt bad, recognizing the parents were poor role models.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents didn't take responsibility and the kid's actions were harmful, then the author's actions might be justified. But if the author could have handled it more calmly or if the parents were struggling, maybe not the best approach. The manager's role is important too; they should handle such situations. The author's decision to involve the manager was appropriate, but their own reactions (cursing, slow clap) might not be. However, the main issue is the manager's decision to throw them out. The author might not be directly at fault for that action, as they reported the incident. But the question is about the author's role in the situation.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions were reasonable. The parents didn't take responsibility, the kid caused damage, and the manager acted. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting the incident. However, the way they handled it (cursing back, public confrontation) could be seen as excessive. But the core issue is the manager's decision, which the author didn't control. The author's initial reaction (reporting the spill) was reasonable. The parents' behavior was inconsiderate. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they protected their property and reported the incident. However, the mom's comment implies the author didn't know about the autism beforehand, which adds complexity. The author might have overreacted by escalating the situation, but the parents' inaction was a factor. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is B. The author acted within their rights to report the damage and protect their work. The parents' failure to take responsibility led to the outcome. However, the author's personal reactions (cursing, slow clap) might not make them wrong for the main action of reporting. So, the answer is B.\n"
