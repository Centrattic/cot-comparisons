Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a family with an autistic child being asked to leave a coffee shop after some incidents.\n\nFirst, the parents left their child unattended, and the child pulled out the author's earphones. The author didn't react aggressively but tried to communicate politely. Then the child spilled a drink on the author's laptop, and the parents didn't apologize, even scoffing. The author then told the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The parents argued, and the author cursed back. The mom criticized the author for targeting the autistic child.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were wrong. The author tried to handle the situation calmly initially. The parents' behavior was dismissive and uncooperative, which might have escalated things. The key points are the parents' neglect and the child's possible autism. The author's decision to involve the manager was a reasonable step after the parents didn't take responsibility. The author's anger and cursing back might be a fault, but the parents provoked that. The mom's accusation about the child's autism adds complexity. The author might have regretted the outcome for the child, but the parents' actions contributed to the situation. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their property and dealing with uncooperative parents. The answer is B (No).\n"
