Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person at a coffee shop dealing with a family that includes a kid with autism. The key points are the kid's actions and the parents' responses.\n\nFirst, the kid unplugs the author's earphones and then throws them. The author tries to communicate politely, but the kid then spills a drink on the laptop and phone. The parents don't apologize, which leads the author to involve the manager. The manager asks the family to leave, and there's an argument where the author curses back. The mom criticizes the author for kicking out the kid with autism, and the author feels bad in retrospect.\n\nNow, considering the scenario: the kid has autism, which might affect his behavior. Autistic children can have sensory issues or act out due to various reasons. The parents' behavior is also a factor here. They didn't intervene when the kid caused damage, and even laughed it off. The author's reaction was to inform the manager, which is a standard procedure in such cases. However, the author did curse back when the dad gave the finger, which might be seen as escalating the situation.\n\nBut the main question is about the author's responsibility. Did they overreact? The kid's actions were disruptive and damaging. The parents' lack of accountability is concerning. The author tried to handle it calmly first, then escalated to the manager. The manager's decision to ask the family to leave might have been appropriate. However, the author's cursing could be seen as inappropriate. But the core issue is whether the initial action of reporting the incident was wrong. Since the parents didn't take responsibility, the author's actions were likely justified. The author also felt remorse, showing they considered the kid's situation. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
