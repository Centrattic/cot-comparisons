Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic kid thrown out of a coffee shop. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was in a coffee shop working, when a family came in. The kid, who might be autistic, did some things: unplugged the author's earphones, threw them, spilled a drink on the laptop. The parents didn't seem to apologize or take responsibility. The author then reported the incident to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad reacted angrily, the mom called the author a jerk for affecting the autistic child, and the kid tried to apologize. The author felt bad later about the kid's situation.\n\nSo the main points are: the kid's behavior (which could be due to autism), the parents' lack of response, and the author's actions leading to the family being removed. Now, is the author in the wrong?\n\nAutism can affect a person's behavior, and kids with autism might not understand social norms or have sensory issues. The parents might have a child who can't control impulses. The kid's actions were disruptive, but were they intentional? If the kid is autistic, maybe he didn't mean to do those things. The parents' reaction suggests they didn't take responsibility, which is problematic. The author's response was to report to the manager, leading to removal. But the question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nIn public places, there's usually a standard of behavior. If the kid is causing harm or damage, the parents have a responsibility to manage that. The author's property was damaged (spilled drink on laptop and phone), which is a legitimate concern. However, the key issue is whether the author should have tried to handle it differently. The parents didn't apologize, so the author's action to involve the manager could be justified. But the author did curse back and got the family kicked out. The manager's role is to handle such situations, so maybe the author shouldn't have taken matters into their own hands, especially if the kid's behavior was due to a disability. However, the parents weren't preventing the damage, so the author's action to protect their property might be seen as reasonable. The problem is that the parents didn't respond, so the author had to escalate. On the other hand, the author's reaction (cursing back, slow clap) might be seen as over the top, but the manager's decision to ask the family out could be based on their own judgment. The author's initial actions (reporting the incident) might be justified, but the way they reacted (cursing) might not be. So, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting the damage, but maybe the way they handled the confrontation could be questioned. However, the parents' behavior was inexcusable, and the manager's role is to handle disturbances. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the parents failed to control their child, and the manager made the call. The kid's autism is a factor, but the parents are responsible for their child's actions. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if the author had a duty to accommodate the child's needs. But the parents are responsible for managing their child. If the parents didn't, the author's action to protect their property is justified. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
