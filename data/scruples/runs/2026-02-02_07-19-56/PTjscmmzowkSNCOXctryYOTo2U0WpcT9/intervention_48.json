Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person at a coffee shop dealing with a family with an autistic child. The author ends up having the family thrown out after a series of incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was working alone with earphones when the family came in. The kid pulled out their earphones violently, then spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility, leading the author to report the family to the manager, resulting in them being asked to leave. The author felt bad afterward, especially upon learning the child is autistic.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the author tried to handle the situation by politely speaking to the child and the father, but when the father didn't respond appropriately, they escalated to the manager. The manager's decision to remove the family might be based on the author's report. The question is whether the author acted wrongly.\n\nArguments against the author being in the wrong: They tried to communicate calmly, and the parents weren't apologetic. The child's actions caused damage to the author's property. The manager's role is to maintain order, so reporting the incident could be justified.\n\nArguments in favor of the author being in the wrong: The situation involved an autistic child, who might have challenges controlling their behavior. The parents might have been overwhelmed and unable to manage their child's actions. The author's reaction, including cursing and a slow clap, could be seen as harsh, especially after learning about the child's autism. The initial incidents, like pulling earphones and spilling a drink, might be typical of a child with autism who doesn't understand social cues, not necessarily misbehavior.\n\nAlso, the author's assumption about the child's autism before confirmation might have influenced their response. The parents' argument might have added to the stress for them, affecting their ability to manage their child.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: The parents should have supervised their child better, but the author's reaction in involving the manager could be seen as necessary to protect their property. However, the public shaming aspect (slow clap, cursing) might be excessive. The key is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The author's property was damaged, which is a valid concern, but the handling of the situation could have been more empathetic, considering the child's needs.\n\nSo, the answer depends on balancing the rights of the author to protect their belongings against the needs of a child with autism and their parents' responsibilities. The parents failed to address the child's actions, leading the author to seek help from the manager. However, the author's public confrontation and lack of initial empathy might make them partially at fault. But given the parents' inaction, the manager's decision to remove the family could be justified. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for criticism about their handling of the situation.\n"
