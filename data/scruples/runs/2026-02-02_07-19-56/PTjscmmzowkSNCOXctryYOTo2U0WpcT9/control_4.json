Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was at a coffee shop, and a family with a kid who's autistic came in. The kid did some things like yanking the author's earphones and spilling a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't seem to apologize and even gave the author the finger. The author then told the manager, who kicked the family out, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both the author and the family. The kid's behavior was definitely disruptive. Yanking earphones and spilling drinks is problematic, especially if it caused damage or loss of work. Since the kid is autistic, maybe he didn't mean to be malicious, but the parents' response is key here. The parents didn't apologize and even laughed it off, which could be seen as neglectful or inconsiderate.\n\nThe author tried to handle it politely at first, telling the kid about the earphones, and then addressing the parents when the spill happened. The parents' lack of remorse might have justified the author's frustration. The manager was called, and the family was asked to leave. The dad's aggressive response, giving the finger, led the author to curse back. The author also clapped sarcastically as they left.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents didn't take responsibility for their child's actions, which could be a red flag. The author tried to resolve it calmly but faced hostility. However, the manager is responsible for handling such situations, so maybe the author overstepped by getting the family kicked out, especially since the kid is autistic and might need accommodations. But the parents' behavior was also a factor. The author's reaction, while understandable given the parents' attitude, could have been more measured. Cursing back and the slow clap might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents didn't act responsibly. The dad's shove, lack of apology, and aggressive behavior are problematic. The author might have felt justified in their actions. But considering the child's disability, maybe the manager should have handled it more carefully, but the parents' actions contributed to the escalation.\n\nSo, the author's main mistake might be taking it to the manager without maybe giving the parents a chance to correct their behavior first. But given the repeated offenses and the parents' hostile response, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were in response to the parents' negligence and aggression. However, the way the author handled the aftermath (cursing) might not be appropriate. But overall, the parents were at fault for not managing their child and responding inappropriately. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides."
