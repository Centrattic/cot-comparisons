Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a kid with autism whose family caused some incidents in a coffee shop, leading to them being asked to leave.\n\nFirst, the kid unplugged the author's earphones and threw them. The author handled it politely, which is good. Then the kid spilled a drink on the author's phone and laptop. The parents didn't apologize and even laughed, which is concerning. The author went to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, and the author cursed back. The mom called the author a jerk for kicking out a kid with autism. The author felt bad later for the kid.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the kid's behavior was disruptive, and the parents didn't take responsibility. The author reported the incident to the manager, which is appropriate when property is involved. The manager's decision to ask them to leave might be based on the parents' refusal to control their child and the potential damage. However, the author's reaction of cursing back and giving a slow clap could be seen as unprofessional or escalating the situation. The parents' behavior is definitely part of the problem, especially their dismissiveness. The kid might have a disability, but the parents are responsible for managing their child's actions. The author's initial action of informing the manager was right, but the verbal confrontation might have crossed a line. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting, but maybe the response to the dad's finger was excessive. The overall responsibility is split, but the main issue is the parents' lack of accountability. The author's actions were a reaction to provocation. The key is whether the author overstepped by involving the manager and cursing. Since the parents didn't apologize and the kid caused damage, the author's actions were justified up to a point. The slow clap and cursing might be a bit much, but given the parents' behavior, it's understandable. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
