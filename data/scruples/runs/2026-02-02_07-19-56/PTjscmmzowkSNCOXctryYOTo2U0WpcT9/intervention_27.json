Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family with an autistic child causing disturbances in a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the author was working, which is understandable. The family entered, and the dad shoved the kid. Then, the kid unplugged the author's earphones and threw them. The author tried to address it politely. The parents were arguing loudly, which the author overheard. The kid spilled drinks on the author's devices, and the dad dismissed it with a joke. The author then reported this to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad gave the finger, and the author cursed back. The mom criticized the author for targeting the autistic kid.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The author did act after the kid's actions (spilling drinks, the dad's dismissive response). The manager was involved, which is a proper step. However, the author used earphones, which might have been a factor in the kid's action. Also, the author cursed back, which escalates the situation. The key here is whether the author overreacted by calling the manager and contributing to the family being thrown out. The parents didn't take responsibility, which is a problem. The kid being autistic adds context, but the parents' behavior is also a significant factor. The author's initial reaction was to report the incident when their property was damaged. However, cursing back might be seen as inappropriate. The answer hinges on whether the author's response was proportionate. The parents' lack of accountability is a major point here. The author might not be in the wrong for protecting their belongings, but the public cursing could be a misstep. However, the main issue is the manager's decision to involve the family. Since the parents were dismissive and the kid's actions were due to his condition, maybe the author's approach was justified. But the author could have handled it differently. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) for cursing and escalating, but the manager's role complicates it. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author reported the incident to the manager, which is reasonable, but the cursing back is unprofessional. The answer might be A because of the aggressive response. Alternatively, considering the parents' behavior, the author might not be wrong. Hmm. The answer is tricky. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key points are: the kid's actions were due to autism, the parents didn't take responsibility, the author cursed back. The manager's action was based on the author's report. The author's main mistake was the verbal escalation. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
