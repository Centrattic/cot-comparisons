Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who had a family with a child who has autism thrown out of a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the author was in the coffee shop, working. The family came in, and the parent's behavior was questionable\u2014like shoving the child. The child then unplugged the author's earphones, spilled a drink on the laptop, and the parents didn't respond appropriately. The author went to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad was rude, and the author cursed back. The mom criticized the author for targeting a child with autism, which the author later confirmed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The parents' actions\u2014especially the dad's behavior and the lack of response to the child's actions\u2014could be seen as neglectful. The child might have needs that the parents aren't addressing, which led to the incidents. The author acted based on frustration, but maybe escalated the situation by calling the manager and getting angry. However, the parents' inaction might justify the author's actions to some extent.\n\nAutism considerations: The child's behavior might be due to his condition, and the parents should manage it. The author's decision to report the incident could be seen as necessary to protect their property, but the method (throwing the family out publicly) might be harsh. The author's reaction of cursing might not be appropriate, but the parents' behavior provoked it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties may have contributed. However, the parents' failure to supervise and their dismissive attitude are significant. The author's actions were a response to damage to their property and lack of accountability. While the author could have handled it more calmly, the parents' behavior was a major factor. The key point is whether the author overstepped. Since the manager was involved, it's within the shop's policy to ask disruptive customers to leave. The author was within their rights to report the incident. However, the public confrontation and cursing might not be justified. \n\nBut considering the parents' role, the author's actions might be justified as a response to negligence. The answer depends on whether the parents' actions were the primary issue, making the author's response reasonable. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a balance here. The answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parents' behavior was worse, but the author's reaction could have been calmer. However, the manager's decision to eject them was appropriate based on the circumstances. So, B.\n"
