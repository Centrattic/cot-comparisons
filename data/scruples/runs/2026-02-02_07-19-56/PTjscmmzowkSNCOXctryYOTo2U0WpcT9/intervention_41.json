Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation involves a kid with autism whose family was asked to leave a coffee shop. The author is the one who went to the manager after their earphones were pulled out and their laptop and phone were spilled on. The parents didn't apologize, and the author got angry enough to curse and have them kicked out.\n\nHmm, the key points to consider are: Did the author act appropriately given the circumstances? The kid had autism, so maybe his actions weren't intentional. The parents' response (laughing and not apologizing) might have been a factor in the author's decision. But throwing the kid out because of the parents' negligence? Or because of the kid's behavior?\n\nThe author mentions they tried to ignore the kid at first. The kid pulled out the earphones and spilled the drink. The parents didn't help, which escalated the situation. The author then went to the manager. So, in terms of responsibility, the parents are at fault for not supervising their child. The author's reaction was to involve management, which is a reasonable step when someone else's child is causing damage. However, the way the author handled it\u2014cursing and giving a slow clap\u2014might be seen as excessive. Also, the mom criticized the author for targeting a kid with autism, which adds a layer of sensitivity.\n\nBut the kid's actions did cause damage. The parents' lack of accountability is part of the problem. The author's initial reaction was to ask the dad, who didn't help. Then escalating to the manager is a standard approach. However, the final step of cursing and dragging out the kid might be seen as overstepping, especially considering the child's needs. The question is whether the author was wrong in removing the family based on the parents' failure to control their child.\n\nOn one hand, the parents are responsible for their child's actions. On the other, the author's response included public shaming and cursing, which could be seen as unkind. The answer might hinge on whether the manager's decision was appropriate. If the manager felt the family was disruptive, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the manager acted solely on the author's word, maybe the author should have handled it differently. Also, the kid was crying, which might indicate that the parents were under stress. The author felt bad for the kid afterward, showing some guilt, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author did take the right steps by informing the manager, but the personal insults and public confrontation might tip the scales. However, given that the parents were at fault and the kid caused damage, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the information.\n"
