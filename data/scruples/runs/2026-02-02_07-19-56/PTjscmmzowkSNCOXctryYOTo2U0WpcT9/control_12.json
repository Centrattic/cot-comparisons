Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is at fault. The scenario involves a family with an autistic child where the kid spills something on the author's laptop, leading to the family being asked to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author mentions that the child pulled out their earphones and spilled a drink on their laptop. The parents, specifically the dad, didn't seem to take responsibility, even smirking and telling the kid to dry it off. The author then reports this to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad reacted angrily, even giving the finger, and the mom accused the author of targeting a kid with autism.\n\nOn one hand, the parents' behavior is concerning. The dad shoved the kid, didn't address the spill, and was dismissive. The mom didn't intervene. The parents might not have been properly supervising the child, which could be a problem. The fact that the kid is autistic is important here; maybe he didn't understand the social cues or actions. Parents might need to be more attentive, especially if the child's behavior isn't within typical norms.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did approach the parents directly, asking about the spill. Then they went to the manager, which is a reasonable step. However, when the manager asked the family to leave, the author got angry and cursed back, which might not be the best response. Also, the dad's reaction was aggressive, but the author's retaliation could have escalated the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' lack of supervision and response to the child's actions, and the author's handling of the situation. The author might have escalated it by getting angry and cursing, but the parents' inaction was also a problem. However, the author's initial action of reporting the spill to the manager was appropriate. The manager is responsible for maintaining the environment, so that's their role. The author might not be entirely at fault for wanting to protect their property, but their response could have been more measured.\n\nAlso, the mom's comment about the kid having autism adds another layer. The author didn't know about the autism until then, so maybe they could have approached it differently, considering the child's possible needs. However, the parents' failure to manage their child's behavior is their responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents are clearly at fault for not managing their child and the situation, the author's response of cursing back might have been unnecessary. However, the main issue was the parents' inaction. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they handled the situation. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), because the parents' behavior was worse, and the author acted within reason by reporting the incident to the manager. The cursing was a misstep, but the main fault lies with the parents.\n"
