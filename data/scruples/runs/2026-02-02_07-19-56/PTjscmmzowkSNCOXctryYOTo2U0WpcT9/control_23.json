Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a family with a child who has autism being asked to leave a coffee shop. The writer, who was working there, had their earphones pulled out and their laptop and phone spilled on. The parents didn't apologize, and the writer then called the manager to have the family removed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The child's behavior\u2014pulling the earphones and spilling the drink\u2014could be due to autism, which might involve sensory issues or difficulty understanding social cues. However, the parents' response is crucial here. They didn't intervene or apologize when their child caused damage. The father even laughed and told the writer to use a napkin, which shows a lack of responsibility.\n\nThe writer's reaction was to involve the manager, which is a reasonable step when property is at risk. The writer was also polite initially, trying to resolve the issue calmly. The manager's decision to ask the family to leave might be based on the parents' non-cooperation. However, the writer did curse back, which could be seen as escalating the conflict. The mom's comment about the child having autism adds context, but the parents' behavior is still questionable.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the parents are responsible for managing their child's behavior in public. The writer had the right to protect their property and work. While the child's autism is a factor, it doesn't excuse the parents' lack of intervention. The writer's actions were a response to the parents' inaction and disrespect. The curse and slow clap might be seen as unprofessional, but given the provocation, some might understand the frustration.\n\nBalancing both sides, the parents were at fault for not handling their child's actions, and the writer acted within their rights to seek a resolution. The writer's regret after the incident shows they considered the child's well-being, but the parents' neglect is more concerning. So, the answer would be that the writer isn't in the wrong (B), but the parents are.\n"
