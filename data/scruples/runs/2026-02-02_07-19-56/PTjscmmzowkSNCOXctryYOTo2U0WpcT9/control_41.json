Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a coffee shop where a kid with autism is with his family. The writer was there working and the kid did some things like pulling their earphones and spilling a drink on their laptop. The parents seemed dismissive, and the writer ended up having the family thrown out. Now they're asking if they're the a**hole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to look at each action step by step. The kid initially unplugs the earphones. The writer responds politely, which seems reasonable. Then the kid throws the earphones, which the writer shrugs off, maybe considering the possibility of autism. That's good because they're trying to be understanding.\n\nNext, the parents argue about cheating in a loud tone. The kid is playing near the writer's table. Then the spill happens. The writer tells the dad, who responds with a smug comment. The dad's behavior here is pretty inconsiderate. The writer then goes to the manager, which is a reasonable step when someone else isn't taking responsibility. The manager asks the family to leave. The dad argues, gives the finger, and the writer curses back. The mom accuses the writer of targeting a kid with autism, which is a sensitive point.\n\nThe key factors here are the parents' responsibility. The dad shoved the kid earlier, didn't apologize after the spill, and was confrontational. The parents might not be handling the situation well, especially with a child who has special needs. The writer tried to handle the situation calmly, first confronting the dad, then involving the manager when the dad didn't take responsibility. The writer's actions were to protect their property and work. However, the writer did curse back, which could be seen as escalating the conflict. Also, the kid was thrown out, which might have been traumatic, especially since he was already upset.\n\nBut considering the parents' behavior and the fact that they didn't take responsibility for their child's actions, maybe the writer wasn't wrong to act. On the other hand, maybe there was a better way to handle it without involving the manager immediately. However, given that the parents didn't take responsibility and the spill could have damaged the equipment, the writer's actions might be justified. The curse back might be a point against them, but the main issue is the parents' negligence. The kid might not be at fault, but the parents are responsible for their child's actions. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with some nuances about the parents' responsibility and the writer's possible overreaction in cursing.\n"
