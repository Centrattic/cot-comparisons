Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a coffee shop incident involving a kid with autism and the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was working in a coffee shop when a family entered. The kid, possibly autistic, unplugged their earphones, spilled a drink on their laptop, and the parents didn't apologize. The author reported the family to the manager, leading to them being thrown out. The parents and kid reacted angrily. Now the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is a customer whose work was disrupted, and the parents didn't take responsibility. On the other hand, the kid might have a disability, and maybe the author overreacted. \n\nBut in public places, there's an expectation of respecting others' belongings. The kid's actions were intentional or due to lack of supervision. The parents' response (laughing, not apologizing) could be seen as dismissive. The author escalated by cursing back, which isn't great, but the manager was involved to handle the situation. \n\nAutism doesn't excuse harmful behavior, but parents might need to manage their child's actions. However, the parents here didn't take responsibility. The author was trying to protect their work and property. So, while the author might have handled it with more calmness, the main fault lies with the parents for not supervising their child and being disrespectful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for acting to protect their belongings and work.\n"
