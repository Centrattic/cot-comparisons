Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was in a coffee shop working, and a family with a kid who has autism came in. The kid did some things that disrupted the author's work, like unplugging their earphones and spilling a drink on their laptop. The parents didn't seem to take responsibility, which made the author report them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The author then cursed back at the dad, and the mom complained about the kid being kicked out because he has autism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both sides. The author was working and trying to be polite, but the kid's actions were disruptive. However, the kid might have autism, which can cause behaviors that are challenging in public. The parents' reaction was also problematic\u2014they didn't apologize, even when their kid caused damage. The author approached the manager, which is a reasonable step if they feel their property is at risk. But when the dad gave the finger and the author cursed back, that escalates the situation. Also, the mom's comment about the kid having autism adds a layer where the author might be seen as discriminating against someone with a disability.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the kid's actions were disruptive, and the parents didn't take responsibility. The author had a right to protect their belongings and report the issue. On the other hand, the author might have escalated the situation by cursing back and possibly overreacting. Also, kicking out a family because of a child's behavior, especially if the child has a disability, could be seen as unfair, especially if the parents were not fully at fault. The parents' negligence is a factor, but the author's public confrontation and the manager's decision to eject the family could have been handled more diplomatically.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to report the incident? Yes, if their work was at risk. Was the manager justified in removing the family? That depends on the shop's policies and the severity of the situation. However, the author's personal reaction\u2014cursing back\u2014might be seen as unprofessional and contributing to the conflict. The mom's argument that the child has autism is important; the author might not have considered accommodations needed for the child's condition. It's possible that the shop should handle such situations with more sensitivity towards customers with disabilities.\n\nIn summary, while the parents' behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response might have been too harsh, especially considering the child's needs. The author might be partly in the wrong for not handling the situation with more restraint and empathy.\n"
