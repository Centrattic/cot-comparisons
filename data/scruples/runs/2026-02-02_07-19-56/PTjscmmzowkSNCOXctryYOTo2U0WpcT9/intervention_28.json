Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person was at a coffee shop working on their laptop with earphones. A family comes in, and the kid does some things: unplugs the earphones violently, throws them, spills a drink on the laptop and phone. The parents don't seem to apologize, especially the dad, who laughs and tells the kid to dry it with a napkin. The author then reports the family to the manager, resulting in them being thrown out. The dad confronts the author, gives them the finger, and the author cusses back. The mom calls the author a jerk because the kid has autism. The author then claps as they leave.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the kid's actions were disruptive. Spilling drinks on someone's electronics can cause significant damage and loss of work. The parents' lack of response, even when confronted, is concerning. They didn't seem to take responsibility, which might have justified the author's actions in reporting them. The manager was within their right to ask the family to leave if their behavior was disruptive or harmful. The kid might have special needs, but the parents' response could be seen as negligent in managing their child's behavior in public.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction escalated the situation. Cursing back at the dad and doing a slow clap might be seen as overly aggressive or disrespectful, especially considering the child's possible autism. However, the author felt justified because the parents didn't take accountability. The key point is whether the author's actions were proportionate to the situation. Reporting the family to the manager for causing damage and being uncooperative could be reasonable. The parents might have been at fault for not controlling their child, and the manager's decision to eject them was their prerogative.\n\nAnother angle is the handling of the autistic child. The parents might have had challenges managing their child's behavior, and the author's public shaming could have been harsh. However, the parents didn't seem to take any responsibility initially, which might have justified the author's actions. The author did later feel bad about the kid, indicating they considered the child's perspective.\n\nIn terms of the coffee shop's policy, if the family was causing damage and not following rules, the manager's action was appropriate. The author's role was to report the issue, which they did. The cursing and slow clap might be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful, but if the parents were hostile, it's a reaction to that.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting the family, as the parents didn't address the damage their child caused. However, their own reaction (cursing) could be seen as unwise, but the core issue was the parents' failure to take responsibility. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the parents' negligence.\n"
