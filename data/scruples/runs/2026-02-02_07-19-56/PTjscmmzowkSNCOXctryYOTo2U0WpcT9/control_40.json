Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they were at a coffee shop, working with their laptop and earphones. A family comes in, and the kid with autism unplugs their earphones violently. The author asks politely, the kid throws them back. Then the kid spills a drink on the laptop and phone. The parents don't apologize, and the dad even smirks. The author tells the manager, who asks the family to leave. The dad gives the finger, and the mom calls the author a jerk for the kid being autistic. The author feels bad about it later.\n\nFirst, the kid's behavior: if the kid is on the autism spectrum, they might have sensory issues or not understand social boundaries. The parents might not be equipped to handle their child's behavior in public. When the kid spills the drink, the parents don't act, which is concerning. The author's main issue is losing work, which could be a big deal for them. But when they called the manager, the manager asked the family to leave. The dad's reaction is aggressive, and the mom blames the author for the kid being autistic.\n\nThe author's action was to report the incident to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The key here is whether the author overstepped. The kid's actions were disruptive, especially spilling something on the author's belongings. The parents' response was to ignore the problem, which might have justified the manager's intervention. However, the author might have escalated the situation by cursing back at the dad, which isn't professional. Also, the mom's comment about the kid's autism being a reason to not be treated that way adds complexity. The author might not have known about the autism until the mom mentioned it, so maybe they acted based on assumptions. The author later felt bad, showing they considered the kid's well-being. So, it's a mix of justified reactions to the parents' negligence and possibly mishandled the situation by getting into a verbal fight. The answer might be A since the author could have handled it differently without involving the manager immediately or cursing back, but also the parents were at fault too. Hmm.\n"
