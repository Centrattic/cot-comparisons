Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic child thrown out of a coffee shop. \n\nFirst, the context: The author was working at a coffee shop when a family entered. The parents seemed to have a troubled relationship, and their child, who is autistic, interacted with the author's belongings. The child pulled out the author's earphones and spilled a drink on the laptop. The parents didn't respond appropriately, leading the author to report the incident to the manager, resulting in the family being asked to leave. The author felt conflicted afterward because the child might be autistic.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The child's actions might be due to their condition\u2014autism can cause sensory issues or difficulty understanding social norms. However, the parents' response is troubling. They didn't take responsibility, laughed off the incident, and even the father gave a finger. The author's immediate reaction was to involve the manager, which led to the family being ejected.\n\nEthically, is the author at fault? The parents didn't seem to care about their child's behavior or the damage caused. The author's main concern was protecting their work and belongings. While the child's actions were harmful, the parents' lack of accountability is a factor. The author didn't confront the parents directly but went through the manager. The manager's decision to remove the family might be based on the store's policies regarding disruptive behavior.\n\nHowever, the author did curse back at the father, which could be seen as escalating the situation. Also, the child was autistic, and perhaps the parents needed more understanding or support, but the parents' behavior here was inconsiderate. The author's regret about the child's situation shows they weren't being malicious.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: The author's actions were a response to the parent's negligence and the child's actions. The parents' lack of responsibility might justify the manager's intervention. The author's approach might not be perfect, but the primary fault lies with the parents. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
