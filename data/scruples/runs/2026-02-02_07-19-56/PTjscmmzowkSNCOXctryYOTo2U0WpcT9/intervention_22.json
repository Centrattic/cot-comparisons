Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the events.\n\nThe author was at a coffee shop working on their laptop with earphones. A family came in, and the kid with autism did a few things: pulled out the author's earphones, threw them, spilled a drink on the laptop, and the parents didn't respond appropriately when the author complained. The author then reported the family to the manager, leading to them being asked to leave. The parents argued, the author cursed back, and the mom accused the author of being mean because the kid has autism. The author felt bad afterward but still wonders if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the actions taken by the author versus the parents' and child's behavior. The child's actions were disruptive, and the parents didn't seem to take responsibility. The author tried to handle it politely at first, then escalated by informing the manager. But the question is about whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the child's autism might explain some of his behaviors, like not understanding personal space or the consequences of his actions. However, the parents have a responsibility to supervise their child. If the parents were neglecting their duty, that's part of the problem. But the author's reaction was to have the family thrown out. Was that excessive?\n\nThe parents' lack of apology and the dad's smug reaction might have justified the author's frustration. However, the author chose to curse back and engage in an argument when the dad gave the finger. That part could be seen as the author escalating the situation unnecessarily. Also, having a family with a child who has autism removed from a public place might be controversial, as it could be seen as punishing the child for the parents' poor behavior. The mom's accusation that the author targeted the kid because of his autism adds another layer. The author might not have considered how their actions could be perceived as discrimination against a child with a disability.\n\nBut on the other hand, the parents didn't take responsibility, and the damage to the author's property was a real issue. The author tried to address it through the manager, which is a reasonable step. The question here is whether the manager's decision to ask the family to leave was appropriate given the circumstances. If the parents were not managing their child, the coffee shop might have a policy against disruptive behavior, so the manager's action could be justified. However, the author's own reaction of cursing and giving a slow clap could have been unprofessional and contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents definitely had a role in not supervising their child and not addressing the spills and the child's actions. The author's initial attempts to handle the situation politely were good, but the final interaction with the manager and the subsequent confrontation might have crossed a line. The author might have overreacted by involving the manager and then engaging in verbal abuse, which could be seen as in the wrong. However, the parents' behavior also contributed significantly to the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents are clearly at fault for not managing their child, but the author's actions in escalating the situation and using a curse word might place some blame on them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the parents were uncooperative and the child's actions were disruptive, the author's primary action of reporting it to the manager might be justifiable. However, the subsequent cursing and public confrontation could tip the scales. The answer might depend on cultural or situational norms, but based on the given information, the author might be partially at fault for the escalation, making them at least somewhat in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
