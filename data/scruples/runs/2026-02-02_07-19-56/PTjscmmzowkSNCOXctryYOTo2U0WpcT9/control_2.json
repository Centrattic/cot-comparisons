Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a family with an autistic child being asked to leave a coffee shop. The user is the one who reported the family to the manager. \n\nFirst, let's break down the events. The person was working at the coffee shop when a family came in. The kid, who might be autistic, unplugs their earphones and throws them. Then spilling a drink on the laptop and phone. The parents don't react helpfully, and when the manager asks them to leave, there's an argument.\n\nThe key points here are how the author handled the situation. The kid's actions are disruptive, but the parents aren't addressing it. The author confronts the dad, who doesn't take responsibility. The author then involves the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad gives the finger, and the mom accuses the author of targeting the autistic child. The author curses back and claps sarcastically.\n\nNow, considering the parents' behavior: they didn't help, laughed, and the dad shoved the kid earlier. The kid's actions were harmful (damaging property), and the parents didn't take responsibility. However, when the manager intervenes, the kid is crying, and the mom calls the author a jerk. \n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. Did they overreact? Well, the kid's actions did cause damage. The author tried to handle it politely first, then involved the manager. It's within the shop's right to ask someone to leave for causing damage. The author's response in anger (cursing back, clapping) might be seen as unprofessional or contributing to escalation. However, the main issue is the parents' negligence. \n\nIs it the author's fault? The kid was already there, and the parents weren't managing their child. The author reported the damage, which is reasonable. The part where they cursed and clapped might be uncalled for, but the main action of reporting to the manager is justified. The parents are more at fault for not controlling their child and reacting poorly. \n\nBut the mom's comment about the child being autistic adds another layer. However, the child did cause damage, so the parents should still take responsibility. The author might have been right to involve the manager. The answer likely depends on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since the parents didn't help and the kid was disruptive, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking them to leave.\n"
