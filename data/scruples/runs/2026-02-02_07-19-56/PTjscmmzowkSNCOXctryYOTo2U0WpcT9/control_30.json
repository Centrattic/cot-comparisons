Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is at fault. The situation involves a family with a child who might have autism, causing some disruptions in a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the author was working alone, using their laptop with earphones. The family entered, and the child pulled out their earphones. The author handled it politely, assuming the child might have autism. Then, the parents argued loudly about cheating, and the child spilled a drink on the author's equipment. The parents didn't apologize, leading the author to report them to the manager, resulting in their removal. The author felt bad later but is unsure if they were right.\n\nKey points to consider: The child's actions were disruptive, possibly due to autism. The parents didn't take responsibility, even after the spill. The author tried to ignore the situation initially but acted when the damage occurred. The parents' behavior was dismissive and even hostile, with the father flipping the author off. The author cursed back, which might be a point against them. However, the parents weren't apologizing for their child's actions, and the manager intervened. \n\nAutism considerations: Children with autism might not understand social cues or boundaries. However, the parents have a responsibility to manage their child's behavior in public. If the parents were aware of the spill and didn't address it, they're at fault. The author's initial reaction was calm, and only after repeated offenses did they escalate. The child was upset when removed, but the parents' behavior was worse. \n\nThe author's actions led to the family being asked to leave, which might be seen as harsh, but given the parents' lack of accountability, it might be justified. The author's cursing back could be a negative point, but the parents provoked that. So, the author isn't entirely at fault. The manager's role is also important; they made the final decision. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author could have handled it differently (like contacting the manager sooner), the parents' inaction was a major factor. The author's actions were a response to negligence. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
