Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is at a coffee shop, working on their laptop with earphones. A family with a kid comes in, and there's some tension between the parents. The kid unplugs the earphones, throws them, spills a drink on the laptop and phone. The parents don't apologize, leading the author to report the family to the manager. The family gets thrown out, and the author feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, the kid's actions: pulling earphones and spilling drinks are definitely disruptive. The parents' response\u2014laughing and not apologizing\u2014could indicate they didn't take the situation seriously. The author tried to handle it calmly, talking to the manager. But when the manager intervened, the dad became aggressive, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' behavior. They didn't take responsibility for their child's actions and even mocked the author. The author's decision to involve the manager was to address the potential damage to their work. However, the kid's autism might affect his behavior, and the parents might need to manage that. But the parents' lack of support here was a problem. \n\nThe author did curse back, which isn't ideal, but given the parents' attitude, it might be a reaction to provocation. The kid was ultimately the one who caused the mess, and the parents' negligence led to the incident. So the author's actions were in self-defense and to protect their property. The parents, not the author, are at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
