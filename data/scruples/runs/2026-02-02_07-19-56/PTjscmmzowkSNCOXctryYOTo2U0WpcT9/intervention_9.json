Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic kid thrown out of a coffee shop.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author was at a coffee shop, working, and a family came in. The kid, who might be autistic, unplugged their earphones. The parents didn't seem to be managing the kid well. Then the kid spilled a drink on the author's laptop. The parents didn't apologize, so the author told the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad got angry, the kid was upset, etc.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The kid's actions (unplugging earphones, spilling) are problematic, but the author's response is the key. The parents didn't help, so maybe the author took the right step by involving the manager. However, the kid's autism might make his behavior different. Were the parents aware of his needs? Did they try to manage him? The author says the dad pushed the kid earlier, which might indicate poor parenting. \n\nBut the author's reaction: After the spill, they went to the manager, which is probably reasonable. The manager asked them to leave. The dad's response was aggressive, and the author cursed back. The mom blamed the kid's autism. So the author feels bad about the kid's situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial action of reporting the incident to the manager is probably justified because the kid damaged property. However, the author's reaction of cursing back might not be appropriate. Also, the manager made the final decision, so the author might have followed proper channels. However, considering the kid's autism, maybe the manager should have been more understanding. But the parents' behavior (not apologizing, arguing, pushing) might have contributed to the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted within their right to protect their belongings. On the other hand, perhaps the situation could have been handled better without involving the manager. But the spill was a significant issue. The parents didn't take responsibility, so the author's action was a reaction to that. Still, the kid might not have been at fault entirely, given his autism. The author might have overreacted by getting angry and cursing, but the initial request to leave was through the manager. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they reported a legitimate issue, but their personal reaction (cursing) was bad. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the family being thrown out. The manager did that, so maybe the author isn't directly responsible. But they started the process by telling the manager. \n\nBut if the kid's behavior was due to autism, maybe the manager should have considered that. The author might have misjudged the situation, but the parents' behavior was also poor. It's a bit of a grey area. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author acted to protect their property and followed the correct procedure by involving the manager.\n"
