Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic child thrown out of a coffee shop. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was in a coffee shop, working with earphones. A family entered, and the child, who later is revealed to have autism, interacted with the author's earphones. The parents were arguing about cheating, and the child spilled a drink on the author's laptop. The parent didn't apologize, so the author reported them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The dad reacted angrily, gave the finger, and the author cursed back. The mom criticized the author for targeting an autistic child.\n\nNow, considering the parents' behavior: they left their child unattended, which could be a red flag. The dad shoved the kid, indicating possible neglect or poor parenting. When the child caused a mess, the parents didn't take responsibility, reacting with smugness and laughter. The dad's argument and disrespect towards the author might justify the author's frustration.\n\nHowever, the child has autism, which affects behavior. The parents might be dealing with challenges, but their response was dismissive. The author's actions were a reaction to the parents' lack of accountability, not just the child's actions. But did the author overreact? The child was trying to apologize later, which the dad prevented, suggesting the parents were the main issue.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are responsible for their child's actions. The author reported the incident because the parents didn't address the damages. The manager handled the situation, so the author might not be at fault for seeking resolution. However, the author's decision to involve the manager and the subsequent confrontation could be seen as harsh, especially considering the child's condition.\n\nBut the parents' behavior was inexcusable. They didn't show any remorse. The author's actions were to protect their property and work. The key point is whether the author acted appropriately given the parents' disregard. The author might not be at fault because the parents failed to manage their child's actions and respected the author's belongings.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's autism might require a different approach. The author could have tried to communicate with the parents first, but the parents didn't respond. The manager was involved, which is the proper step. The author's anger and cursing might be a problem, but the initial action of reporting the incident is understandable.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the parents were at fault for their behavior and lack of responsibility. The author's actions were a response to that. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the main responsibility is on the parents. The author acted to protect their property and work, which is reasonable. The manager made the decision to eject the family, so the author isn't solely responsible. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
