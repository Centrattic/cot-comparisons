Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a family with an autistic child thrown out of a coffee shop. The situation involves the author working in a coffee shop when a family enters. The child, who is autistic, unplugs their earphones and spills a drink on their laptop. The parents don't apologize, and the author reports them to the manager, leading to the family being asked to leave. The parents react angrily, and the author curses back. The author later feels bad about the kid but is unsure if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken by both parties. The child's behavior seems to be a result of being autistic, which can involve sensory issues or difficulty understanding social norms. The parents left the child unattended, leading to the earphones being unplugged. The child spilled the drink, and the parents didn't respond appropriately. The author confronted the parents, and the manager intervened. The key points here are the parents' responsibility for their child's actions, the author's right to protect their property, and the public reaction to the situation.\n\nThe parents' behavior is questionable. Leaving a child unattended could be seen as negligent, especially if the child has special needs. The parents didn't address the spills or the child's actions, which exacerbated the situation. The father's sarcastic comment and the mother's defensive reaction might have contributed to the author's frustration. However, the author did involve the manager, which is a reasonable step when dealing with a conflict in a public space.\n\nOn the author's side, they tried to handle the situation calmly at first, asking the child politely and then addressing the parents. When the parents didn't respond, they escalated by involving the manager. The curses and public confrontation might have been unwise, but the initial action of reporting the incident isn't necessarily wrong. The author felt the parents were at fault for not supervising their child and not taking responsibility.\n\nHowever, there's a need to consider the child's needs. Throwing a family out of a public place could impact the child's ability to be in social settings, which is important for their development. The author might have overreacted in the heat of the moment, especially after the parents' dismissive attitude. But given that the parents didn't take responsibility, the author's actions could be seen as justified in protecting their property and work.\n\nThe debate here is between the right to a safe workspace and the need to accommodate individuals with disabilities. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations, but in this case, the parents might not have provided the necessary support for their child, leading to the disturbance. The manager's decision to ask the family to leave might be within their rights if the situation was disruptive. The author's anger and public cursing are problematic, but the core action of involving the manager is a standard response.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's public confrontation was inappropriate, the main action of reporting the incident to the manager is understandable given the parents' inaction. The onus is on the parents to manage their child's behavior in public. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
