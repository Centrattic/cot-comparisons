They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent lying to the girlfriend's parents about allowing their son privacy. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The son is 16, and his girlfriend is also 16. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about how their daughter interacts with the boy, like not being on the bed under covers and checking on them. The author's son is already sexually active, and the author believes in giving him privacy as long as he's using protection.\n\nThe main issue here is the lie the author told. The girlfriend's parents called to arrange a meeting, but the author was at work. Her husband told them that a parent would always be home, but the author actually made plans to leave and have a friend pretend to be present. The author feels conflicted about whether they overstepped by making decisions for someone else's child.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The parents of the girlfriend have their own rules, but they're being overbearing. The author's actions were to protect their son's privacy, which they believe is important. However, they lied to the other parents, which could be seen as dishonest. The question is whether that lie was justified.\n\nLegally, both families have their own rights. The author's son is a minor, so the parents have some responsibility. But the girlfriend's parents are being overly controlling, which might push the author to take a different approach. The author's actions might be seen as protecting their son's autonomy, but they did lie to the other parents, which could strain relationships or put the daughter in a tough spot if the parents find out.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The author believes in their son's privacy and has discussed consent and safety with him. They might feel that the girlfriend's parents are being unreasonable. However, by lying, they didn't respect the other parents' wishes, even if those wishes are controlling. The key here is whether the lie was necessary. The author had good intentions but used deception. Maybe they could have been honest but set boundaries instead.\n\nIn AITA terms, the community often weighs intentions against the impact. Even if the parents are overbearing, lying might be seen as crossing a line. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're advocating for their son's rights, but the deception could be problematic. On the other hand, if the girlfriend's parents are toxic, the author's actions could be seen as protecting their son from an unhealthy environment.\n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. The author's actions were to protect their son, but the method involved deceit. Depending on the perspective, the answer could go either way. However, since the author made decisions about another family's child without their consent, even if well-intentioned, it might tip the scales towards being the asshole. But considering the controlling behavior of the girlfriend's parents, some might argue it's justified. In many AITA threads, lying to parents is often seen as a mistake, but the context here is important. I think the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because they lied to protect their son's privacy despite the other parents' rules, which might not give them the right to make those decisions for another family's child.\n"
