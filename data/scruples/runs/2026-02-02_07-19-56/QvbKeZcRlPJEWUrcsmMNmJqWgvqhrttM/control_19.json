They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the son and girlfriend are both 16, which I think is a minor age in most places. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about chastity and monitoring their daughter. The author's son has been going to her house and there have been changing rules each time.\n\nNow, when the girl comes over to their house for the first time, the mom called the author (who's a correctional officer and wasn't home) and then the dad called the husband. The parents wanted to make sure a parent was home at all times and to monitor them. The husband agreed, but the author didn't follow through. Instead, they told the son they'd give him privacy if he and the girl were using protection. They even arranged for a friend to pretend to be their cousin in case the parents came over.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they trust their son, believe in his agency, and think the girlfriend's parents are overbearing. They feel guilty but stand by their decision. The question is whether lying to the other parents makes the author at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethics here. When parents of their child's partner set expectations, is it okay to lie about following them? The author didn't actually check on them constantly and had a plan to cover their absence. The parents are worried about their daughter's behavior, which is a valid concern, even if their methods are extreme. By lying, the author is deceiving the other parents, which could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author's own child is mature and responsible, withholding the truth from the other parents might interfere with the other family's rules and decisions. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't responsible for the other family's child. They're the parent of their own son, so maybe they have the right to set their own boundaries. However, the parents of their son's girlfriend might feel that the author's actions support their son's inappropriate behavior. The author's son is sexually active, which might not align with the girlfriend's parents' values. The author is enabling their son by lying about monitoring, which could be seen as irresponsible if it puts the girlfriend at risk.\n\nBut the author claims they've talked to their son about consent, protection, etc. So maybe they believe their son is making good decisions. Still, lying to another family's parents about their child's safety could be problematic. The parents have a right to set their own house rules, and the author is circumventing that. Even if the other parents are controlling, lying might not be the right approach. Perhaps the author should have had a conversation with the other parents about their concerns or chosen not to let their son visit the girlfriend's house if they don't agree with the rules. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they are the parent of their son and have their own values. They aren't obligated to follow the other family's rules. But the act of lying is key here. If they agreed to keep an eye on them but didn't, that's a lie. The parents might have trusted the author based on the agreement, so the lie could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is lying to people who are not their own parents but are trying to protect their daughter. Even if the author's intentions are good, the lie undermines the other parents' efforts. The answer might be A (ITA) because they misrepresented their actions to the other parents. But others might say B (not ITA) because parents have different approaches. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the lie seems central. If you lie to people about monitoring their child, that's probably wrong regardless of your own child's maturity.\n"
