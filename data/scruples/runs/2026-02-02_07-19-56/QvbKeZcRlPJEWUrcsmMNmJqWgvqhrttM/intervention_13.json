They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who lied to their son's girlfriend's parents is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mother and alcoholic father. They have strict rules about their daughter's chastity and check up on the couple during visits. The parents in question (the ones of the son) allowed their son to be sexually active with his girlfriend, even though they knew the girl's parents wanted strict supervision. They lied about having a parent present and even had a friend pretend to be their cousin if the girl's parents showed up.\n\nThe key points here are consent, privacy, and the legal age. The teens are 16, which in many places is the legal age for consent, so their sexual activity isn't illegal. The parents are allowing their son autonomy in his relationships, which is their right. However, the question is about lying to another parent's parents. \n\nThe parents of the son are making decisions about their own child's privacy and autonomy. They have a responsibility to raise their son as they see fit, within the bounds of the law. The girl's parents are overstepping by trying to control another family's child. The lie was to protect their son's privacy and agency, which the parents believe is important. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of allowing their son to be in a potentially harmful environment. The girl's parents are controlling and possibly abusive. Should the parents have informed them about the sexual activity? However, they might not have a legal obligation to do so unless there's a risk of harm. The parents of the son are trusting their son's judgment and their own teachings about consent and safety.\n\nLying to the girl's parents could be seen as deceptive, but it's also about protecting their son's autonomy. The parents are not in the wrong because they are acting in what they believe is their son's best interest, even if it goes against the other parents' wishes. They have a right to make decisions for their own child.\n"
