They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves two 16-year-olds who are in a relationship and have been sexually active. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling with strict rules about their daughter's chastity. The author, as a parent, allowed their son and the girlfriend privacy, even going so far as to have a friend pretend to be their cousin if the parents showed up unexpectedly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights versus the teens' autonomy. The author's actions were to protect their son's privacy and agency, which they believe is important. However, the girlfriend's parents have their own rules and expectations, which they might not be aware of the teens' sexual activity. By lying, the author is interfering with the other parents' control over their daughter's life. \n\nThere's a conflict here between the author's parenting style and the girlfriend's parents' control. The author's justification is that they trust their son and have given him education about consent and protection. But the other parents wanted to ensure their daughter's safety and might have different values. The author's deception could be seen as undermining the other parents' authority, even if they believe it's for a good reason.\n\nLegally, the teens are minors, and both sets of parents have some responsibilities. However, the author isn't the legal guardian of the girlfriend, so their decisions shouldn't directly affect the other parents' rights. The key issue is whether the author crossed a boundary by lying to protect their son's privacy at the expense of the other parents' control. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. On one hand, the author is supporting their son's autonomy and trust. On the other, they might be enabling a situation the other parents are unaware of, which could lead to potential risks for the daughter. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of the other parents' wishes, even if they have good intentions.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's deception was justified. While their intentions were to support their son, lying to another parent could be considered inconsiderate or even harmful if it leads to the girlfriend's parents not being informed about their daughter's activities. However, if the girlfriend's parents are already overcontrolling and the teens are making their own decisions, the author might argue they're protecting their son from an oppressive environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were meant to protect their son's privacy and agency, but they did so by deceiving the girlfriend's parents, which could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the deception interferes with the other parents' authority without their consent.\n"
