They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves two 16-year-olds who are dating and have been sexually active. The parents are described as controlling, with strict rules about their daughter's behavior.\n\nThe author allowed the girlfriend to visit their home and even arranged for a friend to cover if the parents came. She didn't inform the parents properly when they wanted to talk and made it seem like they would be supervised when they actually weren't. The parents are portrayed as overbearing, but the question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, 16 is the age of consent, so if both teens are agreeing and using protection, that's legally okay. However, the author is lying to the parents, which could be an issue regardless of the parents' behavior. \n\nEthically, the parents have a right to know about their daughter's activities, even if they're controlling. The author's deception might undermine trust and could potentially put the daughter in a risky situation if something went wrong. Even though the author believes in her son's privacy and autonomy, she's making decisions that affect another family's child without their consent. \n\nThe key point here is the breach of trust with the girlfriend's parents. Even if the parents are problematic, lying about supervision and allowing privacy without their knowledge could be seen as negligent or irresponsible. The author is prioritizing her son's autonomy over the parents' rights as guardians. \n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that the parents are too controlling, so the author might be protecting her son's relationship. But lying to parents about their child's safety and supervision is generally not advisable. The author should have found a way to communicate honestly, perhaps while setting boundaries, rather than lying. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, the act of lying and not being honest with the parents is ethically questionable. The parents have a right to parent their child as they see fit, even if the methods are strict. The author's deception could be seen as overstepping and potentially harmful if there were any negative consequences.\n"
