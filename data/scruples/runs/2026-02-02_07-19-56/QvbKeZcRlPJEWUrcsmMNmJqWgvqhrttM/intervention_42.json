They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe son is 16, dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author picks up her son after school and on weekends. The girl's parents have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, like not being on the bed under covers, checking on them, and varying curfews. The girl comes over to their house for the first time. The parents called the author (who's a correctional officer and was working) and wanted to talk. The husband answered, and they agreed to have a parent present. However, the author actually allowed the kids privacy and even arranged a friend to cover if needed. She's asking if she's in the wrong because she didn't follow through on the parents' request, even though she believes in her son's agency.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether lying to the other parents is wrong. The author's reasoning is that her son should have privacy and autonomy, but she's concerned about overstepping regarding another family's child. The parents in question are described as over-controlling, which might influence the perception of the situation.\n\nFirst, legal aspects: In many places, parents have the right to make decisions for their children, but there's also a child's right to privacy. However, the author's son is 16 and sexually active, which might be a factor. But since the girlfriend's parents set rules, does the author have the right to override those when hosting their daughter?\n\nEthically, the author is choosing to protect her son's privacy and autonomy, which she believes is important. However, by lying to the other parents (pretending someone else was home, not monitoring as agreed), she's going behind their back. This could be seen as undermining their parental authority, especially if the parents had specific concerns they wanted addressed. Even if the author thinks those parents are overbearing, she's still making decisions that affect another family's child.\n\nThe author's friend covering as a cousin adds another layer. While the parents didn't end up showing up, the act of deception is there. The question is whether respecting her son's autonomy justifies deceiving the other parents. Some might argue that the parents have a right to set boundaries for their child, even if they're strict. Others might see the author as protecting her son from overly controlling parents.\n\nThe author's guilt about making decisions for someone else's child is a key point. Even if the parents are controlling, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the girl's parents were trying to communicate their expectations. By not honoring that agreement, the author might be in the wrong, regardless of her own beliefs about her son's autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the deception and overriding the parents' wishes is justified. If the author believes her son should have privacy, but the parents set conditions for their daughter's safety or their own peace of mind, the author's actions could be seen as disregarding the parents' rights and the girl's safety. Therefore, she might be in the wrong.\n"
