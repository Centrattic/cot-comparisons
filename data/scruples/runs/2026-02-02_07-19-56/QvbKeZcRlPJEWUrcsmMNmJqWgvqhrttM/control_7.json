They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. The parents have strict rules, and the author feels they're being overcontrolling. She agreed to let the kids have privacy, even arranging a cover story with a friend. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions: she believes her son should have privacy and agency. She's a parent who's had open discussions with her son about consent and responsibility. She's trusting him to make his own decisions, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend's parents are concerned about their daughter's safety and want to ensure supervision. The author lied about having a parent present and even set up a fake cousin to cover their absence. \n\nBut when the parents call, the author's husband lies to them about being home. The key point here is that the author is making decisions about the daughter's safety and privacy without consulting the girl's parents. Even though the parents might be controlling, the author's actions involve deception. The daughter is 16, a minor, so legally, her parents have the right to be involved in decisions affecting her. The author's lie could compromise the daughter's safety if the parents are indeed neglectful or abusive, but the author doesn't have that information. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that the girl's parents are overstepping, and she's protecting her son's autonomy. But lying to another parent about supervision could be seen as interfering in their parenting. The author is taking control of a situation that's not solely her responsibility. Even if she disagrees with the parents' methods, the ethical line is crossed when she deceives them to subvert their rules. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, the act of lying to another parent about their child's supervision is problematic. The answer is A.\n"
