They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who lied to her son's girlfriend's parents. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the son and his girlfriend's interactions, like not being under the covers, checking on them, and varying curfews.\n\nThe main issue here is that the author lied to the girlfriend's parents. The mom called the author (who's a correctional officer and was working) and wanted to talk to her. The dad then called the husband and wanted to ensure they'd have a parent home at all times and monitor the teens. The author's husband agreed, but in reality, they didn't. The author even arranged for a friend to pretend to be her cousin if the girlfriend's parents showed up. The author is now wondering if she was in the wrong by making that choice regarding someone else's child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's son is 16, as is the girlfriend. The parents of the girlfriend are not the author's, so the author is making decisions about their daughter's safety and privacy. Even if the author believes her son is responsible and has discussed these topics with him, she's deciding on behalf of another parent's child. This could be seen as overstepping because the girlfriend's parents have their own parenting style, which the author disapproves of. However, the girlfriend's parents are portrayed as controlling and possibly harmful, so the author might feel justified in protecting her son's autonomy.\n\nBut the key here is the lie. The author allowed her son to have privacy with the girlfriend while agreeing to the opposite with the girlfriend's parents. The author's husband agreed to the parents' demands, but the author went against that by not enforcing the rules. This could be seen as deceitful. Even if the author believes in the teens' right to privacy, she's deceiving the girlfriend's parents, who have the legal right to make decisions about their own child. By lying, the author is undermining the parents' authority and possibly putting the girlfriend in a position where they might not know what's actually happening.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might be motivated by a desire to protect her son's autonomy and trust him to make responsible decisions. The girlfriend's parents are depicted as overbearing, so the author might think they are being too controlling. However, the fact remains that the author is making a choice that affects another family's child without their consent. Even if the author's intentions are good, the act of lying is a breach of trust with the girlfriend's parents.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. At 16, both teens are minors, so their parents have a legal responsibility to make decisions regarding their safety and well-being. The author's decision to not monitor the interactions and to deceive the girlfriend's parents could be seen as interfering in a way that bypasses the legal guardians' responsibilities. This could lead to potential issues if something were to happen as a result of the lack of supervision.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between respecting one's own child's autonomy and respecting another parent's right to make decisions for their child. The author believes in her son's ability to make responsible choices, but the girlfriend's parents may not. The deception complicates the situation because the author is not being honest with the other parents about her intentions regarding their daughter.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for lying to the girlfriend's parents, even if her intentions were to protect her son's autonomy. The deception undermines the trust and cooperation between families. However, if the girlfriend's parents are indeed harmful or controlling, the author might feel that she's acting in her son's best interest. But the act of lying is a clear ethical breach, regardless of the intentions.\n"
