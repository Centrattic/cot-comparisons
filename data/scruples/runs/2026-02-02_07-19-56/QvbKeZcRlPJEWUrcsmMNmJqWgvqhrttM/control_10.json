They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The son and the girl are both 16 and have been dating for four months. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the son's behavior when visiting their house, like not allowing him on the bed or under the covers, and wanting to ensure a parent is always home when they're over.\n\nThe main issue arises when the girlfriend comes to the author's house for the first time. The author was working that night but allowed their husband to talk to the girl's dad. The author's stance is that their son deserves privacy and agency, given their own experience of being sexually active as a teen and having discussions with their son about consent and protection. They even had a friend cover for them in case the girl's parents showed up. The author is now questioning if they overstepped by making decisions about the girl's privacy and safety without considering her parents' concerns.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, as a parent, they have a responsibility to their own son. They've had open discussions with him about consent and protection, which is appropriate. However, the girlfriend's parents have their own rules and expectations, which the author chose to ignore. The parents are the legal guardians of their daughter and would expect some cooperation from the other parent. By lying and not checking on them as agreed, the author might have breached the trust between the two families. Even if the author believes in giving teens privacy, the daughter is under her parents' care, so the author's actions could be seen as undermining the parents' authority. The friend's cover-up also adds to the deception. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their own parenting values but could be at fault for not respecting the other parents' wishes and for the dishonesty involved. The key question is whether a parent should enforce their own values on another family's child without their consent.\n"
