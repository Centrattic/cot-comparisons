They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother who lied to her son's girlfriend's parents is in the wrong. The situation involves teenagers, parental control, and privacy.\n\nFirst, the parents of the girl are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about their daughter's interactions with the boy. The mother from the question (the son's mom) decides to lie about their intentions to allow privacy for the teens, even arranging a fake cousin to cover for them if the parents showed up. She also withheld the fact that the teens are already sexually active.\n\nThe key points here are: the mother's actions were to protect her son's privacy and agency, but she lied to the girl's parents. The question is whether this lie makes her at fault. \n\nOn one hand, the mother is standing up against what she sees as excessive control from the girl's parents. She's advocating for her son's autonomy, which is a valid concern. Teens do need some independence, and the girl's parents' rules seem overly restrictive and possibly harmful. The mother's intention was to give the teens space, which could be seen as promoting trust and respect.\n\nOn the other hand, lying to another parent about their child's safety and activities could be problematic. The girl's parents have a right to know about their daughter's well-being, even if their parenting style is flawed. By not being honest, the mother might have put the girl in a potentially unsafe situation if the parents had valid concerns (even if they're overbearing). Also, withholding information about the teens being sexually active could prevent the girl's parents from providing necessary guidance or support on health and safety matters.\n\nThe mother's justification is that her son is responsible and they've discussed consent and protection. However, the girl's parents aren't in a position to be informed about these discussions. The mother's actions could be seen as overstepping by making decisions for the girl's parents. Even if her intentions are good, lying undermines trust and could lead to complications if the truth comes out.\n\nConsidering all this, the mother's actions, while well-intentioned, involved deception and possibly compromising the girl's parents' rights to information about their child. The line between protecting a teen's autonomy and respecting another parent's rights is thin here. The mother's lies could be seen as the wrong choice despite her good intentions.\n"
