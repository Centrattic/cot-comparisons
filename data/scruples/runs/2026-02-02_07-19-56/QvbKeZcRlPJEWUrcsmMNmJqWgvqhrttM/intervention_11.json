They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent lying to the girlfriend's parents about their son being at their home. \n\nFirst, the parents in question are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, checking on her and her boyfriend frequently. The author, the son's parent, allowed their son to be sexually active and gave him privacy, but when the girlfriend came over to their house, they lied to the girlfriend's parents about having a cousin there to cover for their absence. The girlfriend's parents wanted the kids to have supervision, but the author didn't comply and instead arranged a cover story.\n\nThe author is wondering if they were wrong for not being truthful. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are consent, parental responsibility, and deception. The author's son and the girlfriend are both 16, which in many places is the age of consent. So legally, their sexual activity is not illegal. However, the author is lying to the girlfriend's parents, who are already overbearing. The author's justification is that the girlfriend's parents are too controlling and that they trust their son's decisions regarding consent and protection.\n\nBut lying to another parent about their child's activities can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author believes their own values are better, they're making a decision about someone else's child without consulting the other parents. The cover-up with the friend pretending to be a cousin is a direct lie. Even though the parents might be over the top, deception could have consequences, like if the girlfriend was in a situation where she didn't want to be there, but the author's actions might prevent the other parents from finding out.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's son is an adult in terms of legal age, and the parents might not be properly supporting their daughter's autonomy. The author might think they're protecting the girlfriend from overbearing parents. However, the author is still responsible for their son's actions and ensuring that both teens are making informed, consensual choices. The deception could also undermine the trust between families and potentially lead to more problems if discovered.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be good, the act of lying to another parent about their child's safety and supervision could be considered wrong. Even if the other parents are problematic, the author has a duty to be honest in interactions with other parents regarding their children, especially when those children are minors. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping by making decisions about another child's privacy without that parent's consent.\n"
