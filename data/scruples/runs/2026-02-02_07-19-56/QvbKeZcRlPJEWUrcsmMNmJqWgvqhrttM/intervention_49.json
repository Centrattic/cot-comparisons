They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a parent whose son is in a relationship with a girl whose parents are described as controlling and have issues like a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The parents have strict rules about the son's visits, checking on them, and changing curfews. The girl comes over for the first time, and the parents wanted to talk to the author, but they couldn't be reached. The husband spoke to the girl's dad and agreed to having a parent present. However, the author actually gave the son privacy, even arranging a friend to cover if needed. The author admits the teens are already sexually active but feels conflicted about whether they should have made that choice for someone else's child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another perspective. The main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their own child's privacy and autonomy, which is a parent's responsibility. They believe in consent and safe sex, so they trust their son's judgment. On the other hand, the girl's parents are concerned about their daughter's safety, and the author might be undermining that by not respecting their wishes, especially since the girl is also a minor. The author is making decisions about another parent's child's safety without consulting them, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut the girl's parents are described as controlling, so the author might feel that their own approach is more reasonable. However, even if the parents are controlling, the author's decision to deceive them by lying about their plans (using a friend as a cover) could be problematic. The parents have a right to be informed about their daughter's safety. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as prioritizing their son's autonomy over the daughter's safety, even though they believe in consent and safe practices. But since both are minors, parents have a duty to protect both children. The author didn't communicate their plans to the girl's parents, even though they knew the parents were concerned. That lack of communication could lead to potential risks for both teens.\n\nSo the key points are: the author lied about their intentions, didn't coordinate with the other parents despite their concerns, and made decisions about the daughter's safety without consulting her parents. Even if the author believes they're right, the act of deception and not respecting the other parents' wishes might make them in the wrong. But the parents of the girl are also controlling and possibly not in the child's best interest, which complicates things.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were justified given the other parents' behavior. However, as a parent, the author should have engaged with the girl's parents instead of lying. Lying is inherently wrong regardless of the context. Even if they disagree with the other parents' rules, they should have found a way to communicate and set boundaries that protect both children. So the author is in the wrong for lying and not being transparent, even if their intentions were to protect their son's autonomy.\n"
