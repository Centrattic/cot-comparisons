They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves two teenagers who are dating, and the mom of the girl (the author) is lying to the boyfriend's parents about their expectations. The parents of the girl are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author's son and the girl are both 16, sexually active, and the author has allowed them a lot of privacy, even arranging for a friend to cover for them if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age here. In most places, 16 is the age of consent, so the teens are legally allowed to be sexually active. The author is supporting her son's autonomy and privacy, which is a valid parental role. However, the question is about lying to the other parents. The parents of the girl (her mom and dad) wanted to talk to the author to set rules about supervision. The author's husband agreed to have a parent present, but the author herself didn't follow through. She also didn't check on the couple and even set up a cover story with a friend. \n\nThe parents of the girl are portrayed as overbearing, so the author might feel that their control is unnecessary. But by lying to the other parents, the author is withholding information and possibly deceiving them. The other parents have their own right to make decisions about their daughter's safety and relationships, even if their parenting style is problematic. The author is making choices that affect another child (the girl) without the girl's parents' knowledge or consent. \n\nEven though the author's intentions might be good\u2014believing in her son's autonomy and privacy\u2014she's not considering the other parents' perspective. The girl's parents are trying to protect their daughter, even if their methods are controlling. By lying, the author could be undermining their efforts and potentially putting the girl at risk if the parents' concerns are valid in some way. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is making a judgment about the other parents' parenting style and using that as a reason to deceive them. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping because she's making decisions that affect another family's child without their input. \n\nHowever, since the girl is a minor, her parents are legally responsible for her. The author's son is also a minor, but he's with the girl in her home, which is under her parents' jurisdiction. The author's deception could interfere with the girl's parents' ability to protect her. Even if the author believes the girl's parents are too controlling, her lying might not be justified because it's about another child's safety and parental rights.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for lying to the other parents and not being honest about their intentions regarding supervision. Even if the parents are controlling, the author's actions involve deception and could have consequences for the girl's safety.\n"
