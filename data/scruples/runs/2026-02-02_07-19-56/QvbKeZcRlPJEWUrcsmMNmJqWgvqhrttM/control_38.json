They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the son and his girlfriend are both 16, which is a legal age in some places. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the son's time with their daughter, changing rules about being in the room, on the bed, etc. The writer's son is allowed to visit the girlfriend's house, and the parents want to ensure they're monitored.\n\nWhen the girlfriend comes over to the writer's house for the first time, the parents call. The writer, a correctional officer, is working, so her husband takes the call. The parents want to ensure their daughter is supervised. The writer's husband agrees, but they don't actually supervise. Instead, the writer lies by arranging a friend to pretend to be a cousin if the parents show up. The parents didn't come, so the lie wasn't needed. The writer is now conflicted about whether they were wrong to make decisions affecting another family's child.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: lying to parents, allowing their son to have privacy with a minor, and the parents' controlling behavior. Legally, the age of consent varies, but in many places, 16 is okay. However, the parents might have legal rights as guardians. The writer's son and the girlfriend are sexually active, which the writer supports with consent education, but the parents might not be aware. The writer's actions involve deception, which is a problem. Even if the parents are overbearing, lying could jeopardize the daughter's safety or legal rights. The writer might be infringing on the parents' authority. There's also the aspect of the friend covering for them, which adds to the deception. The writer's guilt suggests they know something's off. While their intentions are protective, the method is ethically questionable.\n"
