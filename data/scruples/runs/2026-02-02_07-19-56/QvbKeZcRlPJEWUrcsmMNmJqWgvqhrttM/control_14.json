They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the situation.\n\nSo, the author's son is 16 and dating a girl who's also 16. Her parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author picks up the son after school and drives him to the girl's house. The girl's mom has strict rules about their interactions, like not being on the bed or under the covers. The author's son and daughter (the other girl) are already sexually active. \n\nThe key part is when the girl's parents contact the author. The mom called the author (who's a correctional officer and wasn't home), and the dad spoke to the husband. They wanted to ensure a parent was always home and that the author's family would keep an eye on them. The author's husband agreed, but the author actually didn't follow through. They allowed privacy and even had a friend pretend to be family if the girl's parents came over. The author feels guilty about making decisions for someone else's child but thinks the girl's parents are overcontrolling.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is in the wrong. The main ethical issue here is whether the author overstepped by making decisions about another family's child. The girl's parents entrusted their daughter to the author's care, but the author didn't adhere to the agreed-upon terms. Even though the author believes in their son's autonomy, the girl's parents have their own rules and expectations. By lying and not monitoring the interactions as promised, the author potentially put the girl in a situation that the girl's parents didn't agree to. \n\nBut then again, the author argues that the girl's parents are controlling and that their rules are overly restrictive. The author also mentions that the teens are already sexually active, so maybe they think the parents' rules are unnecessary. However, from a legal standpoint, the parents have the authority to set boundaries for their daughter, and the author might have a responsibility to respect those boundaries, even if they disagree. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as interfering with the girl's parents' parenting. Even if the author's intentions were to give their son privacy and autonomy, they didn't consider the implications for the girl and her parents. The lie about having a cousin cover for them is also a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the girl's parents are overbearing and that the teens are capable of making their own decisions. However, since the girl is a minor, her parents have legal authority. The author's decision to not monitor them might have placed the girl in a situation without her parents' consent, which could be problematic if something went wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did make a choice that affected another family's child without their knowledge or consent. Even if they disagree with the girl's parents' approach, the author's responsibility is to comply with the terms that were agreed upon. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
