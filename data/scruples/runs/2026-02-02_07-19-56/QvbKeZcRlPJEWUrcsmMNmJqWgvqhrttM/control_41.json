They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The parents of the girlfriend are controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author's son is 16, as is the girlfriend. They've been dating four months, and the girl's parents have strict rules about their interactions.\n\nThe author's son visits the girlfriend's house, and the parents have these rules changing all the time about what they can do. Then the girl comes over to the author's house for the first time. Her parents called the night before, but the author was working (as a correctional officer) and wasn't home. The husband (the author's spouse) talked to the father. The parents wanted to ensure the author's son and the girl were supervised. The author, however, has a different view: they believe teens should have privacy and agency. They even arranged for a friend to pretend to be their cousin if the girl's parents showed up. The author's guilt comes from possibly overstepping by making decisions for someone else's child.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The parents of the girlfriend are trying to control their daughter's interactions, but the author's approach is to give their son privacy. The author's son and the girlfriend are already sexually active, which the author knows. The author is lying to the girlfriend's parents about supervision.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the girl is 16, which is the age of consent in many places. So the sexual activity might be legal. However, the author's role is as a parent of the son. They have a right to make decisions about their own child's privacy and how they parent. But when it comes to someone else's child, that's more complicated. The author is not the parent of the girlfriend, so they don't have authority over her. However, they are responsible for their own son.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as interfering with the girlfriend's parents' parenting decisions. By allowing their son to be unsupervised with another minor, even if they trust their son, they might be enabling a situation that the other parents find unacceptable. The girlfriend's parents are concerned about their daughter's chastity and want control, which the author disagrees with. But the author's son is engaging in activities that the girl's parents don't want her to do. \n\nThe author's justification is that they believe in their son's privacy and autonomy. But by lying to the girlfriend's parents, they are actively deceiving them. The question is whether this deception is justified. If the author's son is engaging in sexual activity, and the author is aware, they might have a duty to inform the girlfriend's parents if that activity is occurring. However, in some jurisdictions, there might be laws about reporting underage sexual activity if there's a risk of harm, but if both are 16 and it's consensual, it's legal. \n\nThe author's guilt stems from possibly overstepping with someone else's child. Even if they trust their own son, the girlfriend's parents have their own parenting style, and the author's actions could be seen as undermining that. The author is allowing their son to be in a situation that the other parents wanted to avoid, which could lead to the girl being pressured or coerced, even if the author believes their son wouldn't do that. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's parents are controlling and possibly abusive (alcoholic father, narcissistic mother), which might make their parenting questionable. The author might feel that their approach is more supportive of the teens' autonomy. However, the author is still making decisions that affect someone else's child without their consent. Even if the author's intentions are good, the act of lying and manipulating the situation could be seen as wrong because it's not their decision to make about the girlfriend's privacy.\n\nSo considering all this, the author is in a dilemma. They might not be legally wrong since the activities are between two minors of legal age, but ethically, they might be at fault for deceiving the girlfriend's parents and possibly exposing the girl to a situation her parents want to prevent. The author's actions could be seen as disregarding the parents' wishes and potentially harming the girlfriend by not respecting her family's boundaries. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
