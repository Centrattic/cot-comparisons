They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who lied to their son's girlfriend's parents is in the wrong. The parent is a correctional officer, and the son is 16, dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The parents set strict rules for the son when he visits their daughter. The girlfriend came over, and the parents wanted to ensure the parent (the questioner) would supervise. The parent, however, didn't follow through and even had a friend lie if the other parents called. They also gave their son privacy for sexual activity, which they had discussed before.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, parental responsibility, and the age of the kids. Both teens are 16, which is legal for consensual activity in many places. The parent's actions were to protect their son's privacy and autonomy, but they lied to the girlfriend's parents, who are already overcontrolling. The friend covering for them adds another layer of deception.\n\nIs the parent wrong for lying? Well, lying is generally considered unethical. However, the parent's intention was to allow their son agency. But the deception was toward other parents who have their own kids. The parent didn't consider the other parents' rights to know about their daughter's activities. Even if the parent believes their own values are better, they crossed a line by lying. The fact that the teens are sexually active is a red flag; while it's legal, the parent's role is to guide, not enable. Also, having a friend lie could be seen as manipulative. The parent might have overstepped by not being honest with the other parents, even if they disagree with the controlling behavior. So, while the parent's intentions might be good, the actions (lying and deception) are problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
