They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents.\n\nFirst, the situation: the son is 16, dating a girl whose parents are controlling and have strict rules. The parents contact the author (the mom) and her husband, asking that they supervise their daughter when she visits. The author's husband agrees, but the author actually plans to give the kids privacy, even arranging a friend to cover if needed. The daughter's parents end up picking her up, and the author is now wondering if she was wrong to deceive them.\n\nSo, the key points here. The parents of the girlfriend want to control the interaction, but the author feels they are overstepping. She lies to them by agreeing to supervise but intends to give the kids space. She even sets up a cover story with a friend. The question is about her actions.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict here. On one hand, the author's son is a minor, and she's his parent. She has the right to make decisions about his upbringing, including how he manages his relationships. She's been open with her son about consent and safety, which is responsible. However, by lying to the other parents, she's not being honest with them. The other parents are the legal guardians of their daughter, so they have a right to know the conditions under which their child is being cared for. The author's deception could be seen as undermining their parental authority, even if she believes their approach is too strict.\n\nBut then, the parents in question are described as controlling and possibly harmful (narcissistic mom, alcoholic dad). The author might feel that their control is overbearing and not in the best interest of the kids. However, as a parent of one of the kids, she has a duty to respect the other parents' wishes, even if she disagrees. The lie could be seen as a breach of that duty. However, if the other parents are harmful, maybe the author is trying to protect her son and the girlfriend from their control.\n\nBut legally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions for their own children, but when it comes to other people's children, they need to respect the other parents' wishes unless there's a clear danger. In this case, the author isn't reporting any danger, just strict rules. So by lying, she's going against the other parents' wishes, which could be seen as wrong. However, she's also advocating for her son's autonomy and privacy, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nThe author's actions might be morally justifiable in her eyes, but ethically, she may be in the wrong because she didn't communicate honestly with the other parents. Deception is generally frowned upon, even if the intentions are good. The other parents might feel betrayed or at risk if their daughter isn't being supervised as they wished. The author's guilt might come from this conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because she lied to the other parents, even if her intentions were to protect her son's autonomy. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the other parents are harmful and she's protecting her son. But since the other parents are legal guardians, the author's deception is the issue. So probably A."
