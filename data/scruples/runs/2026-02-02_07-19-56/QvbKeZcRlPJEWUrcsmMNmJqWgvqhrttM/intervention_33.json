They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves their son, who's 16, dating a girl also 16. The girl's parents are described as controlling and have strict rules. The key issue here is that the parents of the son lied to the girl's parents about their intentions regarding privacy and supervision when the girl came over to their house.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girl's parents wanted to ensure their daughter's chastity and had specific rules. The author's son and his girlfriend are already sexually active. The author's response to the parents' demands was to secretly arrange for a friend to pretend to be a cousin if the parents showed up, even though they didn't end up needing it. The parents also told the husband that they would give the teens privacy as long as they used protection, which contradicted the promise to supervise constantly.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have the right to control their own children's activities, but when it comes to someone else's child, the situation is different. The author's actions could be seen as interfering with the girl's parents' decisions and potentially exposing their daughter to risks that her parents are not aware of. Even though the author might believe in the teens' autonomy, they are not the legal guardians of the girl. The fact that the teens are sexually active is a separate issue, but the author's deception to the girl's parents could be a problem. \n\nHowever, the girl's parents are described as controlling and possibly overbearing, which the author might see as harmful. The author's intention was to give their son and his partner more privacy, which is a form of autonomy the teens might desire. But lying to the girl's parents about supervision could be considered a breach of trust, even if the parents are difficult to deal with. \n\nLegally, if the parents are fulfilling their duty to their own child, then the author's actions might not have legal repercussions, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author is making decisions about another child's well-being without consulting the girl's parents, which could be seen as overstepping. The author's justification is that the girl's parents are too controlling, but that doesn't necessarily give them the right to deceive those parents.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author did lie about supervision and potentially put the girl in a situation her parents didn't agree to. Even if the author's intentions were to respect their son's autonomy, they didn't have the authority to make those decisions for someone else's child. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
