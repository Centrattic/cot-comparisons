They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The parents are described as controlling and have strict rules about the relationship. The author, despite agreeing to the parents' request to monitor the kids, actually allowed them privacy and even set up a cover story with a friend.\n\nFirst, the parents' control issues are problematic. They're imposing strict rules on a teenage relationship, which can be harmful. The author's son is 16, an age where they're exploring relationships, and the author believes in giving them autonomy. However, the key issue here is the deception. The parents were under the impression that the author would be monitoring the interactions, but in reality, the author allowed privacy and even had a friend lie if needed. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as undermining the parents' authority, especially since they had a discussion where the parents wanted to ensure their daughter's safety and the author's husband agreed. The author's justification is that the parents are overbearing and that teens are going to be teens. But the deception here is about lying to the parents, not the son. The author is making a decision for another parent's child, which could have consequences if the girl was pressured or if there were safety issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's son is responsible, and they've had open conversations about consent and protection. The parents in question are portrayed as controlling, which might mean their rules aren't in the best interest of the daughter. However, the act of lying to other parents, even if they're flawed, is still a breach of trust. The author is prioritizing their son's autonomy and privacy over respecting the other parents' wishes, which could be seen as wrong regardless of the parents' shortcomings.\n\nSo, the author's actions involve deception and making a decision that affects another parent's child without their knowledge. While the parents' control is questionable, the act of lying is still ethically problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
