They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person asking the question) is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents.\n\nFirst, the situation: The son and girlfriend are both 16, and their parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The parents have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, checking up on the couple. The author's son goes to the girlfriend's house, but the parents now come to their house. The author's spouse and they lie to the parents about their intentions, even getting a friend to pretend to be a cousin to cover if the parents show up. The author believes their son should have privacy and that the parents are too controlling.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions. They lied to the girlfriend's parents, which is the central issue. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nThe parents of the girlfriend are clearly overbearing, but the author is making decisions about another family's child. Even if the author has good intentions, lying to another parent about their child's activities could be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend's parents have a right to some level of oversight, given that she's a minor. However, the author's actions might have compromised that. Additionally, the author's son and the girlfriend are sexually active, which adds another layer of complexity. The author might believe they're protecting their son's autonomy, but they're also involving another parent's child in that decision without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's parents are problematic, and the author might feel they need to shield their son from overcontrol. But lying to parents, even if they're difficult, could be considered unethical because it undermines the parents' authority. Also, the friend acting as a cover could be risky if discovered, though it wasn't needed here.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They have their son's best interests in mind, but their actions involve deception towards another family. The guilt they feel suggests they're aware of the ethical dilemma. The answer hinges on whether making decisions for another parent's child, even with good intentions, is justified. In most cases, parents have the right to make decisions for their own children, and interfering with that through lies would be considered wrong, regardless of the other parents' behavior.\n"
