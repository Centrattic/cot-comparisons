They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents in question are the girlfriend's parents. They're described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about when the boyfriend can be in the girl's room, what he can do there, and curfews. The author, as the mother of the son, allowed the girl to come over and didn't enforce the parents' rules, even going as far as to have a friend cover for them if needed. The parents wanted to ensure a parent was always home and that the kids were monitored, but the author's family didn't do that. The author also mentions that her son and the girl are already sexually active, which is why she allowed privacy.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the author's actions. She lied to the girl's parents by agreeing to their demands but didn't follow through. The parents wanted strict supervision, but the author allowed her son privacy. The author's reasoning is that her son should have agency and that the girl's parents are overcontrolling. However, the author is questioning if she was wrong for making decisions about someone else's child.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions for their own children, but when it comes to another family's child, it's more complicated. The author isn't the girl's parent, so she doesn't have legal authority over her. The girl's parents, despite their flaws, have the legal right to set boundaries for their daughter. By allowing the girl to be in a situation that the girl's parents disapproved of, the author is going against the parents' wishes. Even if the author believes the parents are too strict, it's not her place to override their decisions. Additionally, the author's actions could put the girl in a vulnerable position, especially if the girl isn't fully aware of the risks involved. There's also the aspect of consent and the girl's own autonomy. The author might think she's protecting her son, but she's also not considering the girl's parents' rights and the potential consequences for the girl. So, even if the author's intentions are good, she's in the wrong for not respecting the other parents' wishes regarding their daughter.\n"
