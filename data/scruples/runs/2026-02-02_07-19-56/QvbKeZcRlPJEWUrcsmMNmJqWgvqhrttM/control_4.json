They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's son is 16 and dating a girl. Her parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The parents have strict rules about when the son can visit and what he can do at their house. Now, the girl comes over to the author's house for the first time. The parents called to talk to the author, but she was working. Her husband talked to the dad, and they agreed to have a parent present at all times. But the author didn't actually follow through. She told the son he could have privacy as long as they used protection. Plus, she asked a friend to pretend to be her cousin in case the girl's parents showed up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down. The main issue seems to be about consent and the right to privacy. The author believes her son should have agency over his own body and that the girl's parents are being overly controlling. The author and her husband made a deal with the girl's parents to supervise, but they didn't. The girl's parents might feel betrayed, thinking they had an agreement that wasn't honored.\n\nBut also, the girl is 16 and already sexually active. The author's actions might be seen as protecting her son's autonomy, but they also involve lying to the girl's parents. The parents of the girl have their own problems, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's deception. If the author agreed to supervise, then not doing so could be a breach of trust. However, if the author's intention was to respect her son's privacy and the girl's parents are overstepping, there's a different perspective. \n\nBut the key point is the lie. The author lied to the girl's parents by making them think there would be supervision and then not providing it. Even if the parents are problematic, lying is generally wrong. The author's actions could put the girl in a situation she's not ready for, even if the parents are controlling. However, the girl is an adult herself in terms of age, so she might have her own agency. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's son is also 16, and the parents of the girl might have legal rights as a parent, but since it's their daughter visiting another home, maybe the host's parents have a responsibility. The author might be in the wrong because she lied to the girl's parents, even if she had her own reasons. The deception is the main issue here. So, the answer might lean towards Yes (A), but there's a counterpoint about the parents' control issues. However, lying is usually considered wrong regardless of the context. So, probably A.\n"
