They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent whose son is dating a girl. The girl's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about how the author's son interacts with their daughter. The parents want to control when the son can be there and check on them. The author's son brings the girl over to their house for the first time. The girl's parents call the author (who's a correctional officer and wasn't home) and speak to her husband. They wanted to ensure a parent is home all the time and that they watch the kids constantly. The author, however, believes in giving her son privacy and autonomy. She even arranged for a friend to pretend to be a cousin if the girl's parents showed up, but it wasn't needed.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because she supports her son's privacy but isn't sure if she overstepped by not complying with the girl's parents' wishes. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. In many places, 16 is the age of consent, so the teens being sexually active isn't illegal. The parents have a right to set rules for their daughter, but they also have a responsibility to consider the other parent's rights. However, the author's actions involved lying (the friend pretending to be a cousin) and not following the agreed-upon terms her husband had with the girl's dad. That could be a problem if there was an agreement between the parents.\n\nEthically, the author believes in her son's privacy and autonomy, which is a valid stance. However, by not informing the girl's parents about her son's sexual activity and by lying about their presence, she might be enabling the teens in a way that could put their health or safety at risk. Also, the deception could be seen as undermining the trust between the parents.\n\nBut the girl's parents are described as overbearing and controlling. The author might feel that their extreme control is harmful and that she's trying to protect her son's agency. However, she's still a parent of one of the teens involved, and her actions could affect the girl's well-being, especially if there are risks involved in their sexual activity that the parents are trying to prevent.\n\nThere's also the issue of the husband agreeing to the girl's parents' terms. The author didn't follow through on that agreement, which could lead to tension within the family. The deception (the friend covering) might have been unnecessary if the parents had communicated openly, but she chose to lie instead of being honest about her intentions.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to protect her son's autonomy and privacy, her actions involve deception and potentially ignoring the other parents' concerns. This could be seen as inconsiderate of the other parents' rights and possibly risky for both teens. So, I think the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she lied and didn't honor the agreement her husband made, even if her motivations were good. However, there's nuance because the other parents' behavior is problematic. But actions like deception and lying are generally wrong regardless of the context.\n"
