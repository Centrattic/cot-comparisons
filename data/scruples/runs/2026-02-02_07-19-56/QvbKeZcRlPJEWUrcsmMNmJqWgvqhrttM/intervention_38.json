They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The parents allowed their son to be over at the girlfriend's house with certain rules, but when the girlfriend came over, they lied about their plans to give her privacy.\n\nFirst, the parents' actions: They told the girlfriend's parents they would keep an eye on them, but in reality, they allowed privacy. They even got a friend to cover for them if the other parents showed up. The parents' motivation seems to be a belief in their son's autonomy and privacy, especially given the controlling nature of the girlfriend's parents. However, they withheld the truth from the girlfriend's parents, which is the crux of the issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, but they are still the legal guardians. As such, they have a right to know about their daughter's activities and visitors, even if their parenting style is problematic. The author's justification is that they trust their son and believe in his agency, but that doesn't negate the other parents' rights. By lying, they undermined the consent and trust the other parents might have given for their daughter to visit. \n\nEven if the author disagrees with the controlling rules, the decision to deceive the other parents is ethically questionable. The author's actions could put both teens in a risky situation if their plans went awry, and it's a breach of the implied trust between families. While the parents might have good intentions, the act of lying crossed a line.\n"
