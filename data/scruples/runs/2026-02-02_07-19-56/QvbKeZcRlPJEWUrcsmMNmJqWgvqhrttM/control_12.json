They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who lied to the girlfriend's parents is in the wrong. The scenario is that the parent (the author) allowed their 16-year-old son and his girlfriend to be alone together, even though the girlfriend's parents are very controlling. The author lied to the girlfriend's parents by having a friend pretend to be a cousin to cover for them when they went out, even though the parents wanted to ensure someone was home at all times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The son and daughter are both 16 and already sexually active. The author's stance is about respecting their privacy and agency. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with strict rules that change. The author felt that the parents were overstepping and wanted to protect their son's autonomy, even if it meant lying to the other parents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, in many places, 16 is the age of consent, so the sexual activity might be legal. However, the parent's actions involved deception. Lying to another set of parents about their child's safety and supervision could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the parent believes the other parents are overbearing. \n\nEthically, this is trickier. The author is prioritizing their son's autonomy and trust, which is a valid concern. However, the deception aspect\u2014having a friend lie about being present\u2014could be problematic. If the girlfriend's parents are concerned about their daughter's safety, lying to them might prevent them from addressing legitimate worries. The author is assuming that their approach is better, but the girlfriend's parents have a right to know about their child's safety, even if they are strict.\n\nAlso, while the author is confident in their son's judgment, the girlfriend's parents might not have the same level of trust. The author's actions could be seen as interfering with the other parents' parental rights. Even if the parents are controlling, the author has a responsibility to communicate honestly rather than deceive.\n\nIn terms of potential consequences, if the deception were discovered, it might lead to conflict between the families. Moreover, if something were to happen to the girlfriend, the author's decision to lie could complicate matters legally and ethically. However, the author's intent was to give the teens privacy, which is a valid concern given their age and maturity.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the parent might not be in the wrong if their intention was to protect their son's autonomy and they believed the other parents were too restrictive. However, the act of lying introduces an ethical issue. Trust between parents and other parents is important, and deception can damage that. The author might have handled it differently, like discussing concerns openly with the other parents instead of lying. Therefore, while the motivation is understandable, the method (lying) could be seen as wrong.\n"
