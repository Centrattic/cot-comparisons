They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the son being at their house, checking in on them, and changing rules frequently.\n\nThe author, a correctional officer, was working when the girlfriend's mom called. The husband talked to the dad. The parents wanted to ensure a parent was home at all times and that they'd keep an eye on the kids. The author's response, however, was to allow privacy if the girl was willing and using protection. They even got a friend to lie if the parents came over.\n\nSo, the author is being asked if they're at fault here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to assess if there's a legal or ethical issue. The kids are 16, which is the age of consent in many places. The author's son is engaging in consensual activity, which is legal. The author is supporting their son's privacy and autonomy, which is a parent's right. However, the girlfriend's parents might have different rules. The author didn't inform the girl's parents about the actual situation, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut considering the girl's parents are portrayed as controlling and possibly not in a good mental state (alcoholic dad, narcissistic mom), the author might feel that the parents aren't acting in the girl's best interest. The author's actions could be seen as protecting their son's privacy and autonomy, which they have the right to do for their child. However, they did lie to the girl's parents, which could be problematic if it endangers the girl or if there's a legal aspect. \n\nBut since the author's son is 16 and the activities are consensual, it's likely legal. The author's friend lied as a cover, but it wasn't needed. The key here is whether the author overstepped by making decisions about another parent's child. Even though the girl is involved, the author's actions were focused on their son's autonomy. However, lying to other parents about their child's safety could be an issue. But given the context, the author might believe the girl's parents are not capable of handling the situation appropriately. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents have the right to make decisions for their own children, but when it comes to another parent's child, it's more complex. The author didn't consult the girl's parents and made decisions that affect her as well. However, the girl is 16 and capable of making her own choices, so the author's actions might be seen as protecting their son rather than overstepping. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions stem from protecting their son and trusting his judgment, which they have the right to do. The girl's parents' control freak behavior is problematic, so the author's decision might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
