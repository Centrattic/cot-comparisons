They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Her parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the boy when he's at their house, like not being on the bed or under the covers. The parents also set varying curfews. The girl comes over to the user's house for the first time. The girl's mom called the user (who's a correctional officer and wasn't home) and wanted to talk to her. The son suggested the husband talk, but the mom wanted to talk to the user. Later, the dad called the husband. The user's husband agreed to some terms, thinking they wanted to make sure a parent was home and they'd watch the kids. But the user actually didn't care, had already allowed the kids to be private as long as they used protection, and even had a friend pretend to be a cousin to cover if the girl's parents came. The parents did show up and picked her up.\n\nThe user is wondering if they're in the wrong for lying. They feel guilty but think the girl's parents are over the top.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user is in the wrong for lying to the girl's parents about their supervision. The user allowed their son and the girl to be intimate while lying to the girl's parents who wanted strict monitoring. The user's justification is that they trust their son, have had open talks, and the girl's parents are controlling. But is lying to another parent about their child's supervision acceptable?\n\nFrom a legal perspective, in many places, if a parent allows a minor to engage in sexual activity, there could be laws involved, especially if it's under a certain age. But the user says the teens are already sexually active, and they're supporting their son's autonomy. However, the user lied to the other parents about their level of supervision. The parents might have wanted to prevent the sexual activity, so the user's deception could be seen as undermining the girl's parents' wishes. Even if the user thinks the parents are controlling, they still have legal rights as parents. The user's actions might be considered a breach of trust or even a legal issue depending on local laws regarding minors and consent. \n\nAlso, the user had a friend lie to the girl's parents, which is a direct deception. Even if the user's intentions were to protect their son's privacy and autonomy, lying to another parent about their child's activities is a gray area. The user is making a decision that affects another family, not just their own. So, while the user's actions come from a place of trust in their son, the deception towards another parent might make them at least partially at fault. The key points are consent (if the girl is of age), the user's right to make decisions for their son, and the ethical implications of lying to another parent.\n"
