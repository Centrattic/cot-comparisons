They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author lying to the girlfriend's parents. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parents in question have a history of controlling, narcissistic behavior, and an alcoholic father. The son is 16 and dating the girl. The author's son is allowed to visit the girl's house, and the author picks him up. The girl's parents are strict with rules about chastity, checking on them, etc. Now the girl comes over to their house for the first time. The girl's parents call to talk to the author, who is a correctional officer working that night. The husband talks to the father, agreeing to have a parent present. However, the author actually lets them have privacy and even arranges a friend to cover if the parents come. The author feels guilty but thinks the girl's parents are over the top.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents are making decisions about another child's safety and well-being. The author's son is of age where he's sexually active, but the girl's parents are concerned about her safety. The author is deceiving the girlfriend's parents about their supervision. While the author believes in their son's autonomy, they're also making decisions without considering the other parent's concerns. Even if the author's intentions are good, deception in such matters can be problematic, especially when it involves another child's safety. However, the girl's parents are described as controlling, which might make the author feel they need to protect their son's privacy. \n\nBut the key issue is whether the author should have made that choice regarding the girl's privacy. The author had no authority over the girl's parents' decisions. By lying, they are undermining the girl's parents' parental rights, even if those parents are flawed. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping and not respecting the other parents' wishes. Even if the author trusts their son, the girl's safety is also a concern. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate honestly and instead chose to deceive, which could lead to potential risks for the girl. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to provide privacy and autonomy for their son and his girlfriend. But the method of deception is questionable. So, considering both sides, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they lied to another parent about supervision, which could affect the other child's safety and trust. However, there's nuance here with the parents' own behavior being problematic. But the act of deception itself is a key point here.\n"
