They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a parent whose son is dating a 16-year-old girl. The girl's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The parents have strict rules about the son when he's at their house, like not being on the bed or under the covers, and checking in on them. The user's son and the girl are already sexually active. \n\nThe main issue here is that the girl's parents called the user the night before she came over to their house. The user was at work, so her husband spoke to the girl's dad. The parents wanted to ensure that a parent would be home at all times and that the user's family would monitor the teens constantly. The user and her husband actually went out for a few hours, and they asked a friend to pretend to be a cousin in case the girl's parents showed up. The friend didn't have to act because the girl was picked up by her dad eventually.\n\nThe user is questioning if they were wrong for lying to the girl's parents. They believe their son deserves privacy and agency, and they think the girl's parents are overly controlling.\n\nSo, the question is: is the user in the wrong for lying? Answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, 16 is the age of consent in many states, so the teens' sexual activity is legally okay. However, the parents are trying to exert control. The user is lying to the girl's parents about their supervision, which could be seen as deceptive. \n\nBut the user is also the parent of the son, so they have the right to make decisions about their own child's upbringing. They have discussed consent, safety, and protection with their son. The user's actions were to protect their son's privacy and autonomy, which they see as important. \n\nHowever, by lying to the other parents, they might be violating the trust of the other parents and possibly endangering the girl, but the user believes the girl's parents are over-controlling. It's a balancing act between respecting another family's wishes and protecting one's own child's autonomy.\n\nIs the user wrong? It's a bit of a moral dilemma. On one hand, the parents have a right to set boundaries for their own child. On the other, the user is lying, which is deceitful. But the user is acting in their son's best interest, considering their own values and the legal age of consent. The other parents' issues with control are their own problem, but the user's deception could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nIn some perspectives, parents have the right to make decisions for their own children, including privacy. However, lying to another parent's face, even if they're problematic, might be considered wrong because it's dishonest. The user's actions could also be seen as undermining the other parents' authority, which might not be their place.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the user's actions are justified despite the deceit. If the user is protecting their son's rights and the other parents are overbearing, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But the act of lying is inherently problematic. The user might be in the right in terms of their own parenting choices but in the wrong for lying. However, since the user is the one asking if they're in the wrong, the community's response might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they were protecting their son and the other parents were overbearing. But there's a gray area here. \n\nI think the answer is B. The user is not in the wrong because they're a parent acting in their son's best interest, even if it involves lying to another parent. The other parents' controlling behavior is a factor that justifies the user's actions.\n"
