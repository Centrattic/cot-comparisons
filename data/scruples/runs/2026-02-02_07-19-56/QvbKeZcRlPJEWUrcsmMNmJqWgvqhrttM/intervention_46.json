They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves two 16-year-olds who are in a relationship and have already been sexually active. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the boy's behavior when he's at their house.\n\nThe key issue here is the parent's decision to lie to the girl's parents about their supervision. The parents wanted to ensure that at least one parent would be home and that they'd monitor the teens constantly. The author, however, agreed to this in front of her husband but actually allowed the teens privacy when they were home, even going as far as arranging for a friend to pretend to be a cousin if the girl's parents showed up.\n\nNow, the author justifies this by saying that her son is responsible and they've discussed consent and safety. The girl's parents are portrayed as overbearing, and the author believes they're being too controlling. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being truthful about supervision.\n\nFirst, legally, in many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their own child's upbringing, but when it comes to another child, there might be ethical considerations. The author is essentially making choices that affect the girl's safety, which the girl's parents are concerned about. Even though the author believes the girl's parents are overbearing, she's still responsible for both children when they're under her supervision.\n\nEthically, the parent lied to someone else's parents about their supervision plan. Even if the author's intentions were good, lying can be seen as a breach of trust. The parents who called were doing so to protect their daughter, and the author's deception could put the girl in a potentially risky situation. The fact that the teens are already sexually active adds another layer, as the parents might not be aware of that risk.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that the girl's parents are not providing a safe environment, and she's trying to protect her son's privacy and autonomy. There's a tension between respecting parental rights and ensuring the safety of another child. The author might argue that the girl's parents are neglecting their responsibility by being too controlling, so she's stepping in to allow their relationship to develop naturally.\n\nBut legally and ethically, the author is responsible for her own child and should not be making decisions about another child's safety without the parents' consent. Even if the girl's parents' methods are questionable, the author's deception could be seen as overstepping her role. The arrangement with the friend to cover their absence further complicates things, as it's a direct lie to the other parents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, her actions involved deception and could compromise the safety of the girl. The parents have a right to make decisions about their daughter's supervision, and the author's interference without their knowledge is ethically problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
