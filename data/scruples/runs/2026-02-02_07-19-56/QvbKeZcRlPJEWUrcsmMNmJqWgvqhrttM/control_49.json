They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent lying to the girlfriend's parents to give their son and his girlfriend privacy. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the couple's interactions, and when the girlfriend comes over, the parents call the author and her husband to set up conditions for supervision.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they believe their son should have privacy and autonomy, especially since they've already had talks about consent and safety. The couple is already sexually active, and the author is okay with it as long as they're using protection. To avoid constant supervision, the author had a friend pretend to be a cousin if the girlfriend's parents showed up, but it wasn't necessary because the dad picked his daughter up in the end.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is the parent of the son, so their responsibility is to their own child. The girlfriend's parents have their own rules, but the author isn't their parent. The key issues here are lying to the girlfriend's parents and enabling the couple to have privacy despite the parents' wishes.\n\nFirst, the author made a choice based on their values and their relationship with their son. They feel that the girlfriend's parents are overbearing, so they decided to protect their son's autonomy. However, by lying to the girlfriend's parents, they might be undermining the parents' authority. But the author isn't the legal guardian of the girlfriend, so they might not have the right to make decisions for her. Even if the author believes the girlfriend's parents are controlling, that doesn't mean they can override the parents' wishes. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in another family's parenting decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is acting in the best interest of their own child. They trust their son's judgment and have educated him about consent and safety. The girlfriend's parents are portrayed negatively, which might justify the author's actions in their eyes. The lie was to maintain their own child's privacy and autonomy, which the author values.\n\nBut the ethical dilemma is whether lying to another family's parents is acceptable. Even if the author's intentions are good, deception can have consequences. The girlfriend's parents might feel betrayed if they find out, and it could strain the relationship between the families. Also, the author's actions could potentially put the girlfriend in a situation where she's not fully informed or protected, depending on the parents' rules being in place for safety reasons, even if they are controlling.\n\nHowever, the author isn't directly harming the girlfriend; they're enabling their son to have privacy. The girlfriend is also a minor, so the author isn't supposed to have authority over her. But the author isn't the one controlling her; they're just allowing their son to interact with her in their home. The main issue is the lie to the girlfriend's parents. Since the parents are the ones who have the legal right to set rules for their daughter, the author's deception could be seen as going against that, even if the parents are problematic.\n\nBut the author isn't the one enforcing the parents' rules; they're choosing to ignore them. The author's justification is that the parents are overstepping, so they're not in the wrong for not complying. However, lying to them is a separate issue. The author could have been honest and respectfully disagreed but chose to lie instead. That might be where the ethical line is crossed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are in the best interest of their son but involve deception towards another family. Depending on cultural or legal standards, this could be seen as wrong. Since the parents are the legal guardians, the author's lie could be considered a breach of trust or respect. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the deception, even if the intentions are good.\n"
