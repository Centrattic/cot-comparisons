They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is the one who lied to the girlfriend's parents about monitoring their kids. The parents in question are described as controlling and overbearing, especially with rules about chastity and constant supervision. The author's son and the girl are already sexually active, so the parents' rules are being ignored in reality.\n\nThe author's main argument is that their son deserves privacy and autonomy, and they feel the girlfriend's parents are too controlling. They even had a friend lie if the girl's parents called. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying to the other parents.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their son's privacy and autonomy, which is a valid concern, especially given the daughter is 16 and in a relationship. Parents have the right to set boundaries for their own children, but when it comes to another family's child, it's more complicated. The author made a choice to deceive the girl's parents, which could be seen as undermining their authority. However, the girl's parents' approach seems extreme and potentially harmful, focusing on chastity and constant surveillance, which might not be healthy for the teens.\n\nBut lying to another parent about supervision is a serious action. Even if the author's intentions are good, the act of deception could have consequences. If the girl's parents were genuinely concerned about her safety, the author's actions might have left her vulnerable. However, given the parents' controlling nature, maybe the author felt it was necessary to protect their son from excessive scrutiny.\n\nThe key points are: the author's son is an adult in terms of age (16), the parents' rules are restrictive and possibly oppressive, and the author is advocating for privacy and agency. The deception was a means to an end, but it still involves lying to another parent. The ethical dilemma here is balancing respect for another parent's authority with protecting one's own child's autonomy.\n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to set rules for their own children's activities in their home. However, when it's about another family's child, the line becomes less clear. The author might be in the wrong because they lied to the girl's parents, but their motivation was to protect their son from what they perceive as harmful control. It's a tough call because both sides have points. The parents' controlling behavior is problematic, but the author's deception could be seen as a breach of trust.\n"
