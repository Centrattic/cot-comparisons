They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who lied to their son's girlfriend's parents is in the wrong. The situation involves teenagers, parental control, and the parent's response to the girlfriend's overbearing parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The son is 16, as is his girlfriend. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the couple's interactions. The parent (the questioner) was approached by the girlfriend's parents to agree to supervise the couple, but instead, they allowed their son more privacy and even had a friend cover for them if needed.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that their son is responsible and has been educated about consent and protection. They believe the girlfriend's parents are overreacting. However, they lied to the other parents about their supervision plans.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether the parent was wrong to deceive the girlfriend's parents. On one hand, the parent is advocating for their son's autonomy and privacy, which is a valid concern. Teenagers do need some independence and trust. On the other hand, the parent is making decisions that affect another family's child. The girlfriend's parents are concerned about their daughter's safety, which is understandable given their own behaviors (controlling, alcoholism). But the parent in question is hiding the truth about supervision, which could put the girlfriend at risk if something goes wrong.\n\nThe parent might argue that the girlfriend's parents are not trustworthy, but lying to them complicates things. Even if the parent believes their son is responsible, the deception could lead to unintended consequences. For example, if the girlfriend was harmed or felt uncomfortable, the parent's lack of supervision could be a problem. Also, there's the issue of respecting the other parents' wishes, even if they are overbearing. The parent is essentially overriding those wishes, which might not be their right to do.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's parents might not be the best guardians, but that doesn't mean the other parent should take over their role. The parent should communicate their stance honestly rather than lie. Lying undermines trust and could lead to legal or safety issues if the situation escalates.\n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong for lying and not respecting the other parents' wishes, even if they disagree with those parents' methods. They could have expressed their concerns openly instead of deceitfully. The line between protecting their son's autonomy and respecting another family's rights is crossed here by the act of deception.\n"
