They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author lying to their son's girlfriend's parents about their intentions regarding privacy and monitoring. \n\nSo, the parents in question (the author's) have a 16-year-old son who's dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mother and an alcoholic father. The girl's parents wanted to ensure that if their daughter came to the author's house, there would be a parent present at all times and constant supervision. The author's husband agreed to this. However, the author's actual plan was to give the teens as much privacy as they wanted, as long as they used protection and were willing. Additionally, the author arranged for a friend to lie if the girl's parents showed up.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the teens (16), the parents' control issues, and the author's decision to deceive the other parents about their monitoring plans. The author believes their son is responsible and has already discussed consent and safety with him. However, the question is whether lying to the girl's parents is wrong.\n\nFirst, legal considerations: In many places, 16 is the age of consent, so the teens having consensual sex is legal. But the author's deception is about misleading the girl's parents, who might be overprotective. The author's actions could be seen as protecting their son's autonomy and privacy, but they're also lying to another parent about supervision, which could have consequences if something went wrong.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between the author's trust in their son's judgment and the girl's parents' concerns. The author might argue that the girl's parents are too controlling, so they're stepping in to protect their son. But by lying, they're not respecting the girl's parents' wishes, even if those parents are problematic. The author is making decisions about the girl's safety and their son's privacy without the girl's parents' knowledge, which could be seen as overstepping, especially since they're not the girl's legal guardians.\n\nAnother angle: The girl's parents wanted to ensure their daughter's safety, even if their methods are extreme. By lying about supervision, the author could be compromising the girl's safety if something happened. However, the author believes their son is responsible and that the girl's parents are too controlling. The author's actions might be seen as a protective measure for their son, but it's a lie that affects another family.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author is in a position where they have to balance their son's autonomy with the legal and ethical implications of their deception. While the girl's parents are indeed problematic, the act of lying could be seen as crossing a boundary, as they're not the legal guardians of the girl. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of protecting their son, but they're definitely in a grey area regarding the girl's parents' expectations.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they lied to another parent about supervision, which could put the girl at risk if they weren't actually monitoring. However, if the author's intentions were protective and based on their son's maturity, maybe B. But since the deception could affect another family's child, it's more likely A.\n"
