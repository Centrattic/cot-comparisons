They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents.\n\nFirst, the parents in question (the author and her husband) allowed their son, who is 16, to be sexually active with his girlfriend. They even gave him privacy and didn't monitor them as strictly as the girlfriend's parents wanted. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with issues like a narcissistic mother and an alcoholic father. The author's son and the girlfriend are already sexually active, which the author's parents seem okay with as long as they use protection.\n\nThe key points here are: the author lied to the girlfriend's parents about monitoring their son, and they even had a friend pretend to be a cousin to cover for them. The author is conflicted about whether they overstepped by making decisions for another family's child.\n\nLegally, the parents are the legal guardians of their own child, so they have authority over their son's actions. However, the girlfriend's parents have the same rights over their daughter. By lying and not enforcing the monitoring they promised, the author might have compromised the other parents' ability to protect their daughter. Even though the author's own views on teen sexuality are more lenient, the deception could be seen as undermining the other parents' wishes and potentially exposing their daughter to risks those parents wanted to avoid.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between the author's parenting choices and respecting the boundaries of another family. While the author believes in their son's autonomy, the girlfriend's parents have a right to set rules for their own child. The author's decision to deceive could be seen as prioritizing their own values over the other parents' wishes, which might not be justified, especially since they're not the legal guardians of the girlfriend.\n\nSo, even though the author's intentions might be to give their son privacy and agency, interfering in another parent's decisions crosses a line. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they misrepresented their intentions and actions to the other parents, which could be harmful and disrespectful.\n"
