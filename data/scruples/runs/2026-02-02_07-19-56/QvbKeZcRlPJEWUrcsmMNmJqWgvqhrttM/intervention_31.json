They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for lying to the girlfriend's parents about supervision. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' control over their daughter and their specific rules. The author's son and daughter are both 16 and already sexually active. The parents of the girlfriend are very controlling and asked the author to supervise them. Instead, the author lied, saying they would keep an eye on them when in reality they gave the teens privacy. Also, they had a friend cover for them if needed.\n\nSo, the author's son is their responsibility, but the girlfriend's parents have their own rules. The author made a decision that might not align with the girlfriend's parents' expectations. The question is whether lying to them makes the author wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is advocating for their son's privacy and autonomy, which is a valid concern. Teens needing their own space is natural. The controlling behavior of the girlfriend's parents is definitely a red flag, and the author might feel justified in not complying with their overbearing requests.\n\nHowever, the issue here is about the author's responsibility towards someone else's child. Even though the author's intentions are to protect their son's privacy, the parents of the girlfriend are the ones responsible for their daughter. By lying about supervision, the author is essentially undermining the parents' authority and possibly risking their daughter's safety. The author's son is an adult in the eyes of the law (though only 16), but the daughter is still underage. If the parents believe they have control and the author is not truthful, it could lead to complications, especially if something were to happen.\n\nAlso, the author's son and daughter are already sexually active. The author might think it's their right to have privacy, but by lying, they're not being honest with the parents who have a legal and parental responsibility. Even if the parents are overbearing, the author's actions could be seen as deceptive and potentially contributing to a risky situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the parent lied to the girlfriend's parents. That's a clear breach of trust. The author made a decision that affects not just their son but also another family's child. Even if the parents are controlling, the author's choice to lie isn't justified. They should have been honest and perhaps discussed boundaries with the girlfriend's parents or even with their own son about the situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong for lying. Even if the parents are problematic, the author's actions involve deception and not considering the other parents' wishes or the daughter's safety.\n"
