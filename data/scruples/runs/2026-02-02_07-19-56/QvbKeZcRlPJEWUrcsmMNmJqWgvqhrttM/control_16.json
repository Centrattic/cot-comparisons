They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The son and the girlfriend are both 16, which is a legal age where they can make their own decisions, but parents still have a role in their upbringing.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend's parents are controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The mom has strict rules about the son's behavior when he's at their house, like not being on the bed and checking on them. The author's son and the girl are already sexually active, and the author believes in giving them privacy as long as they're using protection.\n\nThe key point here is the lie. The author allowed their son and the girlfriend privacy, even going as far as to have a friend pretend to be their cousin if the other parents showed up. The other parents, however, wanted to ensure a parent was always present and that they kept an eye on them. The author agreed to this in front of their husband but didn't follow through, which constitutes lying.\n\nNow, considering the parents of the girlfriend are overbearing and controlling, the author might be trying to protect their son's autonomy. However, the other parents are still the legal guardians of their daughter. The author didn't consult with them about their son's behavior when they were present in their home. While the author's intentions might be to support their son's independence, they didn't consider the other parents' rights and concerns. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author had their friend lie adds another layer. Even if the other parents are problematic, lying to them could be seen as interfering in their parental responsibilities. The daughter is a minor, so both sets of parents have a role in her upbringing. The author's actions might have put the daughter in a situation her parents didn't agree to, which could be harmful if the parents have valid reasons for their rules, even if they are controlling.\n\nBut on the other hand, the daughter's parents are described as manipulative and controlling. The author might be protecting their son from an environment that's not healthy. However, the issue is about the author lying to the other parents about their son's activities when he's in their home. The author's son is in their home, so the parents have the right to set rules. If the author's son is in their home, the author shouldn't be making decisions about their daughter's privacy or safety without consulting them. \n\nSo, the author is in a difficult position, but the lie itself is the main issue. Even if the author believes the other parents are wrong, they didn't have the right to deceive them about their son's behavior in their own home. The daughter is a minor, and her parents have legal authority over her. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the other parents' authority and potentially putting the daughter in a situation that her parents didn't consent to. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they lied to the other parents about their son's activities, which affects another family's parental responsibilities.\n"
