They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents.\n\nFirst, the context: The parents in question have controlling and problematic behaviors\u2014narcissistic mom, alcoholic dad. The son and his girlfriend are both 16 and already sexually active. The parents have strict, changing rules about when the couple can be together and how. The author allowed their son privacy, even though the girlfriend's parents wanted constant supervision. They even had a friend lie about being a cousin to cover for them if needed.\n\nThe author's actions include lying to the girlfriend's parents about their plans, not adhering to the strict rules, and enabling the couple's privacy. The key points here are consent, the age of the teens, and the parents' control issues.\n\nLegally, in many places, 16 is the age of consent, so the sexual activity isn't illegal. The author's stance is that their son has agency over his body. However, the author did lie to the girlfriend's parents, which is the crux of the question. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents of the girlfriend might feel that the author overstepped by not respecting their rules and by lying. On the other hand, the author might argue that the girlfriend's parents are overbearing and that their son should have autonomy.\n\nBut ethically, lying to another parent about their child's activities could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the author believes the other parents are controlling. The author's actions could be considered meddling in another family's affairs and not being transparent, which might make them responsible. However, the author might also be protecting their son's privacy and autonomy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The lying aspect is a clear ethical issue, but the context of the girlfriend's parents' behavior complicates it. The author's justification is that the other parents are too controlling, but that doesn't necessarily justify lying. The answer could hinge on whether the deception was necessary or justified. Since the author chose to lie to protect their son's privacy without the other parents' consent, that might be seen as in the wrong. So, the answer might be A (Yes), but there's a counterargument for B (No) based on the context. However, the act of lying itself is typically seen as wrong, regardless of the reason. So leaning towards A.\n"
