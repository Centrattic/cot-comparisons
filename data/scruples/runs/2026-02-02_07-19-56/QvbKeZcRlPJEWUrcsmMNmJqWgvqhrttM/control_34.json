They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves a 16-year-old son and his girlfriend. The author's son is allowed to visit the girlfriend's house, where the parents have strict rules. The author and their husband told the girlfriend's parents they would supervise, but in reality, they gave the couple privacy.\n\nSo, the key points here are the lies told to the parents. The author's family agreed to have a parent present but instead arranged for a friend to cover for them if needed. The author's justification is that they believe in their son's privacy and autonomy, especially since they were sexually active at a younger age. However, they admit to feeling guilty about possibly overstepping regarding someone else's child.\n\nNow, considering the parents' controlling behavior and the fact that the couple is already sexually active, the author might think they're protecting their son's relationship. But the core issue is the deception. The author lied to the other parents, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if their own parenting style is more lenient, they don't have the authority to decide for another family's child. The girlfriend's parents, despite their flaws, are the legal guardians, so the author's actions might interfere with their parenting decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were being honest with their own son and respecting his autonomy. But lying to another parent about supervision could be problematic if the parents were concerned about their daughter's safety. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the other parents' wishes, regardless of their parenting style.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions are good, the act of lying crosses ethical boundaries. They shouldn't impose their views on another family's child without their consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they misrepresented their supervision to the girlfriend's parents, which is a form of deceit.\n"
