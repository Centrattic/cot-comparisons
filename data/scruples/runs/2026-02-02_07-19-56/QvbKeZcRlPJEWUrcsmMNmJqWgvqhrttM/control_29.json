They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The parents have controlling behaviors, and the author allowed their son privacy despite the parents' requests. Key points to consider:\n\n1. **Legal Age**: The kids are 16, which is the age of consent in many places. So, their sexual activity might be legal, but the parents are still concerned.\n\n2. **Consent and Privacy**: The author's son and daughter are in a consensual relationship. The author supports their privacy and autonomy, which aligns with respecting minors' rights, even if they're young.\n\n3. **Parents' Control Issues**: The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with strict rules and checking on the couple. This might be an overreach, and the author's decision to not enforce those rules could be seen as protecting their son's privacy against overbearing parents.\n\n4. **Deception**: The author lied about having a cousin to cover for their absence. This deception could be problematic if it's seen as undermining the girlfriend's parents' authority. However, if the parents are abusive or harmful, the author might argue it's necessary to protect their son.\n\n5. **Moral vs. Legal**: Legally, the author might be in the right if the parents are overstepping. Morally, it's a gray area. The author's actions protect their son's autonomy but deceive another family.\n\n6. **Intentions**: The author's intent was to respect their son's privacy and agency, which is commendable. The deception was a means to an end, not malicious.\n\n7. **Potential Harm**: If the deception leads to conflict or harm, it could be seen as wrong. But given the parents' controlling nature, the author might believe the alternative (strict control) is worse.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are more about protecting their son's autonomy against overbearing parents. While lying is involved, the context of the parents' behavior might justify the author's stance. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuanced understanding here.\n"
