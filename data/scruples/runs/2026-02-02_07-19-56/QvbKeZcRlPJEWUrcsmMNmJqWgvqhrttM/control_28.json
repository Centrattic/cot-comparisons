They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves the author's son and his 16-year-old girlfriend. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the author's son when he visits their daughter, checking on them regularly, and changing rules about being on the bed and curfews.\n\nWhen the girlfriend comes over to the author's house for the first time, the parents call ahead. The author is working, so the husband talks to them. The parents want to ensure a parent is home all the time and that they can monitor the kids. The author, however, believes in giving their son privacy and autonomy, even though they know the couple is already sexually active. The author even arranged for a friend to lie if the parents showed up. The author feels guilty but thinks the other parents are overcontrolling.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions in lying to the girlfriend's parents and whether that's wrong. The parents of the girlfriend have their own issues, but does that justify the author's deception? The author's intentions are to protect their son's privacy and autonomy, which is a valid concern. However, by lying to another parent about their child's safety and activities, the author might be compromising the other parents' right to know about their daughter's well-being. Even though the other parents are described as problematic, the author is another parent making decisions that affect another family. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by lying. Since the parents are not the guardians of the girlfriend, the author's actions could be seen as interfering in another family's parenting. Even if the author's intent is to be more lenient, lying to another parent about their child's safety might be unethical. The author's son is responsible for his own actions, but the author isn't responsible for the girlfriend's parents' parenting style. However, the author did make a choice that affects another child (the girlfriend), which could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nSo, even though the author's motives are good, the act of deception towards another parent's household could be considered wrong. The answer would be AITA (Am I the Asshole), so the author might be at fault here because they lied to another parent about their child's situation without considering that parent's rights and concerns, despite their own parenting style.\n"
