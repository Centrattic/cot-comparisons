They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. Their daughter is 16 and in a relationship with the author's son, who is also 16. The parents have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, like not allowing the boy on the bed under the covers. The author's son goes to the girl's house after school, and they pick him up. \n\nNow, the girl came over to the author's house for the first time. The girl's mom tried to call the author, but she was at work. The son offered to have her talk to the husband, but she only wanted the author. Then the dad called the husband and set some conditions about having a parent home all the time and keeping an eye on them. The husband agreed, but the author didn't actually follow through. They let the kids have privacy as long as they were using protection, even going as far as asking a friend to pretend to be their cousin if the parents showed up. \n\nThe author is conflicted because they believe in their son's privacy and autonomy, but they're worried about the other parents' over-control. They feel guilty about lying but think the other parents are too strict.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author did something wrong by lying to the other parents. Let's consider the key points. The author's actions were to deceive the girl's parents about their supervision. The parents of the girl have their own issues and control over their daughter, but the author is making decisions that affect another family's child. \n\nLegally, both the author and the girl's parents are responsible for their children. However, the author is making choices that go against the other parents' wishes. By lying, they're essentially undermining the girl's parents' rules, which could be seen as interfering. Even though the author has good intentions, they might be compromising the girl's safety and autonomy without her parents' consent. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict. The author might believe in giving their son privacy, but the girl is also involved. The girl's parents have a right to set boundaries for their daughter, even if they're overbearing. The author's actions could put the girl in a situation where she's not entirely safe, especially if the parents are neglectful or abusive. \n\nAnother angle is the age of the kids. They're 16, which is a minor age in many places, so parents have legal authority. The author is circumventing the other parents' authority, which could be problematic. Even if the author's own child is responsible, the other parents might be in a worse position to handle any issues that arise. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation is to protect their son's autonomy and respect his maturity. They've had open discussions about consent and safety. The fact that the kids are already sexually active complicates things because the parents might not be fully aware of their daughter's activities. The author might feel that the girl's parents are being unrealistic in their expectations.\n\nBut the core issue is deception. The author lied about their supervision. Even if they believe the other parents are overcontrolling, lying to another family's parents is a breach of trust. The girl's parents have a right to know what's happening with their daughter, especially if they're concerned about her safety. By not being truthful, the author is not respecting the other parents' parental rights, regardless of their flaws.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should consider that their actions could have consequences. If something happened to the daughter because the parents were misled about her safety, the author could be held accountable. Even if the parents are flawed, the author is not the one in a position to make those decisions for them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author's intentions might be good, their actions involve deception and overstepping their role as a parent of their own son. They are making decisions that affect another family's child without their consent, which is ethically problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
