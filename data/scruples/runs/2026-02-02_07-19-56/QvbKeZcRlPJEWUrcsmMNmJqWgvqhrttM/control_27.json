They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author lying to the girlfriend's parents about their son's activities.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's son is 16 and dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling and have issues (narcissistic mom, alcoholic dad). The parents set strict rules for the author's son when he visits their daughter. When the girl comes over to the author's house, the parents call to ensure supervision. The author's husband agrees to have a parent present, but the author and husband went out and had a friend pretend to be a cousin to cover for them if needed. The author's stance is that their son should have privacy and agency, even though they know the couple is sexually active.\n\nNow, the main questions here are about parental responsibility and boundaries. The author is a parent, so their main responsibility is to their own son. They have discussed consent, safety, and protection with him. However, the issue arises when the author decides to deceive the girlfriend's parents. The parents wanted to control the son's behavior and monitor the relationship closely, which the author finds overbearing.\n\nThe key ethical considerations here are: Did the author overstep by lying to another family's parents about their child's activities? The author's actions were intended to protect their son's privacy and autonomy, which is reasonable, but lying to another parent could be seen as deceptive. The girlfriend's parents are not the author's responsibility; their role is to parent their own children. However, by lying, the author might be undermining the other parents' authority and potentially putting the girlfriend in a risky situation if the parents are unaware of the true circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In some places, parents have the right to make decisions for their minor children, but the author's son is a minor, so the parents should guide him. However, the author is prioritizing their son's autonomy, which is a valid parent-child dynamic. The problem is that the parents of the girlfriend might have different standards, but the author isn't their parent, so they shouldn't be enforcing those rules.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as respecting their own child's maturity while disregarding another family's rules. Since the other parents are already controlling and have a problematic dynamic, the author might not be in the wrong for not complying. However, lying to them could be considered unethical because it's about another family's child and their well-being. The author might be assuming that the girlfriend is safe with their son, but they don't have control over that situation. \n\nIn terms of the AITA rating, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's justification is that the parents are overbearing, but lying introduces deception. If the parents of the girlfriend are concerned about their daughter's safety, the author's deception could be seen as neglecting that responsibility, even if indirectly. On the other hand, the author is protecting their son's privacy and trusting his judgment, which is part of parenting. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they lied to another family about their child's safety and supervision, even if their intentions were to protect their own son's autonomy. However, the other parents' control issues could mitigate that. But generally, lying to another parent about supervision of a minor, even if not directly their child, could be ethically questionable. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
