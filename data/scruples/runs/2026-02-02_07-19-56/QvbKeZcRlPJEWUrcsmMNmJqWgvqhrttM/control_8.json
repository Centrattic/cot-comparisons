They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their 16-year-old son's girlfriend's parents, who are described as controlling, narcissistic, and with an alcoholic father. The main issue is that the author lied to the girlfriend's parents about monitoring their kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. The author mentions that the girlfriend's parents wanted to ensure a parent was always home and that the author's family would keep an eye on them. However, the author and their husband actually gave the kids privacy and even arranged a friend to cover for them. The author's reasoning is that their son is responsible, they've talked about consent and protection, and they believe teens should have agency.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to lie. On one hand, the parents are over-controlling and harmful, so the author might feel justified in protecting their son's autonomy. On the other hand, the author is making decisions about someone else's child, which could be seen as interfering. However, since the parents are the ones being controlling, maybe the author is just countering their extreme behavior.\n\nThe author's actions included lying about their supervision and involving a friend to pretend to be present. While lying is generally frowned upon, in this context, it might be a way to protect their son's relationship and privacy from toxic parental interference. The key factors are the parents' controlling nature and the author's good intentions to support their son's autonomy and sexual health.\n\nBut is lying ever acceptable? It's a gray area. The author might argue that the ends justify the means, given the parents' behavior. However, there's a responsibility to be honest, even when dealing with difficult people. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the girlfriend's parents' authority, which might be inappropriate since they don't have the right to make decisions about another family's child.\n\nHowever, the author isn't directly harming the girlfriend; they're just allowing their son to have a relationship without the toxic influence of her parents. The fact that the couple is already sexually active might mean the author is more focused on safety and consent rather than preventing activity itself. The friend's cover-up wasn't necessary since the parents didn't show up, so maybe the lie didn't cause direct harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while lying is typically wrong, the context here is complex. The author is trying to protect their son from overbearing parents and promote autonomy. The answer might depend on whether one believes the author overstepped by making decisions about another child's privacy. However, given the parents' control issues, the author's actions could be seen as defending their son's rights, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
