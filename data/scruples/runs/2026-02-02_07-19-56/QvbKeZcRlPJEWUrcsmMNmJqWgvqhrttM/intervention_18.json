They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation involves a parent (the author) lying to the girlfriend's parents about their son's activities. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author's son is 16, as is the girlfriend. They've been dating for four months and are already sexually active. The parents of the girlfriend have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, and the author's family has been accommodating them by picking up the son and driving him to her house. \n\nThe key issue here is the author lying to the girlfriend's parents. The girlfriend comes over for the first time, and the author's husband agrees to the parents' request to have a parent present at all times. However, the author's stance is that their son should have privacy and autonomy. They made arrangements with a friend to pretend to be their cousin if the girlfriend's parents showed up, which they didn't need to do. The author is now questioning if they did the right thing by not respecting the girlfriend's parents' wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's actions involve deception towards another parent's request. The girlfriend's parents wanted to ensure their daughter's safety and that certain rules were followed. By lying about having a parent present and setting up a cover story, the author is undermining those parents' authority and potentially their ability to protect their daughter. \n\nEven though the author believes in their son's autonomy and privacy, the girlfriend's parents have their own responsibilities and concerns. The author's decision affects not just their son but also the girlfriend, whose parents might not be aware of the situation. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping because they're making decisions about another child's environment without consulting the other parents. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that the girlfriend's parents are over-controlling and that their approach is unhealthy. The author's son is already sexually active, and the parents' strict rules might not be in the daughter's best interest. The author could feel that their son is being treated unfairly and that the girlfriend's parents are being too restrictive. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, even if the author disagrees with the other parents' policies, they have a responsibility to communicate honestly and respect the other family's wishes when their children are involved. Deception here could erode trust and create a dangerous situation if the girlfriend is left unsupervised in a way that the parents consider inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's safety is a concern. If the parents are worried about her being alone with the son, the author's deception might put her in a situation where they can't monitor things as they intended. The author's actions could be seen as prioritizing their son's privacy over the safety of another teenager. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that their son and the girlfriend can handle their relationship responsibly, and that the other parents' control is harmful. However, even with that belief, the author shouldn't unilaterally decide for another parent's child. There's a lack of communication and collaboration here. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to protect their son's autonomy, the method they used\u2014deception\u2014involved disregarding the other parents' wishes and potentially putting the girlfriend at risk. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with honesty and respect for all parties involved.\n"
