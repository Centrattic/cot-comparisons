They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The parents in question are described as controlling and overbearing, with strict rules about their daughter's interactions. The author's son and the girlfriend are both 16 and already sexually active. The author and their husband agreed to a friend covering for them in case the girlfriend's parents showed up, even though they didn't end up needing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the teens. In many places, 16 is the legal age of consent, so their sexual activity might be legal. However, the parents are trying to enforce their own rules, which the author finds excessive. The author's intention was to give their son privacy and autonomy, which they believe is important. But the question is about lying to the other parents.\n\nThe key issue here is the author lying to the other parents by having a friend pretend to be a cousin. Even though the author's own child is involved, they are making decisions that affect another family's child. The parents of the girl set up specific rules and expectations, and the author's actions (lying to cover their absence) could be seen as undermining those parents' authority. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that the girl's parents are overbearing, and their own approach is more open and trusting. But the act of lying to the other parents, regardless of the reasoning, could be considered a breach of trust or a deception. Even if the author's intentions are good, intentionally misleading another family about their presence might be ethically questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parents are indeed controlling and the teens are making their own choices responsibly, maybe the author's approach is more supportive. But the deception part is the crux here. The author is in a position where they have to balance their son's autonomy with respecting another family's wishes. By lying, they're not just deceiving the parents but also not being transparent about their intentions, which could lead to conflict or mistrust later on.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the act of lying to another family about their child's well-being and activities is ethically problematic, regardless of the reasoning. Even if the author believes their approach is better, the deception could be seen as crossing a line.\n"
