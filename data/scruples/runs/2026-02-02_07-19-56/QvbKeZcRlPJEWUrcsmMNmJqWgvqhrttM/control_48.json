They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. \n\nFirst, the situation: The son is 16 and dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The parents have strict rules about the relationship, even checking on them regularly. When the girl comes over for the first time, the author's husband agrees to the parents' demands to have a parent present at all times. However, the author actually gives the teenagers privacy and even arranges for a friend to cover if the girl's parents show up.\n\nThe main issue here is the deception. The author lied to the girl's parents about their intentions, which they later admitted to themselves. The parents believed they would have supervision, but in reality, the author allowed privacy. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's parents are overbearing and controlling, possibly to an unhealthy extent. The author might feel that their son deserves autonomy and privacy, especially since the parents are already being overly strict. The author has also discussed consent and safety with their son, which is a responsible approach. \n\nOn the other hand, lying to another parent about the supervision of their child could be seen as a breach of trust and responsibility. The author is making a decision that affects another family's child without consulting the parents. Even if the author believes the other parents are too controlling, it's still their child's safety and well-being that's in question. The author might be putting the girl in a risky situation if there are any unforeseen issues, and they're not being honest about their intentions.\n\nThere's also the aspect of parental responsibility. If the author is supposed to be a responsible adult, lying to another parent about supervision could be seen as negligent. The author's justification is that they trust their son and have educated him about consent and safety, but the girl's parents have different expectations. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the other parents' rules without a valid reason.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the girl's parents are not providing a healthy environment, and by allowing privacy, they're giving the teens a safer space. The author's actions could be motivated by a desire to protect both their son and the girl from the toxic control of her parents. \n\nBut deception is a key point here. Even if the author's intentions are good, lying to another parent is ethically questionable. It could lead to a breakdown in trust and potential conflicts. The author is making a decision for someone else's child without their consent, which is a problem regardless of the reasoning.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children. The author, as a parent, might have the right to allow their son privacy at their home, but they shouldn't mislead another parent about supervision. The author's actions could be seen as a violation of the other parents' wishes, even if they disagree with those wishes. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they lied to another parent about their intentions, which is a breach of trust. Even if their intentions were to protect their son and the girl from overbearing parents, the deception is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
