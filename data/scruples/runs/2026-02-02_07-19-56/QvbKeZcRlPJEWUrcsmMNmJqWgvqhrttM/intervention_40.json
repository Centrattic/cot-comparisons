They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent's son is 16 and dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling and have issues (narcissistic mom, alcoholic dad). The parents have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, like not being on the bed with the covers on. The girl comes over to the parent's house for the first time. The girl's parents called to talk, but the parent was working, so the husband spoke. They agreed to keep a parent home all the time. However, the parent actually told their son they could have privacy as long as they used protection. They even arranged for a friend to cover if the girl's parents showed up. The parent feels guilty about lying but thinks the girl's parents are overbearing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but is asking for my opinion.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The parent's actions involve lying to the girl's parents. The parents of the girl have specific rules and expectations, possibly to protect their daughter. The parent's son is already sexually active, so the parent's stance is about giving privacy and autonomy. But the parent lied about their supervision, which could be seen as deceptive. However, the parent might argue that the girl's parents are too restrictive and that their own approach is more about trust and education.\n\nIs lying to another parent about supervision of their child a breach of trust? Yes. Even if the parent believes their approach is better, they didn't consult the other parents. The girl is a minor, and her parents have legal authority. The parent's actions might put the girl in a situation where she's not being supervised as agreed upon. This could be seen as a violation of the agreement made with the girl's parents. The parent might be overstepping by making decisions that affect another family's child without their consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to provide a safe and trusting environment for their son. They've discussed consent and safety with him. However, the ethical dilemma here is about respecting the legal guardians' wishes versus the parent's own values. Since the girl is under her parents' care, the parent's deception could be seen as interfering in the other family's parenting decisions. Even if the parent's approach is more lenient, lying about supervision is a form of manipulation that could have consequences if something were to go wrong.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing. However, when it comes to another family's child, the parent's actions can be considered a breach of trust. The parent should have been honest about their approach rather than lying. Even if they disagree with the girl's parents' rules, they should have communicated openly instead of deceiving them.\n\nTherefore, the parent's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, involve dishonesty and could be seen as in the wrong because they undermined the other parents' authority without their consent. So the answer is A.\n"
