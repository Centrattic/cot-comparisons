They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves the parents being very controlling and the author feeling that they should give their son privacy despite the girlfriend's parents' strict rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son and girlfriend are both 16, which is the age of consent in many places, so their relationship is legally permitted. The author's actions were to protect their son's autonomy and privacy, which could be seen as a parent's right. However, the parents did agree to certain conditions when the girlfriend's parents called, but then went against them by lying about their plans and involving a friend to cover their absence.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be justified in protecting their son from overbearing parents. On the other hand, they did lie to the girlfriend's parents about their intentions, which could be seen as deceptive. The key point is whether the author overstepped by making decisions that affect another person's child without considering the parents' wishes. Even if the author believes the girlfriend's parents are too controlling, lying about their supervision could be seen as undermining the parents' authority and potentially putting the children in a risky situation if something went wrong. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and responsibility. The author mentions that the son is mature and responsible, but the parents might have different standards. The author's friend covering for them adds another layer of deception. While the author's intention was to give the kids privacy, the method (lying) could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because they were advocating for their son's autonomy. However, the act of lying and deceiving another set of parents could be seen as ethically wrong, regardless of their intentions. The answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. Since the author's actions involved deception and could be seen as interfering with the girlfriend's parents' parental rights, even if those parents are controlling, the author might still be at fault for lying.\n"
