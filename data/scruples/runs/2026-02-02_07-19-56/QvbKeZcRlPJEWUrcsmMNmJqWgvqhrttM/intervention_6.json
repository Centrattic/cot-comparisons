They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author did something wrong by lying to the girlfriend's parents.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's son is 16, dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The parents have strict rules about the son's behavior when he visits their daughter. The girl came over for the first time, and the parents called the author (who was working) and spoke to her husband. They wanted to ensure a parent was home at all times. The author, however, told her husband they'd be there, but actually left and had a friend cover. The author believes her son should have privacy and that the other parents are overbearing.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe author's justification is that the other parents are too controlling, and she believes her son should have agency. She's also aware that teens are sexually active and wants to respect her son's autonomy. However, she lied to the other parents, which could be seen as deception. The key point is that she made a decision affecting another family's child without their consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents of the girlfriend have their own strict rules, which the author disagrees with. The author's actions were to protect her son's privacy and autonomy, which she believes is right. But lying to another parent about their child's safety could be problematic. Even if she believes her approach is better, overriding another parent's wishes (however flawed they may be) could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is balancing a parent's authority over their child versus respecting another family's decisions. The author's actions might be seen as undermining the girlfriend's parents' boundaries. Even if the parents are problematic, manipulating the situation to avoid their rules without consent could be considered wrong. The author's friend acting as a \"cover\" is a lie to the other parents, which could have risks if things went differently.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a close call. If the parents had communicated concerns about privacy, maybe the author could have discussed it. But she chose to deceive instead of finding a middle ground. The fact that the other parents wanted to ensure supervision and the author lied about complying might justify the answer that she's in the wrong, as she broke trust and potentially endangered the situation if something had gone wrong.\n\nBut another perspective: The author is acting in her son's best interest, and the other parents' rules are restrictive. However, lying to another parent about their child's safety is a breach of trust. So, even if the author's intentions were good, the action of lying is what's in question. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she deceived another parent about their child's supervision.\n"
