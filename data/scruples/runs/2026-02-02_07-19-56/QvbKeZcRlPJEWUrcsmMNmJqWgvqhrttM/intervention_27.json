They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves the parents being very controlling, and the author allowed their son privacy when the girlfriend came over, even lying about their whereabouts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, narcissistic, and with an alcoholic father. They have strict rules about their daughter's chastity and the author's son when he visits. The author's son is 16, and they've already been sexually active. The author lied to the girlfriend's parents by having a friend pretend to be a cousin if the parents came over. The author believes their son is responsible and trustworthy but is questioning if they overstepped by making decisions about the girlfriend's privacy.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to make decisions regarding the privacy of the girlfriend, who is another person's child. The author's actions were to give their son privacy, but they didn't consider the parents' perspective. Since the girlfriend's parents set rules for their own daughter, the author might have crossed a boundary by not respecting those rules when the girl came to their house. Even though the parents are described as overbearing, the author didn't get consent from them to alter their rules for their own son. The author's decision to lie and enable privacy could be seen as interfering in the other parents' role in monitoring their daughter's activities. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that their son is responsible and that the girlfriend's parents are too controlling. However, the ethical dilemma here is about respecting the custody and authority of the girlfriend's parents. The author's actions could have placed the girlfriend in a situation that her parents didn't approve of, which could be a breach of their parenting rights. Even if the author believes in the teens' autonomy, they are not the ones in charge of the girlfriend's well-being or decisions. Therefore, the author's actions, while well-intentioned, might be considered wrong because they didn't respect the other parents' wishes and potentially compromised their ability to parent their own child.\n"
