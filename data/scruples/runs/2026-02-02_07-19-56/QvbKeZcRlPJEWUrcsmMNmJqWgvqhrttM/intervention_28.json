They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their son, who's 16, dating a girl whose parents are controlling. The parents have lots of rules and seem to be checking up on them. The girl comes over for the first time, and the parents call to talk to the author, who's a correctional officer and not home. The son suggests the husband talk, but the mom only wants to talk to the author. Then the dad calls the husband and wants to ensure a parent is home all the time. The author's husband agrees, but the author actually gives their son privacy, even going as far as getting a friend to cover if the girl's parents come. The author is wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're at fault. The author's reasoning is that the girl's parents are over-the-top control freaks, and they believe their son deserves privacy and agency. However, they lied to the girl's parents to allow their son to have privacy. \n\nNow, the key points here are about consent and the parents' authority. The author's son and the girl are both minors, 16 years old. In many places, minors are still under the care and legal responsibility of their parents. The girl's parents are trying to set boundaries, even if they seem strict. The author's actions involved lying to them, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author believes in their son's autonomy, they're making decisions that affect another family's child. \n\nAlso, the parents of the girl have the legal right to set rules for their daughter when she's in their home or visiting others. The author's decision to deceive them might undermine the girl's parents' ability to protect their daughter. Even if the author's intentions are good, the act of deception could be problematic because it involves another person's child without their consent. \n\nAnother angle is the aspect of the author's own child. The son is 16, and the parents have discussed consent and responsibility with him. However, the author is making decisions about when and how their son interacts with the girl, which the girl's parents might not agree with. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl's parents have specific concerns about her safety or well-being. \n\nThere's also the issue of the friend covering for them. If the parents had shown up, the friend was supposed to pretend to be the author's cousin. That's a direct lie, which could have legal or social repercussions if discovered. Even though it didn't come to that, the intent to deceive is there.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the girl's parents are being overly controlling and that the teens are already sexually active, so the rules are unnecessary. The author could believe that they're protecting their son's autonomy and allowing him and the girl to make their own decisions responsibly. However, the parents of the girl have the right to set the terms for their child, especially regarding her safety and boundaries. The author's actions could be seen as interfering with the other parents' parenting decisions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, lying is generally considered wrong, especially when it affects someone else's child. The author might have a valid point about the girl's parents being controlling, but bypassing their rules through deception isn't the right approach. A better solution might have been to have an honest conversation with the girl's parents about the situation and the author's stance, even if it led to conflict. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions involved deception towards another set of parents, which is ethically questionable. Even if the intentions are good, the method is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
