They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves teenagers who are 16, and the parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling and with some issues. The author allowed her son to be private and even arranged for a friend to cover if the girlfriend's parents visited. The key points here are consent, the parents' control, and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the author's son and his girlfriend are both of age where they can make their own decisions, though still minors. The mother is lying to the girlfriend's parents about her son's activities. The girlfriend's parents are controlling and have strict rules, so the author is trying to protect her son's autonomy. The author believes in giving teens privacy and has educated her son about consent and protection. The action taken was to deceive the girlfriend's parents to allow privacy. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. On one hand, she's respecting her son's autonomy and trusting his judgment, which is a valid parental approach. On the other hand, she's lying to another parent, which could be seen as unethical or inappropriate. However, considering the controlling nature of the girlfriend's parents, the author might feel justified in protecting her son from overbearing control. The answer hinges on whether deception is acceptable in this context, especially when it's to protect a child's autonomy against overbearing parents. There's a balance between respecting other parents' wishes and protecting one's child's rights. The author's actions might be seen as defending her son's privacy, so maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
