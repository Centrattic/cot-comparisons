They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents about monitoring their relationship.\n\nFirst, the parents of the girl are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, checking on her, and wanting to ensure their son-in-law is supervised. The author's family, on the other hand, is more lenient. They\u2019ve already discussed sex and consent with their son, who is 16, and they\u2019ve allowed the couple to be private, even to the point of having a friend lie if the girl's parents checked in. The author is conflicted but stands by their belief in their son's autonomy.\n\nThe key points here are the lies the author tells. They agreed to the girl's parents' conditions but then intentionally deceived them by having a friend act as a cousin. The author didn't monitor the couple as promised and allowed them privacy. The girl's parents were concerned about their daughter's safety, so the author's actions could be seen as undermining those parents' wishes and potentially putting the girl at risk. However, the author believes the parents are overbearing and that their son should have autonomy.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's a balance. Parents have the right to set boundaries for their child, but the author is another parent who may not be obligated to follow those guidelines. However, by agreeing to the parents' terms, the author committed to certain conditions. Breaking those could be considered a breach of trust. On the other hand, if the author believes the parents are harmful, they might think protecting their son's autonomy is more important.\n\nBut the act of lying\u2014especially arranging a cover story\u2014is problematic. It could expose the girl to potential risks if the parents' concerns are valid, even if they are overbearing. The author's actions might not be \"wrong\" in the sense of malicious intent, but ethically, they are making a choice that disregards the other parents' wishes and could put the girl in a situation where her parents' rules are ignored. This could lead to conflicts or worse consequences if the girl's parents find out.\n\nSo, considering the deception and potential risks, the author might be in the wrong for not honoring the agreement made with the girl's parents, even if their motivations were to protect their son's privacy. The answer leans towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the intentional lies and not respecting the agreed-upon conditions.\n"
