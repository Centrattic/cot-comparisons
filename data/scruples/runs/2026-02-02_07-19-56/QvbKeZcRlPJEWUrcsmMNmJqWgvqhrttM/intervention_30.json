They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling and have strict rules. The parent in question allowed their son to have privacy with his girlfriend, even though the girlfriend's parents wanted supervision. They also had a friend lie in case the girlfriend's parents showed up.\n\nFirst, the parent's actions: They didn't inform the girlfriend's parents about their son's activities and set up a cover with a friend. The son and girlfriend are both teenagers and already sexually active. The parent's justification is that they believe in their son's autonomy and privacy, even though they might not agree with the girlfriend's parents' strict rules.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical standards. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their own children's privacy and activities. However, when it comes to another child, especially a minor, the situation is trickier. The girlfriend's parents have their own rights and responsibilities. By allowing their son to be alone with another minor without informing the other parents, the parent might be overstepping. Even if the girlfriend's parents are controlling, the parent's actions could be seen as interfering in the other family's parenting decisions.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent and safety. If the son is mature enough to make responsible decisions about consent and protection, that's a positive. However, the parent enabling privacy without considering the other family's concerns could lead to potential issues that either parent might not be prepared for. The fact that they had a friend lie adds another layer of deception, which might not be necessary if they were honest about their approach.\n\nThe key point here is that while the parent's intention was to respect their son's autonomy, they didn't consider the legal and ethical implications of letting their son be alone with another minor without the other parents' knowledge. It's possible that the girlfriend's parents have a right to know about their daughter's activities, especially if they are concerned about her well-being. The parent's actions might be seen as undermining the other parents' authority and potentially putting the daughter in a situation they didn't agree to.\n\nSo, balancing the parent's desire for their son's autonomy against the rights of the other parents and the safety of the other child, the parent might be in the wrong for not disclosing their intentions and for not respecting the other family's boundaries, even if those parents are overbearing.\n"
