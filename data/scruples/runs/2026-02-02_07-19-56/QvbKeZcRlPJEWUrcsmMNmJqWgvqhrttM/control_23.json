They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a mom who lied to her son's girlfriend's parents. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the author's son when he's at their house, checking on them to ensure they're not being too physical. The author and her husband decide not to be as controlling when the girlfriend visits their home. The mom lied about their plans to the girlfriend's parents, even arranging for a friend to pretend to be a cousin if the parents showed up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's actions were motivated by a desire to give her son privacy and autonomy, which she believes is important at his age. However, the girlfriend's parents were already very involved and controlling. The author is aware that the couple is already sexually active, so she wants them to have the privacy to manage their relationship as they see fit. But she's lying to the other parents, which is a form of deception.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is the parent of her son, so she has the right to make decisions about his upbringing. The girlfriend's parents have their own parenting style, which the author finds overbearing. However, by lying to those parents, she's interfering in their parenting decisions. The question is whether that interference is justified.\n\nEthically, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is protecting her son from what she sees as excessive control. On the other hand, she's lying to another set of parents about their own child's safety and supervision. Even though the girlfriend's parents might be problematic, the author is taking away their ability to make decisions about their daughter's interactions. The author's friend pretending to be a cousin is also a lie, which adds to the deception.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm. The author believes her son is responsible and has discussed consent and protection with him. But by not being honest with the other parents, there's a risk that if something were to happen, the author's actions could be seen as negligent. However, given the parents' controlling nature, the author might think that their involvement is more harmful.\n\nThe key points here are consent and agency. The author is allowing her son and his girlfriend to have privacy, which they might not get at home. But she's doing so by deceiving the other parents. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If the author's intention is to protect her son's autonomy and the girlfriend's freedom from overly controlling parents, but the method involves lying, that's where the conflict lies.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the parent of her son, so her decisions about his upbringing are her right. However, she's also affecting the other child, the girlfriend. By not being truthful to the girlfriend's parents, she's not allowing them to make informed decisions about their daughter's safety. Even if those parents are problematic, the author might be overstepping by not being honest with them.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, is the author in the wrong? She's lying to protect her son's privacy, which is a valid concern, but deception is involved. If the parents were negligent or harmful, maybe there's a different approach. However, the author's actions could be seen as undermining the other parents' authority, even if they are controlling. There's a balance between respecting other parents' rights and protecting one's own child's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong in her intentions, but the act of lying and deception could place her in the wrong.\n"
