They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves lying to the girlfriend's parents about supervision. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling and have strict rules. The author's son and his girlfriend are both 16 and already sexually active. The parents wanted the author to ensure they were supervised, but the author and her husband went out and had a friend pretend to be there. The author is now wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age. In many places, 16 is the age of consent, so the teens are within their rights to be sexually active. The author's actions were to protect their son's privacy and autonomy, which they believe he's capable of handling. However, the question is about lying to the girlfriend's parents. The parents have their own rules and expectations, but they might have the right to expect that the other parents are supervising their child.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions were to support their son's autonomy and trust him, which is a valid parenting approach. On the other hand, by lying to the girlfriend's parents, they might be undermining the parents' authority over their own child. Even though the parents are described as controlling, the author still made a choice that affects another family's decisions. The part where they had a friend pretend to be there could be seen as deceptive, especially since they knew the parents had specific requests for supervision. Even if the teens are already sexually active, the parents have the right to make rules for their home, and the author's actions might have put the girlfriend in a situation where she's being monitored without her parents' knowledge.\n\nSo, the conflict is between the author's parenting approach and respecting the other parents' wishes. The author might not be in the wrong in their own parenting style, but by lying to the other parents, they could be in the wrong because they're interfering with the other family's decisions. The key point is whether the author's actions crossed a line by deceiving the girlfriend's parents, even if they believe the parents are overbearing. The answer might depend on cultural or legal norms, but generally, lying to another parent about supervision could be seen as problematic, regardless of the reasoning.\n"
