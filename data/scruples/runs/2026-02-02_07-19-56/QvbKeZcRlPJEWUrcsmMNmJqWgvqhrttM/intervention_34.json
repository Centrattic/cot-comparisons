They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves the parents being very controlling and the author's family making arrangements to let their son and the girl have privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's son is 16 and in a relationship with a girl whose parents are described as controlling, narcissistic, and with an alcoholic father. The author allowed the couple to have privacy, even when they were sexually active, and lied to the girl's parents about having a friend cover for them.\n\nThe main issue here is whether lying to another parent about the supervision of their child is wrong. The author justifies it by saying they trust their son and believe the girl's parents are overcontrolling. But the lie could be seen as interfering with the other parents' authority over their daughter. Even if the author's intentions are good, deception might not be the right approach, especially when it involves another family's child. \n\nEthically, parents have a responsibility to protect their children's well-being. If the author knew the girl's parents were being harmful, maybe they should have involved authorities instead of lying. However, the author might argue they were protecting their son's autonomy. But lying to the girl's parents could compromise the girl's safety if her parents are indeed abusive. The author's actions might prevent the parents from realizing their behavior is problematic, which could be harmful in the long run.\n\nAlso, the fact that the couple is sexually active at 16 raises questions about consent and safety. Even if the author supports their privacy, the deception towards another parent might not be justified. There's a balance between respecting a child's autonomy and ensuring their safety. The author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their son's privacy over the girl's potential need for protection, especially given the parents' issues. But if the girl is capable and the parents are indeed abusive, maybe the author is trying to help.\n\nHmm, it's tricky. The author's actions might be well-meaning, but lying to another parent is still a breach of trust and could put the girl at risk. The answer might depend on whether the deception was in the girl's best interest. If the parents are abusive, maybe the author should have stepped in differently. However, lying to them isn't the right approach. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve proper channels but tried to handle it secretly.\n"
