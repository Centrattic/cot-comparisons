They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a parent of a 16-year-old son who's dating a girl. Her parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the son when he's at their house, like not on the bed or under the covers. The parents are very controlling, and they called the author to set up rules for when the girl comes over to their house. The author and her husband agreed to certain things but then lied, saying a friend would be home to \"cover\" if the girl's parents showed up. The author's reasoning is that she believes her son should have privacy and that the girl's parents are over the top.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the author is allowing her son a level of privacy and autonomy that the girl's parents clearly don't want. The parents of the girl seem to have their own issues, and the author might feel that they're being too controlling. The author's own experience with being sexually active at a younger age and her open discussions with her son about consent and safety could influence her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is deceiving the girl's parents. Even if the author believes in her son's autonomy, lying about having someone home when they weren't could be seen as undermining the girl's parents' wishes. The parents had explicitly asked for a parent to be present at all times, and the author lied about that. This could potentially put the teenagers in a situation where they're not being supervised as agreed, which might lead to risks for both kids. The author's actions could be seen as enabling the teens to have privacy without the consent of the other parent, which might be considered a breach of trust or responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, the author's son and the girlfriend are both 16, so they are minors. The parents of the girlfriend have their own house rules, and while the author's home is different, the deception might not be in the best interest of the other child. The girl's parents might be concerned about their daughter's well-being, even if their methods are controlling. By lying, the author might be contributing to a situation where the girl could be in a compromising position without any adult oversight.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect her son's autonomy and allow him privacy, which is a valid concern. The parents of the girlfriend are portrayed as problematic, which might influence the perception of the situation. The author might feel that her own parenting style is more appropriate, and that the other parents are being overly restrictive. There's a balance between respecting other parents' wishes and upholding one's own values.\n\nBut lying to another parent about having an adult present, even if the intention is good, could be seen as a breach of trust. The author agreed to the parents' conditions but then went back on that agreement through deception. This could lead to the girl's parents feeling betrayed or could put the teens in a risky situation if something were to happen. The key issue here is whether the author's actions, while well-intentioned, were justified in deceiving the other parents. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents have the right to set boundaries for their own children, but when it comes to another child, there's a responsibility to respect those boundaries. The author's deception might be seen as overstepping that responsibility. However, if the girl's parents are indeed negligent or harmful, the author might be trying to protect her son from an unhealthy environment. But the line between protection and deception is blurry here. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions are driven by a desire to give her son autonomy and privacy, which is understandable. However, the act of lying to the girl's parents about having a parent present could be seen as unethical or a breach of the agreement they made. While the parents of the girlfriend may be problematic, the author's response through deception might not be the right approach. The author might be in the wrong for not honoring the agreement and for potentially putting both teens in an unsupervised situation, even if the intention was good.\n"
