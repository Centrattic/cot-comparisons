They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author's son is 16 and has been seeing the girl for four months. The parents have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, checking on them, and varying curfews. The girlfriend came over to the author's house for the first time. The parents called beforehand, and the author's husband agreed to certain conditions, but the author lied by telling her friend to pretend to be her cousin if the parents showed up. The author believes her son should have privacy and agency, even though the girl's parents are overbearing.\n\nFirst, the author is lying to another family's parents about their intentions. The parents of the girlfriend are already controlling, which adds complexity. The author's son and the girlfriend are both sexually active, which the parents might not know. The author arranged for a cover story in case the parents showed up, even though they didn't need to use it. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the rights of parents versus the rights of the teens. The author believes her son should have privacy, but the girlfriend's parents are the legal guardians. By lying to them, the author is undermining their parental authority. Even if the parents are overbearing, the author is making decisions about another parent's child without their consent. The teens are minors, so their parents have the right to set boundaries. The author's actions could potentially put the girlfriend in a situation where her parents are unaware of her activities, which might conflict with their values or wishes. \n\nHowever, the author's intent was to protect her son's privacy and autonomy. But since the girlfriend's parents are the legal guardians, the author might be overstepping by not being honest with them. The situation is tricky because the parents are portrayed as problematic, but the author is also a parent trying to protect her child's interests. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, the author is lying to another family's parents, which is a breach of trust. Even if her intentions are good, the act of deception is ethically questionable. The parents have a right to know about their daughter's activities when she's in a different environment. The author's actions could lead to the parents discovering the lie, which might escalate tensions or put the girlfriend in a difficult position. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because she deceived the girlfriend's parents, even though her motivations were protective of her son. The parents have a right to some level of information about their child's activities, especially when she's in a different household. The author's decision to lie and set up a cover story without the other parents' consent crosses ethical boundaries, regardless of the parents' controlling nature.\n"
