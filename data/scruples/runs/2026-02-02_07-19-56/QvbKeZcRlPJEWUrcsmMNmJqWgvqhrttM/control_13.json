They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation is that the parents are controlling and have strict rules about their daughter's interactions with the boy. The author's son is 16, and they've been dating for four months. The author allowed the daughter to stay overnight, even though her parents wanted to ensure a parent was always present. The author lied by getting a friend to pretend to be a cousin to cover for them if the parents showed up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age. In many places, 16 is the age of consent, but it's important to check the jurisdiction. Assuming it's legal for them to be sexually active, the parents' control might be overstepping. However, the author is making decisions about another child's parent's rules. The parents had specific requests for their daughter's safety, even if they're controlling. The author's actions could be seen as undermining those parents' authority. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the parents are too controlling, and they trust their son to make responsible decisions. They also have discussed consent and safety with their son. However, by lying to the girlfriend's parents, the author is not respecting the other parents' wishes, which might be a breach of trust. The author's actions could put the daughter in a situation where her parents' rules are ignored, which might be a problem if the daughter's parents have valid concerns, even if they're overbearing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is acting in the best interest of their son's relationship and autonomy. The key points are whether the author overstepped by making decisions for another family's child. Even if the parents are controlling, the author's deception (like the fake cousin) is a lie that could have significant consequences. The daughter might not have the agency to choose her own environment in this case, but the author is making that choice for her, which could be problematic.\n\nSo, the author's actions involve lying and not being honest with the other parents, which is a breach of trust. Even if the author believes the parents are overbearing, they should have communicated openly rather than lied. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the deception, even if their intentions were good.\n"
