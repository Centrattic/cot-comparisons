They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent lying to her son's girlfriend's parents about their interactions. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parents have a son and a girlfriend, both 16. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The mom has strict, changing rules about what the boy can and can't do when visiting her daughter. The parents wanted to ensure they were supervised, but the author's family didn't follow through. Instead, they lied by having a friend pretend to be a cousin to cover if the parents showed up.\n\nThe key points here are: the author allowed her son privacy, even though the girlfriend's parents wanted supervision. The author believes in her son's autonomy and has discussed consent and protection with him. The girl's parents are portrayed as overbearing. The author is now questioning if she was wrong to make decisions involving another parent's child.\n\nSo, the main ethical question is whether the author overstepped by making decisions about another child's welfare. While the author's intentions might be good\u2014supporting her son's autonomy and rejecting the girlfriend's parents' strictness\u2014there's a line when it comes to another family's child. The girlfriend's parents have a right to certain expectations regarding their daughter's safety, even if they're controlling. The author's actions might undermine that, even if her own child is responsible.\n\nHowever, the author's rationale is that the girl's parents are too controlling and that her son is mature. The question is whether lying to another parent's face about their child's safety is acceptable. Legally, parents have responsibility for their own children, but others aren't typically involved. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the other parents' wishes, even if she disagrees with them. But the parents' controlling behavior complicates things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's son is 16 and sexually active. The author trusted him, which is one thing, but involving another parent's child in that dynamic is different. The girlfriend's parents might have a say in their own daughter's safety. The author's lie could be seen as deceptive and not considering the other parents' rights, even if she finds them problematic. So, there's a mix of good intentions and potential overreach.\n\nIn AITA terms, the community often looks at both intent and the situation. The author's intent was to protect her son's autonomy, but by lying about another child's parent's expectations, she might have crossed a line. So, the answer could lean towards A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she made decisions regarding another family's child without their consent, even if the parents are flawed. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the community sees the girl's parents as overly controlling and the author's actions as reasonable.\n\nBut the key is that the author made a choice that affects another parent's child. Even if she disagrees with their parenting, lying to them about their daughter's safety is a breach. So, the answer might be A. However, if the community feels the other parents are too controlling and the author acted in good faith, it could be B. It's a tricky balance.\n"
