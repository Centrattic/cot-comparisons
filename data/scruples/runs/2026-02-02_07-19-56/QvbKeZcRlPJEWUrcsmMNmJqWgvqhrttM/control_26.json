They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. The author's son and his girlfriend are both 16 and sexually active. The parents of the girlfriend are very controlling and have strict rules about their daughter's interactions. The author allowed the couple privacy, even going so far as to have a friend pretend to be her cousin if the parents showed up. The parents of the girl are described as controlling, narcissistic, and with an alcoholic dad.\n\nFirst, the author's actions involve lying to the other parents. She agreed to have her friend cover for them if the girl's parents came over. The parents expected the author to be home all the time and to monitor the couple, but she didn't and lied about it. The key points here are the deception and the potential risks involved.\n\nLegally, 16 is the age of consent in many places, so if both teens are willing and using protection, it's not illegal. However, the parents of the girl have the right to set rules for their daughter. The author is interfering with those parental decisions. Even though the author believes in her son's autonomy, she's making decisions about another person's child without the parents' consent. This is where the ethical dilemma lies.\n\nThe author's justification is that the girl's parents are overbearing and controlling, and she wants her son to have privacy. But the fact remains that she's deceiving the other parents and not honoring the agreements she made. The parents had a right to expect that the author would follow through on the conditions they set for their daughter's visit. By lying, she's undermining their authority and putting her own values above the parents' wishes.\n\nThere's also the aspect of accountability. If something were to happen, the author could be blamed for not following through on her part of the agreement. Even if her intentions were good, the deception is a breach of trust with the other parents. The parents might feel violated that their trust was betrayed, especially considering their own parenting style.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions are motivated by a desire to support her son's autonomy and agency. However, that doesn't negate the fact that she's lying and manipulating the situation. The ethical consideration here is whether the ends justify the means. Even if her intentions were good, the method of deception is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did lie to the other parents and broke the agreement she made. While her motivations might be understandable, the act of deception is what makes her actions questionable. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
