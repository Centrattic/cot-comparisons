They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for lying to the girlfriend's parents about their son's activities. \n\nFirst, the parents are described as controlling with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The girl's parents have strict rules about when their daughter can be with the boyfriend and what they can do. The author's son is 16, and they've already been sexually active. \n\nThe author allowed their son privacy, even going as far as having a friend act as a cover if the girl's parents showed up. The girl's parents wanted to ensure that a parent was always home and that the teens were supervised. However, the author didn't follow through on that and instead gave their son space, which they believe is important for his autonomy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, they're protecting their son's privacy and autonomy, which is a valid concern. But the girl's parents were concerned about their daughter's safety and well-being, and the author didn't respect their wishes by lying. \n\nThe author's intentions might be good, but by lying to the girl's parents and not informing them about their son's behavior, they could be seen as undermining the parents' authority and potentially putting the girl in a risky situation. Even though the author has talked to their son about consent and safety, the girl's parents have a right to know about their daughter's activities, especially since she's a minor. \n\nSo, while the author's stance on their son's autonomy makes sense, they might have overstepped by not considering the other parents' perspective and not being honest about their son's actions. This could be seen as putting their own child's privacy above another child's safety, which might make them at fault.\n"
