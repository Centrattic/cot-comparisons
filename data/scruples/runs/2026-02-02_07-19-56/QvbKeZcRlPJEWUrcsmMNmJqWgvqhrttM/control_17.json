They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The parents are controlling and have a lot of rules about their daughter's interactions with the son. The author's son and the girlfriend are already sexually active, and the author wanted to give them privacy. They even coordinated with a friend to lie if the other parents showed up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, 16-year-olds are legally allowed to consent to sexual activity, so the author's son and his girlfriend might be within their rights. The author is a parent, so their role is to protect their child and perhaps set boundaries. However, the girlfriend's parents have their own rules, which they enforce. The author didn't want to interfere with the other parents' authority, but they decided to give their son privacy anyway.\n\nThe author's actions include lying about being home and arranging a cover. The parents of the girlfriend might feel that the author is overstepping by not enforcing their rules and by deceiving them. On the other hand, the author might argue that they are protecting their son's autonomy and privacy, which is a parent's right. \n\nIs lying to another parent a problem? The author didn't inform the girlfriend's parents about their plans, which could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of cooperation. However, the author's main responsibility is to their own son, not the daughter. The girlfriend's parents have their own parenting style, and the author is making decisions based on their own beliefs about their son's rights. \n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between respecting the other parents' wishes and protecting one's own child's privacy. The author's actions might be seen as respecting their son's agency, which is important. But lying to another parent could be problematic, especially if it leads to situations that the other parents disapprove of. \n\nIn terms of guilt, the author feels conflicted. They believe their own parents were too strict, so they're trying to be more lenient. However, lying to another parent's face, even if it's for their own child's benefit, could be considered wrong because it deceives the other family. \n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't directly lie to the girlfriend's parents. They just didn't correct a potential misunderstanding if the parents showed up. The friend was supposed to cover for them, but it wasn't needed. So maybe the lie wasn't directly to the parents but more of a passive deception. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are driven by their parenting choices, but the deception part (lying or covering up) might be what's in question. If the parents had asked directly, the author could have been honest about their approach. Instead, they created a scenario where they could mislead the other parents. That seems like a lie by omission or a plan to deceive, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they intentionally lied to another parent's family. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because they were protecting their son's privacy. It's a bit of a gray area, but the act of lying to the other parents is a key point here. The author made decisions about another family's child without consulting them, which could be seen as overstepping. However, since the author's own child is involved, they might feel it's their right to protect their son's autonomy. \n\nI think the key issue is the deception. The author didn't tell the truth to the girlfriend's parents when they called, instead letting their friend lie. That's a direct lie. Even if the author's intentions are good, the action of lying is ethically problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
