They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The scenario involves the author's son, who is 16, dating a girl with overbearing parents. The parents have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, checking on the couple, and controlling their interactions. The parents called the author's house, but she wasn't there, so they left messages. The author's husband agreed to have a parent home at all times. However, the author actually allowed her son and his girlfriend privacy, even going as far as to have a friend pretend to be a cousin if the parents showed up. The author is now questioning if she was wrong to make that choice regarding someone else's child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. Their rules are strict and seem to be about controlling their daughter's behavior. The author's son is 16, an age where many teens are exploring relationships. The author believes in giving her son privacy and autonomy, having discussed consent and safe practices with him. She made a decision that her son and his girlfriend should have privacy as long as they consented and used protection. However, this decision was made without considering the other parents' wishes, essentially lying about their supervision.\n\nLegally, the author is a parent of her son, so she has the right to make decisions regarding his upbringing and privacy. However, the girlfriend's parents are the ones who set the rules for their own home. By allowing their daughter to be in a situation where she might be unsupervised, the author could be seen as overstepping, especially if the parents had specific concerns about their daughter's safety. Ethically, there's a conflict between respecting another family's rules and trusting her own child's judgment.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as a breach of trust with the girlfriend's parents, who expected strict supervision. However, the author's reasoning is that the parents are too controlling, and she trusts her son's maturity. The fact that the couple is already sexually active suggests that the parents' rules might not be effective in preventing that, so the author's approach allows for more open communication and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't consult the girlfriend's parents, leading to a potential safety concern. Even though the parents might be overbearing, the author's actions could put the girlfriend in a vulnerable situation if there were any issues. The lie about having a cousin there could be seen as deceptive, even if it wasn't necessary in the end.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is responsible for her son, not the daughter. However, by allowing the daughter to be unsupervised in her home, she's not considering the parents' wishes. The author might be right in supporting her son's autonomy, but the ethical dilemma is whether she should respect the other parents' boundaries.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the answer hinges on respecting others' parental rights versus her own parenting style, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author made decisions that contradicted the girlfriend's parents' explicit requests without their consent, some might say she's in the wrong for not honoring their wishes. Others might side with her for protecting her son's autonomy and recognizing the controlling nature of the girlfriend's parents.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the parents wanted strict supervision and she lied about that, she might be in the wrong for not following their rules, even if she disagrees with them. However, the parents are the ones controlling their daughter's environment, and the author might feel she can't enforce their rules on her son. It's a tricky balance between respecting different parenting styles and ensuring the safety of both teens.\n\nIn the end, the author is prioritizing her son's privacy and autonomy, which is valid, but she might have neglected the parents' rights to set rules for their own home and children. So, there's a case for both sides, but since the parents explicitly asked for supervision and the author lied about complying, that could be seen as being in the wrong.\n"
