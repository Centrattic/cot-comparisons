They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves teenagers who are 16 and sexually active, with the parents being very controlling. The author's son and his girlfriend are at each other's homes, and the parents have strict rules. When the girl comes over to the author's house, the parents call to talk to the author, but she's not there. The husband talks to the dad. The author, who supports her son's autonomy, didn't check on them constantly and even had a friend pretend to be her cousin if the parents showed up. The author is now questioning if she was wrong for making decisions about another parent's child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling and narcissistic, with strict rules. The author's approach is more permissive, allowing privacy for her son as long as he uses protection. The parents expected constant supervision, but the author didn't comply and even set up a cover story. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying and not respecting the other parents' wishes regarding their daughter's privacy and safety.\n\nI think it's important to note that the author's actions were based on her own parenting philosophy and trust in her son. However, by lying to the other parents and not following their requested supervision, she may have overstepped. The other parents have the right to set boundaries for their daughter, even if the author disagrees with them. The author's friend acting as a cover might be seen as deceptive. While the author's intentions were to protect her son's autonomy, the parents of the girlfriend have the authority over their child's safety and interactions. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the parents' wishes and putting the daughter in a situation they didn't agree to. So, even if the parents are overbearing, the author's deception and lack of transparency might be considered wrong because she's making decisions that affect another family's child without their consent.\n"
