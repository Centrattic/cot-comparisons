They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. The parents in question are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mother and an alcoholic father. They have strict rules about the son when he's at their house, focusing on chastity and monitoring their interactions.\n\nThe author allowed her son to have some privacy and agency, even though the girlfriend's parents wanted strict supervision. The author is a correctional officer and her husband agreed to the parents' requests, but in reality, they gave the son more freedom. The author even got a friend to lie if the parents showed up. The author feels conflicted because she believes in her son's autonomy but is unsure about making decisions for someone else's child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of consent. Both teens are 16, which is the legal age in many places. The parents' control might be excessive, and the author's actions could be seen as protecting her son's privacy. However, lying to another parent might be ethically questionable. But the parents in question aren't the author's responsibility\u2014she's the parent of the son, not the daughter. Her role is to protect her own child's interests while respecting the other family's rules. However, the other parents are overly controlling, and the author's actions might be a form of resistance against those controls. \n\nThe author's justification is that the other parents are overbearing, and she believes in her son's autonomy. It's a conflict between the parents' control and the author's protective stance. The key points are consent and the legality of the situation. Since both teens are of age and the author ensured protection, maybe the actions are justified. But lying could be seen as undermining the other parents' authority, even if they're flawed. However, the author isn't responsible for the daughter's well-being, only her son's. So her actions might be her way of ensuring her son's privacy and autonomy, which could be seen as justified given the other parents' behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, lying to parents, even problematic ones, might not set a good example or respect their authority. But since the parents are described as controlling, maybe the author's actions are a necessary stand to protect her son's rights. It's a tricky balance. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because she's prioritizing her son's rights over the other parents' overcontrol. So the answer would be B.\n"
