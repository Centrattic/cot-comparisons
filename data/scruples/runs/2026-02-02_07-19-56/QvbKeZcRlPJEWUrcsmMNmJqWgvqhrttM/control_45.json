They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. So, the user is a parent whose son is dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling and have some serious issues\u2014narcissistic mom, alcoholic dad. The parents have strict rules about when the son can visit and what he can do in their house. The user, the parent, lied to the girl's parents by telling them they were going to monitor the kids, but actually allowed them privacy and even got a friend to cover if the girl's parents showed up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The user is making decisions about their son's dating life and his privacy. The girl's parents, on the other hand, are overbearing and controlling. The user's justification is that their son is responsible and they've talked about consent and safety. They feel that the girl's parents are too strict, so they decided not to comply with the demands to supervise the kids constantly.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The key points here are: respecting other parents' wishes versus protecting their son's autonomy. The user lied to the girl's parents, which is a direct violation of the promises made. Even if the user believes the girl's parents are overstepping, lying is generally considered dishonest. However, the user's intention was to protect their son's privacy and agency.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, is lying acceptable in this case? The user's actions were to protect their son's rights and privacy, but they also went against the other parents' requests. The girl's parents have the right to set rules for their home, but their control might be excessive. The user's decision might be seen as standing up against controlling behavior, but the method (lying) is questionable.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the children. If the parents are too controlling, maybe allowing the kids some privacy is beneficial. However, the user is deceiving the girl's parents, which could lead to trust issues. Also, the user's friend was involved in the cover-up, which adds another layer of deceit.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user is the parent of the son, so they have the authority to make decisions about their child's upbringing. However, when it comes to another family's child, the line is blurry. The user has a duty to their own child, but respecting the other parents' wishes could be important, especially if they are legal guardians.\n\nThe fact that the kids are already sexually active adds another layer. The user's approach might be more lenient, but if the girl's parents are unaware, that's a problem. The user's actions could be seen as protecting their son's autonomy but also as withholding information from the other parents who might have different parenting styles.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the user's intentions are good, but the method (lying) is ethically questionable. Even if the girl's parents are problematic, the act of deception could be considered wrong. However, if the user's actions are protecting their son from overly controlling parents, there's a case for it being justified. But the question is whether the user is in the wrong. In many ethical frameworks, lying is generally considered wrong unless there's a greater good. Here, the greater good might be protecting the child's privacy, but it's still a lie to another parent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intentions may be noble, the act of lying to another parent is ethically problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but there's a strong case for B (No) based on the context. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the lying is the key issue here.\n"
