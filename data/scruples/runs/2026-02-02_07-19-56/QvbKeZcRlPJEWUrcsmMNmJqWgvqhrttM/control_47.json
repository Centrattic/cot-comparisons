They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a parent (the author) lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The key points are:\n\n- The son and the girlfriend are both 16, which is under 18 in most places, so minors.\n- The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the son's behavior when visiting their daughter.\n- The author's son is already sexually active, and the author is more permissive, allowing privacy and using protection.\n- When the girlfriend comes to their house for the first time, the author's husband told the girl's dad they'd have a parent present, but the author actually arranged for a friend to pretend to be a cousin in case the parents showed up. The author didn't check on them constantly and trusted the son and girlfriend's decisions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author lied to the other parents. The husband agreed to have a parent present, but the author instead got a friend to pretend to be a cousin. That's a lie. Lying is generally unethical, especially when it involves other people's children.\n\nThe author believes in their son's autonomy and has discussed consent and safety with him. However, the other parents are making their own decisions about their daughter's safety. The author's decision to deceive those parents could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author believes their approach is better, they had no right to make decisions about another parent's child without their consent. The fact that the other parents are described as controlling doesn't justify the lie; the author's actions could compromise the safety of both teens if not properly supervised.\n\nAdditionally, the author's son is already sexually active. While the author trusts their son, the girl's parents were trying to enforce their rules for their daughter's protection. The author's actions might leave the girl vulnerable if the parents' rules are in place for her well-being. The author's lie could put the girl at risk and undermine the parents' attempts to protect her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is standing by their belief in their son's autonomy and privacy. There's a valid argument that teenagers should have some independence, especially if they're making responsible decisions. However, the key issue here is the deception towards another parent. Even if the author's intentions were good, lying to another parent about supervision is a breach of trust and could be harmful.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author did lie to another parent's face about supervising their child. That's a clear ethical breach, regardless of the reason. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
