They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. So the situation is: the son and his 16-year-old girlfriend are both teenagers, and her parents are controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author's son visits the girl's house often, and the parents have strict rules about what they can and can't do. The mom even changes the rules, like allowing him in the room but not on the bed, then later on the bed but not under the covers. The parents want to ensure that their daughter isn't being pressured into sexual activity.\n\nNow, the girl comes to the author's house for the first time. The mom calls the night before, but the author is working (as a correctional officer) and can't answer. The son suggests the husband talk to the mom, but she insists on speaking to the author. Then the dad calls the husband and says they want to make sure a parent is home at all times and that the author will monitor the kids. The husband agrees. However, the author actually gives the son more privacy, telling him that as long as the girl is willing and they use protection, they can have privacy. The author even asks a friend to pretend to be their cousin if the girl's parents show up without warning, which didn't happen. The dad eventually picks up the girl.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they believe in their son's agency and that the other parents are too controlling. They wonder if they were wrong to lie or if the guilt is unnecessary. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. The parents have the right to set rules for their own child, but the author's actions might interfere. The author is lying to the girlfriend's parents about monitoring their daughter, which could be seen as deceptive. Even though they trust their son and have talked about consent and protection, they're making decisions about another parent's child without their consent. That's a key point. \n\nAlso, the fact that the son and girlfriend are already sexually active might make the author's decision to not monitor them seem like they're enabling behavior the other parents are against. The author's friend pretending to be a cousin is another layer of deception. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that their son is responsible and that the girlfriend's parents are overbearing. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents' control is a factor, but the author is lying to them. If the parents believe the author is monitoring their daughter when they aren't, that's a breach of trust, even if the author thinks the parents are wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the perspective. If the author is intentionally deceiving the other parents to avoid their control, does that make them at fault? Even if they believe in their son's autonomy, they should probably communicate honestly with the other parents. Lying, even for what the author sees as a good reason, could be considered wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they are the parent of their own child and have the right to decide how to handle their son's relationships. However, the girlfriend's parents are not the ones being lied to, but they were told that the author would monitor the daughter, which they didn't. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially since they're making decisions about another family's child. \n\nSo, the ethical issue here is about honesty and respecting the other parents' wishes. The author agreed to monitor the daughter but didn't, leading to a lie of omission. Even if they think the other parents are wrong, breaking their agreement could be considered in the wrong. The guilt might be justified if the author is violating trust. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to manage their household and their son's privacy. The other parents are being controlling, and the author's actions are protecting their son's autonomy. However, the act of lying is still questionable. \n\nThe key points are: the author agreed to monitor the daughter but didn't, lied about it, and had a friend pretend to be a relative. The parents of the girl might feel betrayed if they found out. But the author's motivation is trust in their son and disapproval of the other parents' control. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, lying is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. The author's decision to not inform the other parents about the alternative arrangements (their friend) might be the main issue. So, the answer could be A (yes) because they lied. But some might argue B (no) because they have the right to protect their son. However, since they made a promise to the other parents and then broke it, that's a problem. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for lying to the girl's parents and not following through on their agreement, even if they disagree with the parents' approach. Honesty is important in such situations, and deception is ethically problematic.\n"
