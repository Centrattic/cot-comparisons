They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's son is 16 and dating a girl whose parents are described as controlling, with the mom being narcissistic and the dad an alcoholic. The parents have strict rules about their daughter's chastity, checking in on the couple even in the son's room when he's at their house. The author's son is allowed to visit her house but under various conditions that change. Now, the girl comes over to the author's house for the first time. The girl's parents called to talk, but the author wasn't home. The husband spoke to the dad and agreed to the parents' conditions. However, the author had different intentions: they wanted to give the couple privacy if they were using protection, and they even asked a friend to pose as a cousin in case the girl's parents showed up. The parents didn't actually come, so the plan wasn't used. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to make that choice, especially regarding the other parents' child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author's son is an adult in terms of age (16 in many states is an adult), and the parents are being overly controlling. The author believes their son should have autonomy and privacy. They made a judgment call based on their own parenting style and their son's maturity. They even took steps to ensure the couple's privacy, which might be seen as protecting their son's relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making decisions about another person's child. The girl's parents might feel that the author overstepped by not following their rules and potentially putting their daughter in a situation they find inappropriate. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the girl's parents' authority and possibly exposing their daughter to risks the parents wanted to avoid. Even if the author's intentions are good, they are making a choice that affects another family's child without consulting them. This could be considered a breach of trust or responsibility, especially since the parents had specific concerns about their daughter's chastity and safety.\n\nAlso, the author's friend posing as a cousin is a lie that could have legal or ethical implications if discovered. While it wasn't needed, the fact that they planned it shows a willingness to deceive, which could be problematic. The author might be prioritizing their son's desires over the girl's parents' wishes, which could lead to conflicts or harm the girl's well-being if she felt uncomfortable with the situation.\n\nHowever, the girl's parents are described as controlling and possibly overbearing. The author might be trying to counteract that by giving their son more freedom. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to make decisions about the girl's upbringing and privacy. Since the girl is another person's child, the author's actions could be seen as interfering in a way that's not appropriate.\n\nIn many cases, parents are responsible for their own children's upbringing, but when it involves another family's child, the boundaries are less clear. The author might be right in supporting their son's autonomy, but they might be wrong in not considering the girl's parents' wishes and the girl's own consent and comfort level. The girl might have her own feelings about privacy and relationships that weren't taken into account.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since they made decisions that directly affect another family's child without their consent. Even if the parents are controlling, the author's deception and actions could be viewed as ethically wrong because they're making choices about someone else's child's life.\n"
