They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for lying to the girlfriend's parents. The author's son is 16, as is the girl, and their parents are described as very controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The parents have strict rules about when the son can be at their house and what they can do there. The author and husband, on the other hand, are more lenient. The key point is that the author lied to the girlfriend's parents by pretending that they would be present and monitoring their teens, when in reality they had plans to leave and even involved a friend to cover for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, 16 is the age of consent, so the teens being sexually active could be legal. However, the parents' control and the author's decision to deceive them is the main issue. The author's actions were to protect their son's autonomy, which they believe is important. But lying to another parent about their child's safety could have serious consequences. The girlfriend's parents might feel violated if they discovered the deception, especially if they were trying to protect their daughter from something they consider inappropriate. \n\nThe author's justification is that the parents are overbearing and the teens are already sexually active. However, the author didn't consult the girlfriend's parents but made decisions on their behalf. Even though the author has a more open approach with their son, they still had a responsibility to the other family. The fact that they involved a friend to cover for them adds another layer of deceit. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, honesty is usually valued in interactions between parents, even if you disagree with each other's parenting styles. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the other parents' authority and potentially putting the girlfriend in a risky situation if the author's plans had gone awry. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's son has his own agency, and the parents might be overly controlling. The author might argue that they were protecting their son's privacy and autonomy. However, the deception could have led to serious repercussions if the other parents had found out, especially given the existing issues with the parents (alcoholism, narcissism). \n\nConsidering all this, while the author's intentions were to support their son's independence, the act of lying to another parent about their child's safety and supervision is problematic. It's a breach of trust and could have put the girlfriend in a vulnerable position if the cover-up had been needed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the deception, even if their motives were to protect their son's autonomy.\n"
