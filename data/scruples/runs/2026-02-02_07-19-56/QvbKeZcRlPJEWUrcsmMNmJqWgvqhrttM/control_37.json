They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the son and his girlfriend are both 16. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the son's visits, checking in on them, and varying curfews. The parents recently wanted to talk to the author (a correctional officer) but couldn't reach them. When the girlfriend's dad spoke to the husband, they were told that a parent would be home to supervise. However, the author actually planned for the couple to have privacy with a friend covering if needed. The parents' rules are seen as overbearing, and the author believes in giving their son agency.\n\nNow, the key points here are about parental rights and the ethics of lying to other parents. The author's actions were to protect their son's privacy and autonomy, but this involved misleading the girlfriend's parents. The question is whether the author is wrong for that.\n\nOn one hand, the author is a parent advocating for their child's rights, which they have every right to do. The girlfriend's parents are portrayed as controlling, and the author might feel they are protecting their son from an oppressive environment. However, lying to another parent about supervision could be seen as deceitful. The parents of the girlfriend had a right to believe that their daughter's activities were being monitored as they agreed. The author's friend pretending to be a cousin could be a breach of trust.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's intentions were to respect their son's privacy and autonomy, which is a valid parental stance. The girlfriend's parents' extreme control might justify the author's actions, but the lie could still be problematic. The author didn't deceive the girlfriend's parents directly but let the husband agree to supervision while planning otherwise. This could lead to a breach of trust if discovered, but since the parents picked up their daughter before any issues arose, maybe the deception wasn't harmful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were based on their parenting philosophy and protecting their son. However, lying to another parent, even if the reasoning is sound, might still be ethically questionable. The line is blurry here. The author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their child's rights, but the act of lying could be seen as morally wrong. However, given the context of the controlling parents, it's more about protecting their son's autonomy, so maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer. But some might argue that lying is wrong regardless. It's a tough call, but the answer likely hinges on the justification provided.\n"
