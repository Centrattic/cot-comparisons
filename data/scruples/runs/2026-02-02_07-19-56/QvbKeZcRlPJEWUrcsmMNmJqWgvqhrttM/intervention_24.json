They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves teenagers and their parents' control issues. The author's son is 16, and the girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author allowed their son and the girl some privacy, even though the girlfriend's parents wanted strict supervision. The author also had a friend pretend to be their cousin in case the girlfriend's parents showed up.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong in not being truthful with the girlfriend's parents. The author justified their actions by believing in their son's privacy and autonomy, but they lied to the other parents about monitoring the teenagers. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to decide if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to protect their son's privacy and agency, which they believe is important. However, they lied to the girlfriend's parents about their intentions. Lies, even if well-intentioned, can be problematic. The parents of the girlfriend likely wanted to maintain control and ensure their daughter's chastity, which the author directly opposed by giving them privacy. While the author's own values are valid, lying to the other parents might be crossing a line, especially since they're not the guardians of the girl. The author's actions could undermine the girlfriend's parents' authority and possibly put the girl in a situation they weren't comfortable with.\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's parents are portrayed as overbearing and controlling. The author might have felt that the parents' demands were unreasonable and wanted to protect their son's relationship. However, the ethical question is whether it's right to deceive others regarding their child's safety and well-being. Even if the parents are problematic, lying to them could be seen as interfering in their parenting decisions. The author's justification is that the teenagers are already sexually active, but that doesn't necessarily mean the parents should be misled about supervision.\n\nThe key points are consent and deception. The author's own son's autonomy is one thing, but the girl is another person whose parents are being lied to. The author isn't the legal guardian of the girl, so their responsibility is to their son and their own household. However, by allowing privacy and deceiving the girlfriend's parents, the author might be enabling a situation that the girl's parents aren't aware of, which could be risky for the girl if she's not making fully informed decisions. But given the parents' controlling nature, maybe the author felt that lying was the only way to protect the relationship from being ruined by the parents' interference.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, lying is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. The author's actions were based on their own values and their son's needs, but the dishonesty is the main issue here. The parents of the girlfriend have the right to know about their daughter's activities, even if they are overbearing. By lying, the author is preventing those parents from making informed decisions about their daughter's safety. Even if the parents are flawed, the ethical stance of honesty is important.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's lie to the girlfriend's parents is the main point of contention. While their intentions might be good, the act of lying is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
