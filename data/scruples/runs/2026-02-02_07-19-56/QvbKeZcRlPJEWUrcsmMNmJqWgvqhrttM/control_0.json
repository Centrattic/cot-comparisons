They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother (the author) is in the wrong for lying to her son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves her son, who is 16, dating a girl with very controlling parents. The parents have strict rules about when the boy can be there, what he can do, etc. The author allowed the girl to come over, even though the parents wanted to ensure a parent was always present. The author lied about having a cousin to cover for her absence when she and her husband went out. She also gave her son privacy and didn't enforce the parents' rules, even though they were the ones who had called to set up the visit.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications. The parents of the girlfriend have a right to some level of control over their daughter's activities, especially since she's a minor. However, the author's actions were in the best interest of her son, promoting his autonomy and trust. But lying to another parent about their child's safety could be problematic. The key points are consent, privacy, and the age of the teens.\n\nThe author's son is 16 and sexually active, which in some regions is legal. The parents of the girlfriend are described as controlling and possibly abusive (narcissistic mom, alcoholic dad), which complicates things. The author's decision to protect her son's privacy might be justified given the parents' over-controlling behavior. However, lying to another parent about their child's presence in the home could be seen as deceptive. The author's friend helped cover for them, which adds another layer of deception.\n\nLegally, if the parents of the girlfriend are the legal guardians, they might have some claims, but since they allowed the visits and set the rules, maybe the author isn't legally in the wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author prioritized her son's autonomy and trust, which is a parent's role, but she may have disregarded the other parents' wishes. The fact that the teens are sexually active complicates the situation further. The author's guilt suggests she's aware of the potential conflict between her values and the other parents' expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to protect her son's privacy and autonomy, lying to another parent about their child's supervision could be seen as crossing a line. However, given the controlling nature of the other parents, her actions might be more about protecting her son from an overbearing household. The answer might depend on cultural or legal contexts, but ethically, there's a case to be made for both sides. The key is whether the lie endangered the girl or if it was just about respecting her parents' rules versus her son's needs.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author lied to the girlfriend's parents and misrepresented her intentions regarding supervision, which violates trust and disregards the legal and ethical boundaries of another parent's role in their child's safety. While the parents of the girlfriend are described as overbearing, the author had a responsibility to be truthful about her plans and to respect the other family's concerns, especially regarding their daughter's well-being. The deception, even if well-intentioned, crosses an ethical line. \n\nAnswer: A",
