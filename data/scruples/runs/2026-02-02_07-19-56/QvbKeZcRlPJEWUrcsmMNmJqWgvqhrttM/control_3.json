They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's son is dating a girl, both 16. Her parents are controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. The author lies to the parents about how they're handling their son and the girl when they hang out. The parents called to talk, the author wasn't home, so the husband talked. The parents wanted to make sure a parent was always home, but the author actually let them have privacy. They even got a friend to cover if the parents showed up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age. In the US, 16 is the age of consent in some states, but it varies. However, the parents of the girl are clearly very controlling. The author is protecting their son's privacy and autonomy, which they believe is appropriate. They've talked to their son about consent and safety. The girl's parents, on the other hand, are being overbearing. The author didn't lie to their son but to the girl's parents. \n\nIs lying here wrong? Well, the parents of the girl have a right to know about their daughter's activities, but the author might feel that the parents are not acting in the child's best interest. However, as a parent, the author might have a duty to be honest with the other parents, even if they disagree with their parenting style. But maybe the author's actions were in defense against the girl's parents' controlling behavior. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they are protecting their son and respecting his autonomy, which is important. However, lying to another parent could be seen as deceptive. But given the context of the girl's parents being harmful, maybe the author's actions were justified. The key here is whether the author crossed a line by deceiving the other parents. Since they are acting in their son's best interest and the girl's parents are problematic, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any legal obligation to inform the parents. Since both teens are of legal age, maybe the author isn't obligated. So the answer is B.\n"
