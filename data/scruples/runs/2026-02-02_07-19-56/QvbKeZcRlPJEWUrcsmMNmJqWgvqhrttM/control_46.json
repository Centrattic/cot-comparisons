They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their son's girlfriend's parents.\n\nFirst, the situation: The son and his girlfriend are both 16 and have been dating for four months. The girlfriend's parents are described as controlling, with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad. They have strict rules about the boy's behavior when visiting their home, changing the rules often. The parents contacted the author to discuss their daughter visiting the author's home, insisting that a parent be present at all times. The author's husband agreed, but the author didn't actually enforce that. Instead, they allowed the teens privacy if they used protection and even had a friend pretend to be a cousin to cover if the parents showed up. The author feels conflicted but believes the parents are overbearing.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The core issue is lying to another parent about their child's safety and supervision. The author is making a judgment call about their son's autonomy and privacy, which is their right as a parent. However, by lying to the girlfriend's parents about having constant supervision, the author is potentially misleading them. The girlfriend's parents have their own parenting style, albeit controlling, and the author's actions could be seen as undermining their authority. \n\nBut, the parents in question are not exactly paragons of healthy parenting. Their controlling behavior might lead the author to feel that their own approach is necessary. The teens are already sexually active, which the author is aware of and has discussed with their son about consent and protection. The author's decision to allow privacy is based on trust and education rather than strict control.\n\nHowever, lying to another set of parents about supervision could have risks. If the girlfriend's parents found out, it might cause conflict or put the teens in a worse situation. The author's actions could be seen as deceptive, even if their intentions are good. But since the parents are overbearing, maybe the author felt it was necessary to protect their son's autonomy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. Lying is generally unethical, but the context of controlling parents complicates things. The author's actions are more about protecting their son's agency, but they crossed a line by lying. However, the parents' controlling nature might justify the author's actions as a form of resistance against toxic parenting. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the lie is considered in the wrong. If the author's intent was to protect their child's well-being in a situation where the other parents are harmful, maybe they're not in the wrong. But lying is still a breach of trust. However, since the parents are not the author's responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own child's needs. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
