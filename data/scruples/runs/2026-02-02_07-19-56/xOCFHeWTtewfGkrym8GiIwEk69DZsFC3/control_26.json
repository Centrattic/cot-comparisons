The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to match in various aspects, including hairstyles. The author has naturally straight, short hair, which doesn't hold curls well. She's offered to use clip-ins, but the bride is insisting on growing her hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The bride is trying to create a cohesive look for her wedding, which is a big deal for her. It's important for her to have everything match. But the author has valid reasons for not wanting to grow her hair. Her hair type is different, and she's already had issues with styling it. Also, she has allergies to jewelry and makeup, which adds to her stress.\n\nThe bride's control over every detail is causing anxiety for the author. The author is trying to accommodate where she can, like discussing the makeup artist about allergies and suggesting alternatives for the jewelry. But the bride isn't being flexible, which is making the author feel like an outsider in the bridal party.\n\nThe key points here are the bride's insistence on a specific look versus the author's comfort and health issues. The author isn't being unreasonable by sticking to her natural hair type, especially since she's already offered an alternative (clip-ins). The bride's behavior seems more extreme, turning into what's described as a \"bridezilla\" scenario. The author's anxiety is justified given the bride's high control and lack of consideration for her needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to maintain her comfort and health while suggesting alternatives. The bride is the one being inflexible. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
