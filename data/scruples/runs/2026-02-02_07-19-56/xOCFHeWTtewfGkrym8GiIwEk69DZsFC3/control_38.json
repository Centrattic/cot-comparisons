The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for not growing their hair for the friend's wedding. The friend is making all the bridesmaids match in dresses, shoes, bags, jewelry, etc., including the hairstyle. The bride wants the same look, but the author has naturally straight, short hair that doesn't hold curls well. They offered to use clip-ins, but the bride seems resistant, making the author feel like a Debbie Downer. Also, the author has skin allergies and can't wear costume jewelry, and they're worried about makeup causing a reaction. The author feels their anxiety and body shame are being triggered by the bride's control over every detail.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The bride has a vision for her wedding, which is common and understandable. She's asking the bridesmaids to coordinate their appearances, which often includes hair and makeup. However, the author has valid concerns about their hair type and allergies. They've already proposed solutions like clip-ins and alternative jewelry, but the bride is not accepting them, making the author feel pressured.\n\nThe key points here are the bride's control over the details and the author's health and comfort. The author isn't refusing to participate; they're suggesting alternatives that work for their specific needs. The bride's insistence on growing hair might not consider that the author's hair naturally doesn't hold styles, making clip-ins a reasonable solution. Also, the author's allergies are a health concern that should be addressed, not dismissed. \n\nIn terms of social norms, weddings often require some coordination among the bridal party, but there's usually flexibility for individual differences. The bride's approach here seems more rigid and demanding, which might be the main issue. The author is being considerate by offering alternatives but is feeling shamed for not conforming. \n\nI should also consider the friendship aspect. The author mentions they've supported each other through tough times, so the bride should ideally be understanding. However, the bride's behavior now seems different, possibly due to the stress of planning a wedding. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're standing up for their comfort and health, which are important. The bride is the one being inflexible and making the author feel bad. The author's reasons are legitimate, so they're not being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
