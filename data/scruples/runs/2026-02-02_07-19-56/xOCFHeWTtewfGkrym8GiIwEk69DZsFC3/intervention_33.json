The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for the friend's wedding. The situation is that the bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, but the author has naturally straight, short hair and can't curl it. They offered clip-ins, but the bride is pushing for growing the hair. The author also has allergies to jewelry and makeup, which makes them feel like they're not fitting in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride is enforcing a strict uniformity on the bridesmaids, which the author is resisting because of their hair type and allergies. The author feels their individuality is being suppressed, leading to anxiety. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the bride has the right to have a cohesive look for her wedding, but she also needs to consider the comfort and health of her bridesmaids. The author's refusal isn't just about hair; it's about their physical limitations and health issues. They've tried to compromise with clip-ins but aren't being accepted. This could indicate the bride is being overly controlling, not considering others' needs.\n\nThe author's anxiety and body image issues are valid and shouldn't be dismissed. The wedding should be about the couple, not forcing others to change significantly. The bride's behavior as a \"bridezilla\" suggests she might be overstepping, making the author feel unappreciated and uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's alternatives (studs, talking to the makeup artist) were not accepted, which adds to the problem. The author isn't refusing to participate but is seeking a solution that respects their health and personal preferences. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the bride is being unreasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
