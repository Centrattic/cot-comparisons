The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing to grow her hair for the wedding. The person is a bridesmaid and the bride wants all the bridal party to have matching hairstyles. The author has straight, short hair and can't curl it, so she suggests using clip-ins instead. The bride is insisting on growing hair, and the author feels like she's being difficult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The bride is trying to coordinate the look, which includes matching hairstyles. The author's hair doesn't behave the same way, so she's offering an alternative solution. The key issue is whether the author is being unreasonable by not complying with the bride's request. \n\nThe bride's approach seems a bit controlling, especially with the list of matching items. The author has valid reasons: her hair type won't cooperate, and she's already made accommodations for other aspects like jewelry. The fact that the author has tried to work with the bride (suggesting clips, talking to the makeup artist) shows she's not being difficult. \n\nThe bride's insistence on growing hair might be causing the author anxiety and body image issues, which is significant. The story mentions that the author is already feeling like a Debbie Downer and that the bride's behavior has changed since engagement. This could indicate that the bride is overstepping, not the author. \n\nIn terms of fairness, while the bride has a vision, it's important to consider the comfort and well-being of the bridal party. The author isn't refusing to comply entirely; she's offering a practical alternative. The bride's refusal to consider clip-ins might be the problem here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own needs and finding a compromise solution. The bride is being controlling, which is causing stress. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
