The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and the bride wants everyone to have the same hairstyle. The author has straight, short hair and can't curl it, so they're offering clip-ins instead. They also mention other issues like jewelry allergies and makeup allergies, which they've tried to address but feel dismissed. The bride is being very controlling now that she's engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is standing up for their own preferences and physical limitations. They have a valid reason why their hair doesn't hold curls and offer an alternative. The bride is enforcing a strict vision, which might be reasonable, but the author is feeling pressured and it's affecting their anxiety and body image. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Maybe not. They are trying to compromise by using clip-ins. The bride's demands might be excessive, especially if they're making the author uncomfortable. Also, the author has already offered solutions to other issues (earrings, makeup), but the bride isn't being accommodating. \n\nThe friend's behavior as a bride is coming across as controlling, which isn't the author's fault. The author's rights to their own body and comfort are important. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They're advocating for themselves reasonably and the bride's demands might be crossing a line.\n"
