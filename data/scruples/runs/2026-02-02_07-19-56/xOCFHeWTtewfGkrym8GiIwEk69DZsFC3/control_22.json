The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The situation is that the bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, matching other elements like dresses, shoes, etc. The author has straight, short hair, and the bride is suggesting they grow it. The author prefers using clip-in hair extensions instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The bride has a vision for the wedding, and wants the bridal party to look cohesive. That's common, I think. But the author has valid reasons: their hair is straight and doesn't hold curls, they've had issues with that in the past, and they feel their short hair is liberating. Also, they have allergies to the jewelry and makeup, which they've tried to address by suggesting alternatives but feel unhelpful.\n\nThe key points here are the bride's desire for a unified look versus the author's personal comfort and health. The author is making reasonable compromises, like using clip-ins and discussing makeup allergies. The bride's insistence on growing out hair could be adding unnecessary stress. The author's anxiety and body image issues are being triggered by the bride's control, which might be a sign of bridezilla behavior. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they are trying to accommodate by using clip-ins. The bride is the one setting the vision, but the author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially regarding their health and personal preferences. The bride should be flexible and consider alternative solutions to achieve unity without forcing the author to change their natural hair. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
