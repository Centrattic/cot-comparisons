The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is a bridesmaid and the bride wants all the bridal party to have the same hairstyle. The author has naturally straight, short hair and the others have curly or black hair. They can't just curl their hair because it's straight and doesn't hold the style, so they offered clip-ins instead. The bride is being controlling, and the author is feeling anxious and like a Debbie Downer.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The bride wants everyone to match, which is common in weddings. But the author has a legitimate reason why they can't do that\u2014straight hair that doesn't hold a curl. They proposed an alternative (clip-ins) to meet the bride's vision. If the bride is pushing back, maybe she's not considering the author's limitations. \n\nAlso, the author has allergies to jewelry and makeup, which they've communicated. The bride seems dismissive of these issues, making the author feel awkward. That's a problem because it's about the author's health and comfort. The bride's control might be going overboard, causing unnecessary stress on the friends. \n\nThe author's main point is that they love their short, straight hair and it's liberating. It's their choice how they present themselves. The bride is asking them to change their natural look for the wedding, but the author has valid reasons to resist. They're trying to compromise by using clip-ins. \n\nSo, the author isn't being unreasonable. The bride is the one exerting too much control here. The author is standing up for their own comfort and health, which is important. Therefore, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They have the right to maintain their own style and health, even if they have to use alternatives to match the bride's request.\n"
