The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a bridesmaid not wanting to grow her hair for the wedding because her friend wants everyone to have the same hairstyle. The bride is pushing for matching hair, but the author has straight, short hair and can't curl it. She offered to use clip-ins, but the bride isn't happy. The author feels like they're being difficult and is struggling with anxiety and body image.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride wants matching hairstyles for the bridal party. The author's hair is naturally straight and short, and she's tried to curl it without success. She's offered alternative solutions like clip-ins, which could work. The bride's control over every detail is making the author anxious. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not growing her hair. The bride is the one setting the requirements, but the author is respecting her body and her past experiences. The bride's approach seems excessive, controlling, and might be causing unnecessary stress. The author is compromising by offering clip-ins, which should meet the bride's desire for a uniform look without forcing a hairstyle that's unmanageable for the author.\n\nAlso, the author has other issues with the bride's demands, like jewelry and makeup, where she's trying to accommodate but feels dismissed. This suggests the bride is being inflexible across multiple aspects. The author is standing up for her own needs and health (allergies) while trying to comply where possible. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person is in the wrong if they're being unreasonable. Here, the author seems reasonable. The bride is the one being controlling and not considering the bridesmaids' comfort and physical limitations. The author isn't refusing to participate; she's offering alternatives. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
