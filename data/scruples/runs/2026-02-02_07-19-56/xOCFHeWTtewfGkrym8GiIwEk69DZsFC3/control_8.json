The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding where the bride has specific style requirements for the bridal party.\n\nFirst, the bride is insisting on a unified look, including matching hairstyles. The author has naturally straight, short hair, which doesn't conform to the others' curly or black hair. They suggest using clip-ins, but the bride isn't accepting that. The author also has allergies to jewelry and makeup, which they've tried to address but feel ignored. The bride is being very controlling, which is stressing the author out.\n\nThe key points here are the bride's demands versus the author's comfort and health. The author is a bridesmaid, which is a supportive role, but the bride's control is affecting the author's anxiety and body image. The author is trying to find solutions (like clip-ins, alternative jewelry) but feels dismissed. The bride's behavior seems to be prioritizing her vision over the comfort of the bridal party, which is a problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The bride's control is excessive, and the author is standing up for their own needs. The author isn't refusing to comply entirely; they're proposing alternatives. The bride's insistence on growing hair seems unreasonable given the author's hair type and past experiences. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're advocating for themselves against unreasonable demands. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
