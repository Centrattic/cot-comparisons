The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to match in various aspects, including hairstyles. The author has naturally straight, short hair and offered to use clip-ins instead of growing it out. They also have allergies that make the chosen jewelry and makeup problematic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She's planning a wedding and wants a cohesive look, which is understandable. Bridesmaids dresses, shoes, etc., are often coordinated. The bride is suggesting the hair growth, but the author is resisting. The author has valid reasons: their hair type doesn't hold curls well, they've accepted their natural hair, and there are allergy concerns. The author isn't refusing to participate but is proposing alternatives.\n\nThe author feels like they're the problem and that their needs are being dismissed. The bride is being controlling, which the author finds overwhelming. The main question is whether the author is wrong for not complying. The key points are mutual respect and compromise. The author is trying to meet halfway by suggesting clip-ins and discussing makeup, which shows willingness to cooperate. The bride's insistence might be overstepping, especially if the author's health is at risk with the jewelry. \n\nIn terms of social norms, weddings are about the couple, but bridesmaids should also have some comfort and dignity. The author isn't being unreasonable by sticking to their boundaries, especially given their allergies and natural hair texture. The bride's control might be the real issue here. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
