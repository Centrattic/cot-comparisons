The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, and the author has straight, short hair that doesn't curl. They offered to use clip-ins, but the bride seems controlling and the author is feeling anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is the bride, so she's in a position of authority over the wedding details. However, the author is a bridesmaid, and the wedding should be about the couple. The bride's control over every detail might be excessive. The author's reasons for not growing their hair are valid\u2014natural hair type, past experiences of not being able to curl it, and current comfort with their style. Also, the author has other issues like allergies, which the bride isn't accommodating. \n\nThe bride's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, prioritizing a uniform look over the comfort and individuality of the bridesmaids. The author is standing up for themselves, which is reasonable. They're not causing harm; they're just asserting their own needs. The bride's reaction might be contributing to the author's anxiety, which is a sign that the bride might be overstepping. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for themselves in a situation where the bride is being too controlling. The answer should be B.\n"
