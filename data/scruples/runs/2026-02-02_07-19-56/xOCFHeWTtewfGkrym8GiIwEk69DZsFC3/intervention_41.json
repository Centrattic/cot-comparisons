The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for their friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and the bride wants everyone to have the same hairstyle. But the author has naturally straight, short hair that doesn't curl well, and they tried clip-ins. They also have allergies to jewelry and makeup, which makes them feel like they're causing issues.\n\nHmm. So, the bride wants matching styles, but the author is resisting. The key points here are about control vs. personal comfort. The bride is trying to enforce a specific look, which the author feels is causing anxiety. The author mentions that their hair doesn't work with the bride's plan and that they've already offered alternatives like clip-ins. But the bride is pushing back, making them feel like they're being uncooperative.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the bride is the one getting married, so she has the right to have some control over the wedding details. But the author is also dealing with personal issues like allergies and the fact that their hair won't cooperate. The author is trying to find compromises, like using clip-ins or talking to the makeup artist. They're not refusing everything; they're just suggesting alternatives. \n\nThe bride's reaction might be more concerning. If she's being too controlling and making the author feel like a burden, that's on her. The author isn't refusing to participate; they're just pushing back on something that's not feasible for them personally. The fact that the author has already been through tough times with the bride suggests they care about the relationship, but the bride's current behavior is creating conflict.\n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is the asshole, I don't think so. They're standing up for their own comfort and health. The bride needs to be more flexible, considering the author's limitations. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
