The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend's wedding where the bride wants all the bridesmaids to have matching hair, but the writer has straight, short hair and refuses to grow it, offering to use clip-ins instead. The bride is being controlling, and the writer is struggling with anxiety because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride is dictating every detail, which might be overstepping. The writer has valid reasons: their hair doesn't curl, they have allergies to jewelry and makeup. They offered alternatives, like clip-ins and discussing the makeup. They're also mentioning anxiety from the bride's control.\n\nThe bride used to be rational but is now very controlling. The writer feels like they're the problem, but they have legitimate issues. The main question is whether the writer is an asshole for not growing their hair. \n\nThe writer isn't being unreasonable. They have health concerns and their hair type makes the bride's request impractical. They're trying to accommodate where possible. The bride's demands might be excessive. The writer's refusal isn't about being difficult but about maintaining their own comfort and health. So, the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
