The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, and the author has straight, short hair. The bride is suggesting the author grow her hair, but the author doesn't want to and prefers to use clip-in extensions. The author mentions issues with allergies to jewelry and makeup, which the bride isn't accommodating. The author feels like they're being unreasonable and is anxious about the bride's control.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair. From the author's perspective, they have valid reasons: their hair type doesn't work well with the styles needed, they have allergies that make some accessories and makeup problematic, and they're feeling pressured. They've tried to offer alternatives, like clip-ins and different earrings, but the bride isn't accepting those. \n\nThe bride's side isn't presented, but weddings often involve a lot of coordination, and maybe the bride feels that uniformity is important for the event. However, the bride is being inflexible and not considering the author's physical limitations (like allergies) and personal preferences. The author is compromising by suggesting clip-ins but the bride isn't accepting that. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a balance between the bride's vision and the author's comfort and health. The author has tried to accommodate while staying true to their preferences. The bride's behavior seems controlling, and the author shouldn't have to change their hair for the wedding, especially when there are alternatives. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the bride is being unreasonable here.\n"
