The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and the bride wants all the bridal party to have the same hairstyle. The author has naturally straight, short hair, which doesn't hold curls, and she's offered to use clip-ins instead. The bride is pushing for growing out hair, and the author is feeling pressured and anxious about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She's organizing a wedding and probably has a vision for how the bridal party should look. She might think uniformity is important for the photos and the overall theme. But the author's hair type is different, and she's already made compromises by using clip-ins. The bride isn't considering that the author's hair just won't hold the style, even with extensions. The author is also dealing with allergies to jewelry and makeup, which the bride isn't being flexible about. That could be a sign of the bride being controlling rather than reasonable.\n\nThe author's reasons are valid. She's had past experiences where her hair didn't hold curls, and she's found peace with her natural hair. Forcing her to grow it might cause unnecessary stress and anxiety. The bride's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting everything perfect, but it's affecting the bridesmaids' well-being. Also, the author is trying to accommodate by discussing makeup allergies and using clip-ins, but the bride isn't being supportive.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't refusing to participate; she's just suggesting an alternative that might work. The bride should be open to solutions that maintain the vision without compromising the bridesmaids' comfort. The author's anxiety is valid, especially if the bride is being overbearing. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The bride needs to adjust her expectations and be more flexible. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
