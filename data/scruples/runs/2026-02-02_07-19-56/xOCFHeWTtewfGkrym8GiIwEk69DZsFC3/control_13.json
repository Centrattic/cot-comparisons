The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for the friend's wedding. The situation is that the bride wants all the bridesmaids to have matching hairstyles, but the author has straight, short hair and can't curl it, so they suggested using clip-ins instead. The author also mentions other issues like allergies to jewelry and makeup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The bride is wanting everyone to look the same, which is common in weddings. But the author has a different hair type that doesn't respond to styling. They tried during adolescence to make it curly but it didn't work. The author's solution is clip-ins, which the bride might not accept. The author feels like they're being difficult because of their allergies and hair issues, leading to anxiety.\n\nIs the author wrong for not growing their hair? Well, the author has valid reasons. Their hair naturally doesn't curl, and they've accepted it. Growing hair takes time and might not even work. The bride's demands are causing stress and body image issues. Also, the author is making reasonable compromises, like suggesting studded earrings or no earrings, and talking to the makeup artist. The bride is being controlling, which is causing the author anxiety.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The bride is the one making excessive demands, not the author. The author is trying to find solutions but is being dismissed. So the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
