The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and the bride wants all the bridal party to have matching hairstyles. The author has straight, short hair and says it doesn't hold curls well. They offered to use clip-ins but the bride is pushing for growing hair. The author also mentions other issues like allergies and feeling controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The bride is organizing the wedding and has a vision, which is common. However, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to change their natural hair. They've tried before and it doesn't work, leading to frustration. Also, they have allergies, which is a health concern. They offered alternatives but the bride isn't accepting them, making the author feel like they're being difficult.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to their natural hair, the bride's control over the wedding, and the impact on the author's anxiety. The bride is being controlling, which might be part of the problem. The author isn't refusing to comply but is suggesting alternatives. The question is whether not growing hair is being an asshole. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person is being unreasonable. The author is standing up for themselves, especially considering their health issues. The bride's insistence on uniformity might be excessive. The author isn't causing harm but is respecting their own needs. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
