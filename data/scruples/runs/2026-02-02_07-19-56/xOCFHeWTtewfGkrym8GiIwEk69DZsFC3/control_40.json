The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have matching hairstyles, but the author has straight hair that doesn't hold curls well. She offered an alternative with clip-ins but the bride seems to be pushing for her to grow her hair. The author also has issues with the jewelry and makeup due to allergies.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the bride's desire for uniformity versus the author's personal comfort and natural hair type. The author's hair is naturally straight and short, and she's tried various methods to curl it without success. That's a valid concern. The bride is being very controlling, which the author mentions is different from her normal self. The author is also standing up for her needs, like her allergies, which could be serious if ignored.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not complying. The bride is asking for a specific look, but the author is providing an alternative that should achieve the same result without changing her hair. The bride's insistence might be unreasonable, especially since the author's hair type is a natural limitation. Also, the bride's control over every detail is causing anxiety for the author, which is a red flag. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's trying to compromise while sticking to her preferences and health needs.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's advocating for herself and finding solutions within the bride's vision without making drastic personal sacrifices. The bride's behavior is more problematic here.\n"
