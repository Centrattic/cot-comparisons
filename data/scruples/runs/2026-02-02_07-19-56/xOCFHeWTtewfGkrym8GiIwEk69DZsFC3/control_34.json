The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and the bride is insisting on a unified look, including matching hairstyles. The author has straight, short hair, and mentions that she tried to curl it in the 90s without success. She offers alternatives like clip-ins but feels her friend is being controlling, leading to anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The bride wants matching hair for the bridal party, which is common but can get over the top. The author has valid reasons: her hair type doesn't work with the desired style, she's suggested alternatives, and she has allergies to jewelry and makeup. She's also feeling pressured and it's affecting her mental health.\n\nThe bride's side is about wanting a cohesive look, which is understandable, but the author is being firm about her own comfort and health. The key points here are the author's attempts to comply without growing her hair (clip-ins) and her valid health concerns. The bride's control over every detail might be unreasonable, especially if it's making the author anxious.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the info given, she's not refusing out of selfishness but due to practical and health reasons. The bride might need to compromise here. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's standing up for her own needs. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
