The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding not wanting to grow their hair for the friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to match in hairstyles, dresses, etc. The author has short, straight hair and suggests using clip-ins instead of growing their hair. The bride is being very controlling, and the author feels anxious and like a Debbie Downer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride is asking for a specific look, which is common for weddings to have a cohesive appearance. But the author's hair type is different and they've tried before without success. They also have allergies to jewelry and makeup, which the bride isn't accommodating well. The author offers alternatives (clip-ins, different earrings) but feels dismissed. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the bride has the right to have a certain vision for her wedding, but the author's comfort and health (allergies) are important. The author is trying to comply with the vision using alternatives but the bride isn't being flexible. The author's reasons are valid\u2014hair type that doesn't hold curls, past experiences, and allergies. They're not being unreasonable. The bride's behavior seems more controlling, making the author feel like they're the problem. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs and offering solutions, even if the bride isn't happy. The bride should be more accommodating, especially since the author is a bridesmaid and the wedding is about the couple. The answer is B.\n"
