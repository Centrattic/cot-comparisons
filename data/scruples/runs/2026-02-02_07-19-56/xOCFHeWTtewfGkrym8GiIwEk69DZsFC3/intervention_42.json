The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, and the author has straight, short hair that doesn't curl. She's offered to use clip-ins instead, but the bride is pushing for her to grow out her hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride is the one setting the requirements for the wedding, which is a common practice. The author is a bridesmaid, so her role is to support the bride's vision. However, the author has valid reasons: her hair type doesn't work with the desired look, and she has allergies to the jewelry and makeup. She's already made compromises, like suggesting alternatives to the jewelry.\n\nThe bride's approach seems controlling and might be causing stress for the author. The author feels her anxiety and body image issues are being triggered. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not complying. The bride is making demands that affect the bridesmaids, which could be seen as unreasonable, especially if they're causing distress. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both parties, like using clip-ins. \n\nAlso, the bride was described as rational before the engagement, which suggests this is part of wedding stress. The author's stance is about respecting her own comfort and physical limitations. While it's important to honor the bride's wishes, there's a line where it becomes excessive. The author isn't refusing all accommodations but is pushing back on something that's impractical for her. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The bride's demands are unreasonable in this case, and the author is trying to find a middle ground. So the answer would be B.\n"
