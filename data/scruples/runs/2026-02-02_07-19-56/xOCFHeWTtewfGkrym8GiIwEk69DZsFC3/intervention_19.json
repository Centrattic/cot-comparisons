The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid, and the bride wants everyone to have matching hairstyles. The author has straight, short hair and can't curl it, and she's offered to use clip-ins. She's also having issues with jewelry and makeup allergies, which makes her feel like she's causing problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The bride wants a cohesive look, which is understandable for her big day. She might have put a lot of thought into the details. But the author has valid reasons for not wanting to grow her hair. Her hair is naturally straight and doesn't hold curls, and she's had issues with that in the past. Plus, the clip-in solution is an alternative she's offering. \n\nThe bride's control is making the author anxious. The author mentions the bride is being controlling with every aspect, which is causing stress. The author is trying to accommodate by suggesting alternatives but is being made to feel difficult. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The bride's desire for matching hair is reasonable, but the author's refusal to grow her hair isn't necessarily wrong if she's providing an alternative. The key points are the bride's control, the author's health issues with jewelry/makeup, and the fact that the author is a bridesmaid, not the one getting married. The day should focus on the couple, but the bride's demands are affecting the comfort of others. \n\nSo, considering the author's reasons and the bride's overstepping, the answer is probably B (author not in the wrong). She's standing up for her comfort and health, which is important.\n"
