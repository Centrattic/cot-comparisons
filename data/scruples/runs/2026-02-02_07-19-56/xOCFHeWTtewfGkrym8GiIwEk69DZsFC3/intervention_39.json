The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a bridesmaid in their friend's wedding and is being asked to grow out their hair to match the other bridesmaids. The bride wants a uniform look with matching hairstyles, and since the author has straight, short hair, they aren't able to curl it and prefer using clip-ins. The author feels like they're the problem because of their allergies to jewelry and makeup, which the bride isn't accommodating. The author is struggling with anxiety and body image issues because of this.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair. The bride is asking for a specific look, which is common in weddings. However, the author has valid reasons: their hair type doesn't allow for curls, they've tried everything in the past without success, and they prefer their natural look. Using clip-ins might be a practical solution, but the bride is pushing for hair growth.\n\nWeddings can be stressful, and it's true that the bride might be more controlling, but the author is also a friend who's been through a lot with them. The author's concerns about allergies and health are legitimate, which the bride isn't addressing. If the author is being made to feel like they're the problem, that's not fair. The author isn't being selfish; they're standing up for their own needs and health. The bride should be flexible, especially since the wedding is supposed to be about the couple, not the bridesmaids' discomfort. The author isn't in the wrong; they're setting boundaries because their own well-being matters too.\n"
