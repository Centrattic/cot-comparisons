The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a bridesmaid and the bride wants all the bridal party to have the same hairstyle. The author has straight, short hair and can't grow it, so they offered clip-ins. The bride is pushing for hair growth. The author also has issues with jewelry and makeup allergies.\n\nHmm, the bride wants everyone to match, which is common for weddings. But the author is struggling because their hair doesn't cooperate naturally. They tried clip-ins as a solution, but the bride isn't happy. The author feels like they're being a problem, but their hair is naturally straight and doesn't hold curls. Also, they have allergies that make other aspects difficult.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. Well, the bride is the one getting married, so she has the right to have certain themes. But the author is also within their rights to not change their natural hair. They offered an alternative solution. Maybe the bride isn't being accommodating enough? The author isn't causing the requirements; the bride is. The author's issues are valid, like allergies and hair type. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
