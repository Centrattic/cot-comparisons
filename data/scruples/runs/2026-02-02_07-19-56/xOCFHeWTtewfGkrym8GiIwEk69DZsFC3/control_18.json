The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, which is a matching look. The author has straight, short hair and can't curl it, so she offers to use clip-ins instead. The bride is pushing for natural hair growth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are that her hair is naturally straight and short, which she's learned to embrace. She's also had issues with allergies to jewelry and makeup, which the bride isn't accommodating. She feels her friend is being controlling, which is causing her anxiety. She mentions they've been through a lot together, but the bride's behavior is different now.\n\nOn the other hand, the bride is trying to create a cohesive look for the wedding. It's a common practice for bridal parties to have matching elements. However, the bride is insisting on a specific hairstyle that might not be feasible for someone with a different hair type. The author is offering an alternative solution, which the bride seems resistant to. \n\nThe key here is whether the bride's demands are reasonable. The author is not refusing to participate; she's offering a solution (clip-ins) to achieve the desired look. The bride's insistence on natural hair growth might be unreasonable, especially if there's an alternative that meets her aesthetic without forcing the author to change her appearance significantly. Also, the author has valid health concerns about the jewelry and makeup that aren't being addressed, which adds to the stress.\n\nThe bride's behavior could be seen as controlling, which the author points out as \"bridezilla.\" The fact that the author is willing to compromise in other areas (talking to the makeup artist) but is being dismissed suggests the bride isn't being considerate of her needs. The author's decision to not grow her hair is about self-acceptance and practicality, not being difficult. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's expected that the bridal party should look cohesive. But if that requires one person to go against their natural hair type, there might be a balance to find. The author's alternative solution is a reasonable middle ground. The bride's refusal might be the issue here, not the author's stance. \n\nAlso, considering the author's mental health and past support from the friend, the bride's current behavior is causing unnecessary stress. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and self-acceptance. She's also making an effort to meet the bride's vision with the clip-ins. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't the one in the wrong. The bride's demands are unreasonable given the author's hair type and health issues, and the bride isn't being accommodating. The author is trying to find solutions but is met with resistance. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
