The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and the bride wants all the bridal party to have matching hair, but the author has straight, short hair that doesn't curl. She's offered to use clip-ins instead but the bride is pushing for her to grow her hair. The author is feeling anxious and like she's causing problems.\n\nFirst, the key points: The bride is insisting on a uniform look, which is understandable for a wedding. But the author has valid reasons\u2014her hair type makes it hard to style as required, and she's already offered an alternative (clip-ins). She also has allergies to the jewelry and makeup, which she's tried to address. The bride seems to be becoming overly controlling, which is causing stress for the author.\n\nThe author is standing her ground on her hair, which she's accepted and feels comfortable with. She's making compromises where possible (like discussing makeup, using clip-ins) but the hair is a non-negotiable for her. The bride's behavior is making her feel like the problem is on her side, but the bride is the one imposing strict requirements that aren't feasible for the author.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's trying to accommodate the bride's vision as much as possible without compromising her own comfort. The bride's demands might be unreasonable here. The author isn't being unhelpful; she's been through a lot with the friend and is still trying to comply. The issue is more about the bride's control than the author's refusal. So the answer should be B.\n"
