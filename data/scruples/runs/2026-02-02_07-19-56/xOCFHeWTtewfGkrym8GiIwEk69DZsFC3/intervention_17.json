The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for a friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and the bride wants everyone to match with the same hairstyle. The author has naturally straight hair that doesn't hold curls well, and she's offered to use clip-ins instead. She's also dealing with other issues like makeup allergies and costume jewelry, which makes her feel like she's the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The bride is setting strict guidelines for the bridal party, which is common in some weddings, but maybe over the top in this case. The author is trying to compromise by suggesting clip-ins. The key points are about control and the bride's expectations versus the author's comfort and health.\n\nThe bride is being very controlling, which the author mentions has caused anxiety and body shame. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to grow her hair\u2014her hair type doesn't work with the desired style, and she's learned to embrace her natural look. Plus, she's already making accommodations for the makeup and jewelry. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not complying with the hair request. The bride is the one setting the \"vision,\" but that doesn't mean the bridesmaids have to sacrifice their comfort or health. The author is standing up for her needs and offering alternatives. The bride's reaction seems dismissive of the author's concerns, which might indicate the bride is the one being unreasonable here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to balance the bride's wishes with her own well-being. The bride's excessive control is the main issue. The answer should be B.\n"
