The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, but the author has straight, short hair that doesn't hold curls. She's offered to use clip-ins instead. She also has issues with jewelry and makeup allergies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She's trying to have a cohesive look, which is common in weddings. But the author's hair type is different, and she's already made compromises, like suggesting she can't wear the original jewelry and trying to discuss makeup allergies. The author feels like she's being treated as difficult, which adds to her anxiety.\n\nThe key points here are consent and reasonable accommodations. The bride is asking for a specific look, but the author is trying to meet that requirement with an alternative solution. The bride's insistence on growing out hair could be seen as unreasonable if the author's hair naturally can't hold the style regardless of extensions. Also, the author's allergies are valid health concerns. \n\nThe bride's behavior, such as making the author feel like a Debbie Downer and being overly controlling, might be contributing to the tension. The author isn't refusing to participate but is seeking a solution that works for her. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she's making reasonable efforts to comply while advocating for her needs. The bride might need to be more flexible. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
