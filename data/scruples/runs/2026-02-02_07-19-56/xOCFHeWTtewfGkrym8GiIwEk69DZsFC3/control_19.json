The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, but the author has straight, short hair and can't curl it. She offers to use clip-ins, but the bride is pushing her to grow her hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride is enforcing a specific look, which is her right, but the author has valid reasons for not wanting to change her hair. The author mentions her allergies to jewelry and makeup, which she's already addressing by suggesting alternatives. She's feeling pressured and it's affecting her anxiety and body image. The bride is described as being very controlling now that she's engaged, which might be a red flag.\n\nThe author is trying to compromise by offering clip-ins, which should be a reasonable solution. The bride's insistence on hair growth seems unnecessary, especially since the author's hair is naturally straight and hard to style. Also, the author has a history of supporting the bride through tough times, which adds to the emotional weight here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not complying. The bride's demands are extensive (matching everything from dresses to hairstyles), and the author is already making accommodations. Insisting on hair growth when there's a viable alternative might be unreasonable. The bride's control might be crossing a line, especially if it's causing distress. The author's stance is about respecting her own hair and health concerns, which are legitimate. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
