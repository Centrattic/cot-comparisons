The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the wedding. The bride is requiring the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, and the author is the only one with short, straight hair. She's offered to use clip-ins but the bride seems resistant. The author is also dealing with other issues like allergies to jewelry and makeup, which the bride isn't accommodating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She's planning her wedding and wants a coordinated look for the bridal party. It's common for weddings to have some level of uniformity, so maybe the bride is just trying to achieve a cohesive aesthetic. However, the bride is insisting on hair growth, which is a significant change for the author. The author has valid reasons: her hair is straight and doesn't hold curls well, and she's happy with her short hair. Plus, she's already compromising on other things like earrings and makeup, and the bride isn't being flexible.\n\nThe author's main point is that she's being made to feel like she's causing problems when she's just trying to meet the bride's vision in another way. The bride's control over every detail is causing anxiety for the author. Since the author is in the bridal party, it's expected to cooperate to some extent, but the bride's demands are unreasonable if they're making the author uncomfortable. The author is trying to find a solution (clip-ins) that works for both, so maybe she's not in the wrong. The bride might be overstepping by not considering alternatives and making the author feel bad for asserting her boundaries. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
