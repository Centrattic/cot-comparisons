The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid who has naturally straight, short hair, and the bride is making several demands about matching hairstyles, jewelry, etc. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to grow her hair, like her hair not curling and skin allergies. She's also feeling anxious and like a Debbie Downer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She wants a cohesive look for the bridal party, which is common. But the author has specific issues that make some of these requests difficult. The author is offering alternatives, like clip-ins for hair and alternative jewelry, but the bride isn't accepting them. That seems problematic. The bride is being controlling, which the author mentions is different from how she was before getting engaged.\n\nThe key points are the author's health concerns (skin allergies) and the fact that her hair type makes the requested style impossible. She's also made to feel bad for not complying. The bride's demands are causing anxiety and body image issues. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bride is the one setting these expectations, and the author is trying to accommodate within her limits. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's pushing back against unreasonable demands. The fact that the bride is being controlling and not allowing flexibility might mean she's more at fault here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her needs and health. The bride's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
