The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid who has naturally straight, short hair, while the other bridesmaids have curly or black hair. The bride wants everyone to have the same hairstyle, and the author is resisting because her hair doesn't curl well and she prefers her natural look. She also has issues with the jewelry and makeup due to allergies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The bride wants the bridal party to look cohesive, which is common. But the author feels that her unique needs (allergies, hair type) are being ignored. The bride is coming off as controlling, which the author is struggling with. \n\nThe key points are: the author is trying to accommodate by suggesting clip-ins, which is a reasonable compromise. The bride's insistence on growing hair might not be considering the author's natural hair limitations. Also, the author has valid concerns about allergies, which the bride isn't addressing properly. \n\nThe author's main issue is feeling pressured to conform to a look that's not feasible for her, leading to anxiety. The bride's control over every detail is causing stress. The author isn't being unreasonable here; she's trying to find solutions but feels dismissed. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the bride should be flexible, especially since the author is making accommodations. The author isn't being difficult without reason. So, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
