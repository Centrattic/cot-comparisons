The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid, and the bride is enforcing a very strict, matching look for all the bridal party, including hairstyles. The author has naturally straight and short hair, which doesn't conform to the curly styles the others have. They suggested using clip-ins, but the bride isn't accepting that. The author also has allergies to jewelry and makeup, which the bride isn't accommodating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. It's her wedding, and she might have a vision for how the bridal party should look. However, the author is making compromises already, like offering to talk to the makeup artist. The bride's insistence on growing hair seems to ignore the author's natural hair type and past experiences. The author's refusal isn't about being difficult; it's about their comfort and personal expression. Also, the author mentions anxiety and body image issues, which are valid concerns. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the author being the only one with straight hair. The others have curly or black hair which might naturally hold styles better. The author's hair doesn't hold curls, making the clip-in solution a practical alternative. The bride's reaction makes the author feel like a Debbie Downer, which isn't fair. The author isn't the problem here; the bride is being overbearing. \n\nThe key points are: the author is trying to compromise, the bride is enforcing a strict vision without considering individual circumstances, and the author's refusal is based on personal comfort and past experiences. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when their health and well-being are involved. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
