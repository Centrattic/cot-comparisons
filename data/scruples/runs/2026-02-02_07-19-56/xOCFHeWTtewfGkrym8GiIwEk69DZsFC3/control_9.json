The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for her friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, but the author has straight, short hair and refuses to grow it, suggesting clip-ins instead. The author also mentions other issues like allergies to jewelry and makeup.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the hair. The bride wants uniformity, which is common in weddings for a cohesive look. But the author's hair type is different, and she's tried before without success. Growing hair takes time\u2014months, maybe\u2014and the wedding is in July. If the author's hair can't hold curls, maybe the bride's solution isn't feasible. The author is offering an alternative (clip-ins), which should work. The bride's insistence might be unreasonable here.\n\nThen there are the other points. Allergies to jewelry and makeup. The author suggested alternatives, but the bride isn't accepting them. That's another point where the bride is being controlling. The author is trying to be accommodating but is made to feel unhelpful. This adds to the author's stress. The bride's behavior is becoming overbearing, which is a common theme in \"bridezilla\" stories.\n\nThe author feels she's the \"Debbie downer,\" but she's actually trying to manage her own comfort and health. Her anxiety is valid, especially if the bride is being overbearing. Friendships can strain under such circumstances, but the author is standing up for her own needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the bride's demands are excessive and not considering the author's personal circumstances and health. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
