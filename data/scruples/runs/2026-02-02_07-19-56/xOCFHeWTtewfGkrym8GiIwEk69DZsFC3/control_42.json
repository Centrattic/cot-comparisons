The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for the friend's wedding. The situation is that the bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, but the author has straight, short hair and can't curl it. They offered to use clip-ins, but the bride is pushing for growing out hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to grow their hair. Their hair is naturally straight and doesn't hold curls well, which they've had issues with in the past. They've learned to accept their hair and even get some liberation from it being short. Also, the bride is being very controlling, adding other requirements like matching jewelry and makeup, which the author can't do due to allergies. The author is feeling anxious and thinks the bride is becoming overly controlling, even to the point of \"bridezilla.\"\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable. They tried to compromise by offering clip-ins. The bride's insistence on growing hair and matching everything else seems excessive, especially since the author has valid limitations. The fact that they've been close friends and the author is feeling body-shamed adds to the emotional weight here. The main issue is about personal autonomy and the bride's control over the event. Since the wedding should be about the couple, but the author is also within their rights to maintain their own comfort and self-acceptance. The author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their own needs and the bride is overstepping by being overly controlling. So the answer should be B.\n"
