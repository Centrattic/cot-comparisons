The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, same dresses, etc. The user has straight, short hair and can't curl it, so they suggested clip-ins instead. They also have allergies to the jewelry and makeup, but the bride isn't being flexible.\n\nHmm. The main issue is the bride's control over the bridal party's appearance. The user is a bridesmaid, so they have a role, but they're feeling pressured to change their natural look. The bride is being very strict about the matching, which might be reasonable up to a point, but the user is being made to feel like a problem for not wanting to grow their hair. The user has valid reasons: their hair type doesn't work, and they have allergies. They've offered compromises, but the bride isn't accepting those. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the bride is asking for a unified look, which is common for weddings, but the user is standing up for their own comfort and health. The bride's approach seems excessive, especially since the user is already making accommodations like clip-ins. The user's anxiety and body image issues are valid, and the bride's behavior is causing stress. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're trying to work within the bride's vision while respecting their own needs. So probably, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The bride is overstepping, and the user is justified in setting boundaries.\n"
