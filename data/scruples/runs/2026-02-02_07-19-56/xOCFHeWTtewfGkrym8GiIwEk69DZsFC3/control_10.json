The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for the friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid, and the bride wants all the bridal party to have the same hairstyle. The author has straight, short hair, which doesn't curl, and she's offered to use clip-ins instead. But the bride is pushing for her to grow her hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She's planning a wedding, which is a big deal, and she might want everything to look cohesive. It's her special day, so she might feel strongly about the details. However, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to grow her hair. Her hair doesn't hold curls, and she's allergic to some jewelry and makeup. She's tried to accommodate by offering alternatives, like clip-ins and discussing her allergies with the makeup artist, but the bride isn't accepting those solutions. \n\nThe author mentions that the bride is being controlling, which is making her anxious and causing body image issues. The bride was more rational before getting engaged, so this might be part of wedding stress. The author is trying to stay positive but feels like she's the problem. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent, health issues, and reasonable accommodations. The author isn't refusing to participate; she's offering alternatives. The bride's control is affecting the author's mental health. The author isn't in the wrong if she's making her health and comfort a priority. Also, the bride's demands go beyond just the hair\u2014she's also forcing specific jewelry and makeup, which the author can't use due to allergies. That adds to the argument that the bride is overstepping.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to work with the bride's vision but has legitimate constraints. The bride should consider that not everyone can or wants to conform to the same look, especially when it's impractical or harmful. The author isn't an asshole for asserting her needs and boundaries. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
