The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a bridesmaid not wanting to grow her hair for the wedding because her hair is naturally straight and short, and the bride wants everyone to match.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She wants a cohesive look for the bridal party, which is common. But the bridesmaid has valid reasons: her hair doesn't hold curls, she has allergies, and she's been through a lot with her friend. She's offered alternatives like clip-ins and discussed the jewelry and makeup issues. \n\nThe bride's demands seem excessive. Matching hair can be a lot, especially when it's not practical for someone's hair type. The bridesmaid is already making accommodations, like using clip-ins. The bride's control over every detail might be causing stress, which the author is feeling. Also, the bride's behavior is changing post-engagement, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and reasonable accommodations. The author isn't refusing to help; she's proposing solutions. The bride's insistence on growing hair is a personal choice the author isn't comfortable with. Since the wedding should be about the couple, not the bridesmaids' personal sacrifices, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own comfort and boundaries, which is important for her mental health. The answer should be B.\n"
