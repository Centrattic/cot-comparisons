The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for the friend's wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a bridesmaid whose friend, the bride, wants all the bridal party to have the same hairstyle. The author has naturally straight, short hair and the others have curly or black hair. The bride is suggesting the author grow their hair, but the author prefers using clip-in hair extensions instead. They've also mentioned issues with jewelry allergies and makeup allergies, which aren't being addressed well by the bride. The author feels the bride is being overly controlling now that she's engaged, which is causing anxiety.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the bride wants uniformity for the wedding, which is common in some weddings. As a friend, the author might be expected to comply with the bride's vision. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons: their hair doesn't hold curls, they've accepted their natural hair, and they have allergies. They offered alternatives like clip-ins and discussing makeup, but the bride isn't accommodating. The author is also feeling that the bride is being controlling, which might be a sign of bridezilla behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons. They're not just being difficult; they have practical issues (allergies, hair type) and have offered alternatives. The bride's insistence on growing hair might be unreasonable given these factors. The author's anxiety and the bride's increased control could also be affecting the dynamic. It's about respecting the author's autonomy versus the bride's vision. Since the author is trying to cooperate but has legitimate concerns, it's more likely they're not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
