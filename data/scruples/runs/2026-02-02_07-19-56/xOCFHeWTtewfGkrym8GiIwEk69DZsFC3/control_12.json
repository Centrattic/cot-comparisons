The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and has short, straight hair, while the other bridesmaids have curly or black hair. The bride wants everyone to have the same hairstyle, suggesting the author grow their hair. The author proposes using clip-in hair extensions instead. There are also issues with jewelry allergies and makeup, making the author feel like they're being difficult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The bride has a vision for the bridal party's appearance, which is common in weddings. However, the author has a valid reason for not wanting to grow their hair\u2014their hair is straight and doesn't hold curls well, and they've accepted it. They're also addressing allergies, which is a health concern. The bride's control over every detail is causing anxiety for the author, which is understandable.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. The bride is asking for a specific look, but the author is offering an alternative solution (clip-ins) that can achieve the same result without changing their hair. The bride's reaction to the author's concerns (like allergies) seems dismissive, which is problematic. The author isn't being difficult just for the sake of it; they have legitimate issues that the bride isn't addressing.\n\nAlso, the author feels they're being seen as negative or unhelpful, which adds to their anxiety. The situation isn't just about hair; it's about the bride's control and how it's affecting the author's well-being. The author is trying to compromise by suggesting alternatives but is met with resistance. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author isn't refusing to participate entirely but is standing by their personal choice and health concerns. The bride's demands might be excessive, and the author's response is reasonable. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
