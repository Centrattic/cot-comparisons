The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a bridesmaid in her friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridal party to have matching hairstyles, which includes growing out hair. The author has naturally straight, short hair that doesn't hold curls well, and she's offered to use clip-ins to meet the bride's vision. But the bride is pushing for her to grow her hair. The author is also dealing with other issues like jewelry allergies and makeup concerns, which she's tried to address but feels she's being made to feel difficult. The author is anxious and feels like she's the problem here, but she loves her short hair and finds it liberating.\n\nSo, the key points are: the bride wants uniformity, the author is trying to comply but has valid reasons (hair type, allergies) that make the bride's demands difficult. The author is flexible (offers clip-ins, suggests alternatives), but the bride is being controlling. The author is feeling shamed and anxious about it.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to maintain her natural hair and using alternatives to meet the bride's wishes doesn't seem unreasonable. The bride is asking for a specific look, but the author is making compromises. The bride might value the uniformity, but it's not like the author is refusing to participate. The author's health and comfort (allergies) are also valid concerns. The bride's behavior seems more controlling, which is on her, not the author. The author isn't being difficult; she's trying to work around her limitations. So, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
