The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The situation is about a friend's wedding where the bride wants all the bridesmaids to have a matching hairstyle. The author is a bridesmaid with straight, short hair, and she's the only one with that hair type. The bride is suggesting she grow her hair, but the author offers to use clip-ins instead. The author has tried before to make her hair curly but it doesn't work, and she's learned to accept her natural hair. There's also the issue of allergies to jewelry and makeup, which the bride isn't accommodating.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the hairstyle. The bride wants everyone to match, but the author's hair is different. The author is suggesting a solution that might work (clip-ins), but the bride is pushing for her to grow her hair. The author feels like she's the problem here, being the \"Debbie downer.\" \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bride is trying to create a cohesive look, which is understandable. But the author's hair type is naturally straight and short, and she's already tried methods to make it curly without success. The fact that she's offering an alternative solution (clip-ins) shows she's trying to comply with the bride's vision. The bride's insistence on growing hair might not be considering the author's natural hair and the impracticality of it. \n\nThen there's the part about the jewelry and makeup allergies. The author is concerned about health issues, but the bride isn't accommodating. The author is trying to find compromises (like studs), but the bride is not accepting them. This adds to the author's stress and feeling of being unappreciated. \n\nThe author is also experiencing anxiety and body image issues because of the bride's control. The friend's personality has changed post-engagement, which is affecting the author's mental health. The author is standing up for her own needs and health, which is important. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author is trying to comply with the bride's wishes but has valid reasons (natural hair type, allergies) that the bride isn't considering. The author is offering solutions, but the bride is being inflexible. The author's stance is about respecting her own hair and health, which seems reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The bride's demands are excessive, and the author is asserting her boundaries, which is the right thing to do. The answer should be B (No).\n"
