The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The bride wants all the bridal party to have the same hairstyle, but the author has naturally straight, short hair and can't curl it. They tried clip-ins, but the bride is pushing for growing hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The bride is in charge of the wedding, and as a bridesmaid, the author is expected to comply with certain requests. However, the author has valid reasons: their hair just doesn't work with the desired style, and they have allergies to jewelry and makeup. They offered alternatives, like clip-ins and discussing makeup with the artist, but the bride is not being accommodating.\n\nThe author is feeling like they're the \"Debbie downer,\" which suggests they might feel their concerns are being dismissed. The bride's control over every detail is causing anxiety and body image issues for the author. The key here is whether it's reasonable to expect the author to change their hair just to fit the bride's vision, especially when they've already offered alternatives.\n\nIn many cases, weddings do require some coordination in appearance, like dresses and shoes, but there's usually some flexibility. Hair is a personal choice. The bride might have a vision, but it's important to balance that with the comfort and well-being of the bridal party. The author isn't refusing to participate; they're trying to find a solution that works. The bride's insistence on growing hair when there are alternatives available might be unreasonable.\n\nAlso, the author's past experiences of struggling with their hair type and the fact that it's a source of liberation for them adds weight to their stance. They're not being inconsiderate; they're advocating for their own needs while still wanting to support the bride. The bride's reaction to the author's allergies and suggestions seems dismissive, which could indicate a lack of empathy on her part.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their personal preferences and health concerns, and they've already tried to accommodate the bride's vision. The bride's rigid approach might be the issue here, not the author. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
