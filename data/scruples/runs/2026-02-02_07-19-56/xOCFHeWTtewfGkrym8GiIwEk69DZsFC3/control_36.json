The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a bridesmaid for a friend's wedding in July. The bride wants all the bridesmaids to have matching hairstyles, dresses, shoes, etc. The problem is that the author has short, naturally straight hair, while the others have curly or black hair. The bride is suggesting the author grow her hair, but the author offers to use clip-in extensions instead. The author mentions that her straight hair doesn't hold curls and she's learned to embrace it. She also has issues with the jewelry and makeup due to allergies, which she's tried to address but feels dismissed. The author is anxious and feeling body-shamed because the bride is being very controlling, unlike her pre-engagement self. She questions if she's an asshole for not wanting to grow her hair.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the bride's demands versus the author's personal comfort and health. The bride wants uniformity among the bridesmaids, which is common in weddings. However, the author has valid reasons for not complying: her hair type doesn't allow the style, using clip-ins is a reasonable alternative, and she has allergies that make other adjustments difficult. \n\nThe author is offering solutions (clip-ins, different jewelry) but the bride isn't accepting them. This makes me think the bride is the one being inflexible. The author isn't refusing to comply entirely; she's proposing alternatives. The bride's insistence on growing hair might be unreasonable, especially if it's causing anxiety and the author has a valid solution. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the bride's behavior is leading to body shame and anxiety, which is a red flag. The bride's control over every aspect might be excessive. The author's main request is to keep her short hair, which is part of her identity and self-acceptance. Forcing someone to change their appearance for a wedding could be considered disrespectful, especially if it's causing stress. \n\nThe key points here are: the author is offering alternatives, the bride is the one being controlling, and the author's reasons are valid (hair type, allergies). The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's trying to accommodate while respecting her own needs. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
