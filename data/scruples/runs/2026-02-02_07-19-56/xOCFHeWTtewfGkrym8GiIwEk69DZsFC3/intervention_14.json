The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The situation is that the bride wants all the bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle, but the author has straight, short hair that doesn't curl and can't use the jewelry or makeup because of allergies. They offered alternatives but feel their friend is being too controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The bride is organizing a wedding and wants a certain look for the bridal party. That's her right, but there might be limits. The author has valid reasons: their hair type is a natural trait, not something they can easily change without health issues. The fact that they can't use jewelry due to allergies is another health concern. They tried to compromise by suggesting clip-ins, which seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the anxiety and body image issues. The author mentions that the bride's control is causing them stress. The bride was more reasonable before getting engaged, so maybe the wedding planning is bringing out a more controlling side. The author is trying to assert their own needs, which is important for self-respect.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable by not growing their hair? Growing hair takes time and might not even work if the style requires curls. The author's hair is naturally straight and doesn't hold curls well, so using clip-ins is a practical solution. The bride's insistence on growing hair might be impractical for the author's hair type and personal comfort.\n\nAlso, the author is trying to accommodate the bride's vision as much as possible by offering alternatives. The issue is that the bride isn't accepting these solutions and instead is making the author feel like a problem. That's on the bride, perhaps, but the question is about the author's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author has supported the friend through tough times. Now, the author is trying to protect their own well-being. The wedding should be about the couple, but the bridesmaids should also feel respected in their personal choices. It's a balance between the bride's vision and the comfort of the bridal party.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and are trying to find middle ground. The bride might need to be more flexible, but the author isn't being unreasonable by not growing their hair. The answer should be B.\n"
