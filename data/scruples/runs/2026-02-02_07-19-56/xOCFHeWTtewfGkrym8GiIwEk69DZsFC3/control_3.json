The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow their hair for a friend's wedding. The key points here are the bride's demands for uniformity among the bridesmaids and the author's personal reasons for resisting.\n\nFirst, the bride is insisting on matching hairstyles, which the author is resistant to because their hair is naturally straight and short, unlike the others. The author suggests using clip-in hair extensions instead of growing their hair. They also mention previous issues with jewelry allergies and makeup, which they tried to address but felt their concerns weren't taken seriously. This has led to anxiety and body image issues for the author.\n\nI need to consider the balance between the bride's vision and the bridesmaid's individuality and comfort. The bride has a right to have a cohesive look for her wedding, but it shouldn't come at the cost of making a friend feel uncomfortable or unappreciated. The author has already offered a compromise (clip-ins) to meet the bride's needs without altering their natural hair. The bride's reaction to the author's concerns about allergies and hair type seems dismissive, which isn't healthy for a friendship built on mutual support.\n\nThe author's reasons are valid: their hair type doesn't respond well to curling, and they've accepted their natural hair. The bride's control over every aspect might be causing stress for the author, which is a red flag. Weddings can become overwhelming for people, but friends should prioritize each other's well-being. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're standing up for their comfort and health. So, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
