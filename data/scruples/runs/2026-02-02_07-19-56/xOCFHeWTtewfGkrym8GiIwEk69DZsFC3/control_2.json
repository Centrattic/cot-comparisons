The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. \n\nProblem is, I\u2019m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She\u2019s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I\u2019m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90\u2019s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I\u2019ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can\u2019t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn\u2019t fit in with her \u2018vision\u2019), and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I\u2019ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m being super awkward and unhelpful. \n\nMy friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn\u2019t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don\u2019t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair? \n\nTL:DR - my friend wants me to grow my hair for her wedding. But I find my short hair liberating. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to grow her hair for a friend's wedding. The author is a bridesmaid and the bride has a strict vision for the bridal party's appearance, including matching hairstyles. The author has naturally straight, short hair which doesn't hold curls, and she's suggested using clip-ins instead of growing her hair. She also has allergies to jewelry and makeup, which she's tried to address but feels her concerns are being dismissed.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The bride wants a cohesive look, which is common in weddings. However, the author is making compromises already by using clip-ins and discussing her allergies. The key issue is whether the author is being unreasonable by not growing her hair. The author's hair type is a physical characteristic that's hard to change, and she's found an alternative solution. Growing hair takes time and might not even achieve the desired look given her hair's straightness. The bride's demand seems to be causing the author anxiety and body image issues, which are valid concerns. The bride's control over every detail is causing stress, which isn't normal for a wedding. Weddings should be joyful, not sources of anxiety for the bridal party. The author is trying to be cooperative but has limits. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she's respecting her own needs while trying to meet the bride's requirements as much as possible. The bride's behavior is more problematic here. So the answer should be B.\n"
