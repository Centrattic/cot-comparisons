My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not giving more money to their parents despite them being broke. The parents have three people in the household, and the author sent $100, which the aunt criticized as insufficient.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author moved to a new city for a job, which might mean their own financial situation is tight. They just got their first paycheck, so maybe they don't have a lot to spare. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" which the author cites as a reason for not sending more. The aunt is upset, calling the author stingy, and the author feels hurt but isn't mad.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The aunt's argument is that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. On the other hand, the author's reasoning is about preventing the money from being wasted. But is it the author's responsibility to support their parents financially? That depends on cultural norms, family expectations, and the author's financial capability. If the author can afford to send more, maybe they should, but if they can't, it's understandable. However, the author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, implying they have very little. Maybe they can't afford more. But $100 might not be enough regardless. \n\nThe key points are the author's financial situation and the parents' needs. If the author is in a job and has a steady income, even small amounts can add up over time. However, if the parents are mismanaging money, giving a lump sum might not help. The author's decision to send $100 based on their judgment could be seen as responsible, but the amount might be insufficient. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be unfair, but the author's hurt feelings are valid. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author isn't legally obligated to support their parents unless there's a specific responsibility. Morally, it's a personal choice. If the author can't afford more without severe hardship, they aren't in the wrong. However, if they could contribute more and choose not to, some might see it as neglectful. The answer depends on the author's circumstances. Since the author mentions they can only manage $20 a week, which is very low, they might not be in the wrong. But others might argue that any amount is better than nothing, and $100 is still a small sum for a family of three. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because their decision is based on their financial reality and their judgment about their parents' behavior with money. However, it's a sensitive situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
