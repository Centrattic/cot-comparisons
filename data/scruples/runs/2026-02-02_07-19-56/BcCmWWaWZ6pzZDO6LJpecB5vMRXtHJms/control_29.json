I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100. The aunt criticized the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The author explains they didn't send more because they know their parents waste money, but they're hurt by the aunt's comments.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break down the key points. The author has a new job and is in a different city. They sent $100, which they thought would last a few days. The parents are poor and have financial issues. The aunt is being passive-aggressive, accusing the author of being stingy. The author isn't mad but is hurt.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that if they send more, it might be wasted. They might be trying to be responsible with their own income. On the other hand, $100 might not be sufficient for a family's needs. However, the author is in a new job, so maybe they have limited income themselves. Their decision is based on past experiences with their parents' financial behavior.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to support parents unless in certain situations, but emotionally, it's a family issue. The author isn't being malicious, just trying to balance their own financial responsibility. The aunt's criticism is part of the problem here, but the author's choice is based on their judgment. The answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because they made a reasoned decision considering their parents' habits and their own circumstances. So, the answer is B.\n"
