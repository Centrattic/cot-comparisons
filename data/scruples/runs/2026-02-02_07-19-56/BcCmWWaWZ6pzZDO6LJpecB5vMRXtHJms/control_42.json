I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their parents through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt then got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the parents to waste the money, and they mentioned they could survive on $20 a week themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" which is why the author is hesitant to send more. The author might be trying to prevent the money from being mismanaged. On the other hand, the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough for a family's needs. The author's response was not sending more and not engaging further with the aunt's messages.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are the parents' financial situation, the author's own circumstances (new job, moving to a new city), and the communication issues with the aunt. The author's decision is based on preventing waste, not out of stinginess. However, the amount might not be sufficient for the family's immediate needs, even if the parents are bad with money. \n\nFrom one perspective, the author is being cautious to avoid enabling poor financial habits. But from another angle, the parents are in a crisis (father's hospitalization), and the author's contribution, while well-intentioned, might not meet their basic needs. The aunt's concern is valid about the amount being too low. However, the author isn't obligated to provide more if they feel it's not the right approach. The hurt feelings on both sides complicate things. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is responsible for their parents' financial management. If the parents are adults, the author isn't necessarily at fault for not wanting to give money that could be misused. But if the parents are in a dire situation and the author can afford to help more, there might be some ethical obligation. However, the author's own financial stability and their reasoning about preventing waste are important factors. Since the author isn't forcing the parents to take the money and is choosing based on their own judgment, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
