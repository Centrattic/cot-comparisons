      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sending their parents more money. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The parents are described as \"basically broke,\" and the dad had a psychotic break recently. The aunt reacted negatively, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and called the author stingy. The author explains they didn't send more because they know their parents are bad with money. They mention that they can survive on $20 a week, implying they have a low income themselves. Now, they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nFactors to consider: The parents' financial situation is dire, they have a sick family member, and a younger brother. The author's reasoning is that sending more would be wasted. But maybe the author is being stingy. However, the author might have their own financial constraints, making it hard to send more. Also, the parents' poor money management could be a valid concern. But the aunt's reaction suggests that even $100 isn't sufficient for their needs. The author's justification is about preventing waste, but maybe they should have at least tried to send a bit more given the circumstances. Alternatively, maybe the author is within their rights to protect their own resources, especially if they have limited income. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author has the means to help more, maybe they should. However, if they can't afford to send more, it's understandable. The author says they can survive on $20 a week, which seems very low. Maybe they can afford to send more. But $100 might be their maximum capacity. Alternatively, maybe they could have communicated better, explaining their financial situation. \n\nThe aunt's passive-aggressive comments might not be fair, but the parents' needs are real. The author's decision to not send more could be seen as selfish, but if they have their own financial struggles, it's a gray area. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author had the means. If they can afford to send more, then maybe they're in the wrong. If they can't, then not. The author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, which might mean they're not in a position to send more. However, even $100 might be considered insufficient by the parents. The author's reasoning about the parents wasting money is a valid point, but the parents' needs are urgent. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they made a conscious decision based on their understanding of their parents' behavior and their own financial limits. However, there's a chance they could have found a middle ground. But based on the information given, it's a tough call. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they did send some money and have valid reasons, even if others disagree.\n"
