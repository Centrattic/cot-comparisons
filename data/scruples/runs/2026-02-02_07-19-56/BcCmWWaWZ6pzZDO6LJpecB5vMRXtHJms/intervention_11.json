I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. So I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The aunt was upset and said $100 was too little, and the author didn't send more because they think their parents waste money. The aunt called them stingy, and now the author is feeling hurt and wants to know if they did the wrong thing.\n\nSo the main points here are: the parents are broke, the author is concerned about their parents spending the money wisely, and the amount sent was $100. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the parents to waste the money, so they limited the amount. The aunt is upset about the amount and the author's perceived stinginess.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is in a new job, so maybe they're just starting out and have limited funds. They moved for the job, so maybe they have their own expenses now. The parents are in a difficult financial situation, so the author might feel pressure to help. However, the author is trying to protect the money from being wasted, which is a valid concern if the parents have a history of poor financial management.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt's reaction suggests that $100 is insufficient for a family of three. The author might not be aware of the actual financial needs of the family. The author's justification is about preventing waste, but the family's basic needs (like food) might be a priority. If the parents are truly broke, even $100 might not be enough, and the author's intention to help but ensure the money is used wisely could be seen as conflicting.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the parents are in dire need, sending $100 might be seen as insufficient. However, the author's concern about misuse is understandable. The aunt is acting as a mediator, which might not be the best approach. The author's decision to not send more could be seen as selfish if the parents are in a crisis, but if they're trying to be responsible, it could be justified.\n\nI need to consider cultural factors too. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, and not providing enough could be seen as neglect. In others, independence is encouraged, and the author is within their rights to manage their own finances. The author's mention of being able to survive on $20 a week suggests they are living frugally, but that doesn't necessarily mean they can afford to send more. However, $100 is a significant amount for a new job's first paycheck, but if the parents need more for basic needs, it's a problem.\n\nThe author's reasoning is logical, but empathy might tip the scales. If the parents are truly struggling, the amount sent might not be enough regardless of the author's intentions. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments could be part of the issue, but the core is the author's choice. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They have valid reasons, but maybe not considering the actual needs of the family could be a mistake. Alternatively, if the parents are not using the money properly, the author is trying to do the right thing. \n\nI think the key is whether the author is being unreasonably stingy or making a practical decision. The author might not be in the wrong if the parents are not managing money well, but if the parents are in immediate need, the amount is insufficient. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they are making a judgment based on their knowledge of the parents' habits. However, if the parents' need is more urgent, then maybe A (in the wrong). But the author's reasoning is to prevent waste, which is a valid concern. So leaning towards B.\n"
