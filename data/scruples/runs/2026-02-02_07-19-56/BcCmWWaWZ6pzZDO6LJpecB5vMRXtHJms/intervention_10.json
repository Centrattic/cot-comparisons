I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the author moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break, and they sent $100 to their parents through an aunt. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author explains that they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt is passive-aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" which might be why the author is hesitant to send more. The author is in a new job and maybe just started, so their financial situation might be tight too. Sending $100 could be a significant portion of their income. The aunt's reaction is aggressive, but the author isn't responding to her messages. The author feels hurt but isn't angry.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author made a mistake. On one hand, the parents are in need, and $100 might not be enough. On the other hand, the author is trying to manage their own finances responsibly, considering their parents' tendency to waste money. There's a cultural aspect too\u2014some cultures expect children to support their parents more. However, the author might have valid reasons for not sending more. The key points are the parents' financial habits, the author's financial situation, and the aunt's role in the conflict.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a moral dilemma. The author might be in the right if they can't afford more or if they trust their judgment about their parents' spending. Alternatively, they might be wrong if their parents genuinely need more support and the author is capable of giving more. The answer isn't black and white, but since the author chose to send $100 based on their own reasoning, they might not be in the wrong. However, not engaging with the aunt's concerns could be a point against them. But the main question is about the amount sent, not the communication. The author's decision is their own, considering their circumstances. So the answer might be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
