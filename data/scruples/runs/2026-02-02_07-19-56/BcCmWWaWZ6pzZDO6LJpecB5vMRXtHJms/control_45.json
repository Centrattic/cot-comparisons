I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the author just moved for a job and got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and called the author stingy. The author didn't respond and didn't send more. They're hurt but think $100 could last a few days.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider factors. The parents are in a tough situation financially, and the author is in a new job, maybe just starting to earn. The author's reasoning is that the parents might waste more money. But the aunt argues $100 isn't enough. The author's stance is that they can live on $20 a week, implying they have limited funds.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help but is cautious due to the parents' financial habits. On the other hand, the parents might genuinely need more. But the author is still new in their job, so their financial stability might be uncertain. The key here is whether the author is obligated to give more. If the author feels that giving more would lead to waste and isn't in a position to give more, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the parents are in dire need, maybe the author should give more despite the risk. But the author's reasoning is valid; they don't want the money mismanaged. The aunt's reaction seems to be from a place of concern, but the author's decision is based on their own judgment. So, is the author wrong? Probably not, since they made a considered decision based on their circumstances. So the answer would be B.\n"
