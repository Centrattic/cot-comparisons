I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the person sent $100 but the aunt was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author just started a job and got their first paycheck. They sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt criticized the amount, saying it's not enough for three people. The author explained they didn't want the money wasted because the parents are bad with money. They didn't send more and now the aunt is passive-aggressive.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasoning. They chose not to send more to prevent the money from being wasted. The parents have a history of poor financial management. The author is also concerned about their own financial situation, as they mention that they can survive on $20 a week, implying they might have limited resources themselves.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the question is whether the author is obligated to give more despite knowing the parents might misuse it. The author's decision is based on practicality, trying to help without enabling poor financial habits. However, the aunt's reaction suggests there's a cultural or familial expectation of providing more support. But the author isn't the one who's broke\u2014they have the money and chose not to give more, not because they can't afford it, but because they think it's not wise.\n\nI should also consider if the author is in the wrong. If they have the means and the parents are in dire need, some might argue they should give more. But others might say that the author is within their right to set boundaries, especially if they know the money will be misused. The author isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014they did send $100, which is a gesture, but chose not to send more.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is valid. Since they made a conscious choice based on the parents' financial habits, and they are not in a position of obligation unless there's a legal or traditional duty, the author likely isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
