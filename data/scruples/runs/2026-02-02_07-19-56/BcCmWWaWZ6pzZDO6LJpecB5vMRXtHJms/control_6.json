I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, the author sent $100 but the aunt was upset, saying it's not enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author moved to a new city for a job, which probably means they're starting out and maybe have limited income. They sent $100 because they couldn't contact their mom. The aunt was passive-aggressive, calling the author stingy. The author explains they don't want the money wasted because the parents are bad with money.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is about preventing waste, not about being mean. They also mention they can survive on $20 a week, which might indicate they're not in a position to give more. The aunt is trying to mediate, but the issue is between the author and their parents.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they made a choice based on their judgment of the parents' financial habits. The parents are adults, and the author isn't obligated to support them unless there's a legal or cultural expectation. Also, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if the parents misuse funds. However, the aunt's perspective is that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. But the author's stance is about preventing waste, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn many cases, people might argue that it's up to the parents to manage their money, and the author isn't responsible. However, if the parents are in a crisis (dad hospitalized), maybe the author could consider other forms of support besides money. But the author's reasoning is about avoiding waste, which is a personal decision. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to send a smaller amount based on that reasoning. The problem is the aunt's reaction, not the author's decision. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
