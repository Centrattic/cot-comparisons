I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100 via an aunt. The aunt was upset, saying it's not enough for a family of three, and the author didn't send more. The author feels hurt and doesn't think they're in the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are in a bad financial situation. The author moved for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100, which the aunt considered too little and passive-aggressive. The author's reasoning is to avoid the parents wasting the money. The aunt implied the money isn't enough for their needs.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're not in the wrong because they think the $100 is sufficient for a few days. But the question is whether they should have sent more. Factors to consider: the parents' financial state, the author's responsibility towards them, cultural expectations, and personal circumstances.\n\nThe author mentions their parents are \"terrible with money,\" which is a key point. If the parents are likely to spend the money on non-essentials, the author might have a valid reason to limit the amount. However, if the parents genuinely need the money for basic needs like food and housing, sending $100 might be insufficient. \n\nAnother angle is the author's own financial situation. They say they can survive on $20 a week, which suggests they might be in a low-income job or starting out. If they're also managing their own expenses in a new city, their ability to send more might be limited. However, if they have the means to send more but choose not to, that could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over their family's needs.\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, regardless of the parents' financial habits. In others, individuals are encouraged to manage their own finances and not be taken advantage of. The aunt's reaction might reflect cultural expectations that the author should provide more support.\n\nThe author's decision not to send more could be seen as self-preservation if they believe the money will be mismanaged. However, the parents' well-being is also a factor. If the author has the capacity to help more but refuses, that might make them at fault. Conversely, if they genuinely can't afford more, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments and the author feeling hurt suggest there's underlying tension. The author's refusal to send more could be a way to set boundaries, but it might also be perceived as neglect.\n\nIn summary, whether the author is in the wrong depends on their financial capability, the parents' actual needs, and cultural expectations. If the author can afford to send more and the parents genuinely need it for survival, they might be in the wrong for not helping. But if they can't afford more or the parents are likely to misuse the funds, they might be justified in their decision.\n"
