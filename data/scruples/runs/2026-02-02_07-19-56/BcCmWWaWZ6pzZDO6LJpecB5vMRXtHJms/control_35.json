I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100 but an aunt was upset. The author explains they don't want the money wasted.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that the parents are bad with money, so they limit the amount sent. The aunt is passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author is hurt but stands by their decision. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they are helping by sending $100, which is more than nothing. The parents might need more, but the author has their own judgment about how to support them. The key point is whether the amount given is reasonable. The author's logic is to prevent waste, which is a valid consideration. The aunt's reaction is maybe overreacting. \n\nAlso, the author is in a new city, busy with a job. They might have financial constraints too. Sending $100 without being able to monitor usage could be a risk. The author isn't refusing to help entirely; they're just managing the amount. \n\nSo, the author's actions are understandable. They're trying to balance helping while considering the parents' habits. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They\u2019re making a judgment call based on their knowledge of their parents' behavior.\n"
