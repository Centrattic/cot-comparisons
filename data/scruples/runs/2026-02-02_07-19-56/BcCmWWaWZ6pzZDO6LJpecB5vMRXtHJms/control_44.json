      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. Their dad had a psychotic break, and they sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author explains they didn't send more to avoid the parents wasting the money. The aunt kept messaging, and the author feels hurt but isn't mad. They're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasoning for sending $100 instead of more. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" so the author is trying to protect the money from being misused. The aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author isn't mad but feels hurt. \n\nNow, considering cultural and familial expectations: In many cultures, especially in some Asian or collectivist societies, supporting parents financially is expected. However, the situation here is complicated by the parents' financial habits. If the parents are known to waste money, the author's decision might be seen as responsible. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the parents' current situation\u2014father hospitalized, so they might be in a crisis. The aunt's argument that $100 isn't enough for a family of three could be valid, but the author might not have the resources or the trust to send more. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on preventing misuse, which is a logical approach, but it might clash with the aunt's and possibly the family's expectations. The author isn't refusing to help entirely, just limiting the amount. The hurt feelings come from the aunt's passive-aggressive comments, but the author's stance is consistent with their reasoning.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't wrong for protecting their resources and making a judgment call about their parents' spending. However, they might be expected to find a middle ground, like discussing how the money is used or setting up a system to ensure it's spent responsibly. But given the information, the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong. They're balancing their own financial responsibility with helping their family, even if the help is limited. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
