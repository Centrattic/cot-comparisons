My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. Their dad had a psychotic break, so their parents are in a tough spot financially. The user sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and called the user stingy. The user explains they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt is passive-aggressive. The user isn't mad but feels hurt and doesn't send more. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the context. The parents are struggling financially, and the user is now employed but in a new city. The user might be in a new job, so their income could be a factor. They sent $100, but the aunt argues it's not enough. The user's reasoning is to prevent waste, but maybe the parents genuinely need more. However, the user might have their own financial constraints. They mention they can survive on $20 a week, implying they're also not in a wealthy position. The parents' financial habits are described as terrible, so the user's caution makes sense. But is $100 really enough? If the family has three people, even in a cheaper area, $100 might not last long. \n\nBut the user's responsibility here isn't entirely clear. They might not be obligated to support their parents financially unless there's a legal obligation. However, culturally, family support can be expected. The user's decision to not send more is based on preventing misuse, which is a valid concern. But maybe the user should have communicated better or found another way to help without enabling poor financial habits. Alternatively, $100 could be symbolic, but the aunt's reaction suggests it's not sufficient. The user's hurt feelings and the aunt's passive-aggressiveness complicate things. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they made a conscious decision based on the parents' history with money, and they did send some help. The aunt's reaction might be exacerbating the situation. But maybe the user could have considered the actual needs more, even if the parents misuse funds. It's a tough balance between helping and enabling. Since the user explained their reasoning and chose not to send more, they aren't necessarily wrong. Answer B.\n"
