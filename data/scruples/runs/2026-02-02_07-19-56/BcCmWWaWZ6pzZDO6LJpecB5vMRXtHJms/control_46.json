I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about whether sending $100 to their parents is enough, given the parents' financial situation and the author's new job.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, the author sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact the mother. The aunt was upset about the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The author explains that they don't want the parents to waste the money. The aunt was passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author didn't respond to the aunt's messages and isn't mad but feels hurt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nConsidering the factors: The author is working a new job and might be establishing their own financial stability. The parents are in a bad situation, but the author has concerns about money being wasted. The aunt's reaction is emotional, but the author's reasoning is about preventing waste. The amount sent might be seen as insufficient by the aunt's standard, but the author's perspective is based on past experiences with parents mismanaging money.\n\nIn AITA contexts, it's common for people to feel conflicted. The author isn't ignoring the parents' needs but is being cautious. There's no indication that the author is withholding money out of spite or neglecting to help entirely. They did send money, just a smaller amount. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might not justify the author being in the wrong unless there's a duty to provide more. However, the author isn't the parent's sole support; they have a younger brother, so maybe others are helping.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is valid\u2014preventing waste. The parents' poor money management is a known issue. The author's decision to send a smaller amount could be seen as responsible to ensure the money is used appropriately. The aunt's reaction being passive-aggressive and the author not engaging might be their right, especially if the aunt is overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in times of crisis (like a parent's hospitalization), more support is expected. But the author is still in a new job, and $100 might be a start. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more. Since the author is not ignoring the problem but making a judgment based on the parents' history, it's more of a personal choice rather than wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
