My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom via an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The parents are broke, and the dad had a hospitalization for a psychotic break. The aunt criticized the amount, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and called the author stingy. The author's reasoning is that the parents are bad with money, so they don't want to send more to prevent it from being wasted. The author feels hurt but isn't angry.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The parents' financial situation is dire. However, the author's concern is that the parents might waste the money. The author is new to this job and might be on a tight budget themselves. The aunt's reaction seems harsh, suggesting that $100 isn't sufficient. But the author's reasoning is about financial responsibility, not stinginess. The parents' financial habits are a key point here. If they're known to waste money, the author's decision could be seen as protecting their own resources. On the other hand, the parents are in a crisis, and the author might have a moral obligation to help regardless. \n\nBut the author isn't refusing help entirely\u2014they did send $100. The issue is the amount. The author's reasoning is practical, based on the parents' past behavior. The aunt's passive-aggressiveness might be adding to the tension, but the core question is whether the author is wrong for not sending more. Since the author is balancing their own financial stability and the parents' spending habits, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the parents genuinely need more and the author can afford it, maybe there's a responsibility to give more. But given the context, the author's decision seems reasonable. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
