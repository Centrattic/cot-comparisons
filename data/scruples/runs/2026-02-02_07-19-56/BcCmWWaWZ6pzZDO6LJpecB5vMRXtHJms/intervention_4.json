I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The author moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break, and they sent $100 to their parents through an aunt. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, and the author didn't send more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They mention that their parents are bad with money, so they sent $100 to avoid them wasting more. The author is probably in a new job, maybe just starting out, so their income might be limited. They also have to cover their own expenses in a new city. Sending $100 might be a reasonable amount they can afford without compromising their own needs. The author isn't mad, but feels hurt, which suggests they care but have limits.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are in a difficult situation with a hospitalized parent and a young brother. $100 might not go far enough, especially if they have debts or high expenses. The aunt's reaction highlights the potential inadequacy of the amount. The author's reasoning is about preventing waste, but maybe the parents genuinely need more help regardless of their financial habits. There's also the cultural context; in some cultures, supporting parents is expected, and the amount might be a point of contention.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's ability to give more, the parents' actual needs, and the author's reasons for not giving more. If the author can't afford more without harming their own well-being, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the parents are in dire need and the author has some flexibility, the argument could go the other way. The author's concern about money being wasted is valid, but maybe there's a middle ground, like setting up a structured support system instead of sending a lump sum.\n\nI should also think about the emotional aspect. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments and the author's hurt feelings indicate family dynamics that might influence perceptions. The author might feel pressured to give more than they can comfortably afford, which isn't fair. However, completely cutting off support when parents are in crisis could be seen as neglectful.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong if they're balancing their own financial stability while trying to help. However, there's room for improvement in communication and finding a way to support parents effectively without enabling poor financial habits. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they're being realistic about their resources and trying to help within their means.\n"
