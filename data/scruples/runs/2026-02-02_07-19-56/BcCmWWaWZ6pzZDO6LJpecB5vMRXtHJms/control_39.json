I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, the author sent $100 after moving to a new job and couldn't contact the mother. The aunt got upset, said $100 isn't enough, and called the author stingy. The author feels hurt, mentions they can survive on $20 a week, so they think $100 should last the family a few days. They didn't send more and now the aunt is messaging them about it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points here are the parents' financial situation, the author's reasoning for not sending more, and the aunt's reaction.\n\nThe parents are described as \"basically broke,\" which is a serious situation. The author's dad was hospitalized, so there might be additional expenses. The author sent $100 via the aunt because they couldn't contact their mom. The aunt is passive-aggressive and argues that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money wasted, given their parents' poor money management. However, the author also mentions they can survive on $20 a week, implying that they might be in a position where they can give more but choose not to.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author is in a new job and has just received their first paycheck, so their financial situation might be tight. They made a choice based on their parents' past behavior. But the parents are in a crisis: a mental health issue and being broke. The aunt is acting as an intermediary, which complicates things. The author's decision not to send more could be seen as stingy, especially if the parents are in dire need. However, the author is also protecting the money from being mismanaged. \n\nThere's a balance here. On one hand, the parents might genuinely need more support. On the other, the author's concern about waste is valid. The author's statement about surviving on $20 a week suggests they might have the means to give more, but they're choosing not to. But is that their responsibility? If the parents are unable to manage money due to their circumstances, the author might feel they need to provide in a way that ensures it's used appropriately. However, cutting off support entirely because of past behavior could be seen as not helping in a time of need.\n\nThe aunt's reaction could be justified if the $100 is insufficient, but being passive-aggressive isn't helpful. The author might not be in the wrong for not sending more, especially if there's no guarantee the money would be used wisely. But maybe they should have discussed the issue more directly with their parents instead of through the aunt. However, the author couldn't reach their mom, so using the aunt as a go-between is understandable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author is in a position to help, but their parents have a history of mismanaging funds, it's a tough spot. The author's choice might be seen as self-protective rather than stingy. But the amount sent could be considered inadequate given the situation. The question is whether $100 is unreasonable. If the author can afford more and the parents are in crisis, maybe they should contribute more. But the author's reasoning is to prevent waste, which is a common dilemma in such cases.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a judgment call based on their parents' behavior. However, there's a middle ground, like sending a bit more or discussing how the money will be used. But since they couldn't contact their parents, using the aunt was the next best option. The aunt's reaction is harsh, but the author's decision is based on valid concerns. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
