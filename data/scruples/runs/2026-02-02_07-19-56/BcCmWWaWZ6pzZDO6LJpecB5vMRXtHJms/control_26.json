I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not giving their parents more money. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The aunt was upset about the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The user's reasoning is that they don't want the money to be wasted since their parents are bad with money. The user feels hurt but isn't mad. They think $100 should last a few days.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the parents' financial situation, the user's new job and paycheck, the communication through the aunt, and the user's concerns about money misuse. The aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, calling the user stingy. The user isn't mad but feels hurt.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, supporting family is often seen as a responsibility, especially if they're in need. However, the user is in a new job and might have their own financial constraints. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" so the user's hesitation to send more might be understandable. The user sent $100 initially, which might be a reasonable amount depending on their income and the parents' needs. But the aunt argues it's not enough for a family of three. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The user didn't directly contact their parents, opting to use an aunt. The aunt's reaction might have been unexpected, but the user's intention wasn't malicious; they wanted to avoid waste. The user's hurt feelings suggest they care, but they're also trying to manage their own resources responsibly.\n\nIn many cases, people expect their children to help financially when in need, but there's also the responsibility of the parents to manage money wisely. If the parents are struggling, maybe there's a system in place or a plan to avoid waste. However, the user might not have the means to support them beyond a certain point, especially in a new job where they might need to establish savings.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? On one hand, they sent some money, showed concern, and had a reason to limit the amount. On the other hand, the parents are in a tough spot, and $100 might not be sufficient. But the user isn't ignoring them; they're just being cautious. The aunt's reaction is part of the problem, and the user isn't mad, just hurt. \n\nConsidering all that, the user's actions seem reasonable. They're trying to help without enabling poor financial habits. The parents' responsibility is also part of the issue here. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
