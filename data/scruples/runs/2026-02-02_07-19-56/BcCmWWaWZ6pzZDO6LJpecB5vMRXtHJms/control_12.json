I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the author sent $100 but the aunt criticized them for it being too little. The author explains they didn't send more because they don't want the money to be wasted. The aunt says $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author isn't mad but feels hurt.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the parents' financial situation, their inability to manage money, the author's concern about waste, and the aunt's reaction. The author is in a new job and maybe new to handling their own finances. The question is whether the author's decision is wrong.\n\nFirst, the parents being broke and the dad's hospitalization adds context. The author might be trying to help but is cautious. Sending $100 might be a starting point, but the aunt argues it's insufficient. However, the author's reasoning is based on the past behavior of the parents mismanaging money, which is a valid concern. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to protect their own resources and ensuring the money is used appropriately. The aunt's passive-aggressive remarks might be part of the issue here, but the author's actions are based on their own judgment and past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation of more support from adult children, especially when parents are in crisis. But the author isn't refusing help entirely; they sent some amount. The problem is the quantity. However, the author's reasoning for not sending more is understandable. They can't control how the money is spent, and avoiding waste is a legitimate concern. The author is also new to the job, so their financial stability might be a factor. The aunt's criticism might stem from her own perspective, not necessarily the author's responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a judgment based on available information and past experiences. The answer would be B (No).\n"
