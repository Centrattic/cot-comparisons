I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their parents through an aunt because they couldn't reach their mom directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the parents to waste the money, and they think $100 could last a few days. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are described as \"basically broke,\" and the dad had a psychotic break. The author is new to the job, so maybe they have limited income. They sent $100 as their first paycheck. The aunt is passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author didn't send more because they think the parents can't manage money well. \n\nNow, the author's perspective is that they're trying to help but avoid enabling bad financial habits. The aunt's side is that it's insufficient. But is the author wrong for not sending more? It depends on a few factors. \n\nIf the author is in a financial situation where sending more would hurt them, maybe they're not wrong. However, if they have the means to give more and their parents are in dire need, others might see it as their responsibility. However, the parents' poor money management is a key point. The author's intention is to help without enabling waste, which is a reasonable concern. \n\nBut is there an expectation for the child to support their parents? In some cultures or families, yes. The author might feel obligated, but if they're in a new job and have their own expenses, they might have limits. The fact that they sent $100 at all shows they're trying to help. \n\nThe aunt's reaction is also part of the issue. Maybe the aunt is trying to put pressure on the author. The author didn't respond to the outburst and isn't angry, just hurt. They also mention they can survive on $20 a week, implying they're stretching their own resources. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They're making a judgment based on their parents' financial habits, and while $100 might be insufficient, the author's decision is based on trying to prevent waste. The parents are in a crisis (father's hospitalization), but the author's own financial situation (new job) is a factor. \n\nIn the end, it's about whether the author's action is considered stingy or reasonable. If the parents can't manage money, sending more might be counterproductive. The author's choice to send $100 might be seen as a responsible decision, even if it's not enough. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
