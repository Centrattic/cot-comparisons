I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author has just moved to a new city for a job and their dad had a psychotic break, which probably added stress. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt got upset, saying it wasn't enough and that the family of three can't survive on that. The parents are described as bad with money, so the author is worried they'd spend the extra money irresponsibly. The author didn't send more and now the aunt is passive-aggressive. The author feels hurt but isn't mad. They mention they can survive on $20 a week, implying their own financial constraints.\n\nSo, the key points are: financial responsibility vs. family expectations. The author is in a new job, possibly with limited income, and is cautious about giving more money because of the parents' financial habits. The aunt is pushing for more, arguing about the family's needs. The author's reasoning is pragmatic, but the emotional aspect is causing tension.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have the right to manage their own finances. If they believe giving more would be wasted, that's their judgment. However, the parents are in a tough spot, and maybe the author could have communicated better. But the parents' poor money management is their own issue. The author isn't obligated to support them financially beyond their own comfort. The aunt's reactions might be part of the problem here. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary, especially if they can't afford to give more. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
