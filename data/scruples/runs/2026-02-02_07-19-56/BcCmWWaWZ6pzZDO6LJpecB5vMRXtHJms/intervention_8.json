My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author just got their first paycheck after moving to a new city for a job. Their dad had a psychotic break, so the family is in a tough spot financially. The author sent $100 to their mom through an aunt, but the aunt was upset that it was too little. The parents are known to be bad with money, so the author decided not to send more to prevent them from wasting it. The aunt called them stingy, and the author is now questioning if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money to be wasted. On the other hand, the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, implying they might not have much to spare. They feel hurt and aren't mad at the aunt.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author might believe they're acting responsibly by not giving more money that could be mismanaged. However, the parents' needs are real\u2014they're in a crisis situation. The amount might be insufficient, but the author isn't in a position to give more. Is the author at fault for not giving more? Or is it a matter of differing priorities?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural expectations, personal responsibility, and the understanding of the parent's situation. Since the parents are in a crisis and the author is trying to help but also has constraints, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The aunt's reaction might be over the top, but the author's choice is based on practical considerations. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to be sure.\n"
