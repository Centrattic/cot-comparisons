She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for not giving their parents more money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person moved to a new city for a job, just got their first paycheck, and sent $100 to their mom through an aunt. The parents are described as \"basically broke,\" and the dad had a psychotic break. The aunt criticized the amount as too little, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The author explains they didn't send more because they think their parents waste money. The aunt was passive-aggressive, and now the author is being questioned further.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not sending more. Let's break it down. The key points here are the author's responsibility towards their parents, their own financial situation, and the parents' financial habits. The author is concerned about their parents' poor money management, so they send a smaller amount. The aunt argues that $100 isn't enough. The author isn't angry but hurt, thinking $100 could last a few days.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, it's a complex situation. On one hand, the parents are in financial trouble and have a family to support. The author might feel a duty to help. On the other hand, the parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" implying that giving more could lead to misuse. The author is trying to manage their own finances as a new employee, so giving more might not be feasible.\n\nThe author's decision is based on practicality and preventing waste. The aunt's reaction seems to be more about the amount rather than the reasoning. The author isn't refusing help entirely but is being cautious. There's no indication that the author is withholding all support. The $100 is a gesture, even if it's a small amount. However, the parents' need for more money is real, so the author might be questioned about why they don't find a middle ground or a better way to ensure the money is used appropriately.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Is the author responsible for their parents' financial mistakes? Arguably, the parents are responsible for their own financial management. The author is within their rights to be cautious. However, in some cultural contexts, there's an expectation for children to support their parents regardless of the parents' habits. The answer might depend on that context, but since it's not specified, we have to go with general principles.\n\nThe author's explanation is valid, but some might argue that the amount is too low regardless. The key is intent. The author isn't being stingy out of spite but to prevent waste. The hurt feelings might be because of perceived stinginess, but the author's reasoning is different. So, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a close call. They could be seen as balancing their own situation and their parents' behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
