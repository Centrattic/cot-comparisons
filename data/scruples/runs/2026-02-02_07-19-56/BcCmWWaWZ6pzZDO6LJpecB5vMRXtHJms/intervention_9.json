I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, especially since the parents are bad with money. The author explained they didn't send more to prevent them from wasting it. The aunt kept messaging, and the author feels hurt but isn't mad. They're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're young, just started a new job, and in a new city. Maybe they have their own expenses. They sent $100, which they thought was enough. They also made a conscious decision not to send more because they don't want their parents to waste the money. That shows they're trying to be practical, even if their parents might need more.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are described as \"broke\" with a dad recently hospitalized. The aunt argues that $100 isn't enough for three people. The author's reasoning is based on preventing waste, but maybe the parents actually need more. The author's decision might seem selfish, but they might not have the means or the trust to give more. They might be in a financial position where they can't afford to give more, or they don't want to create dependency.\n\nCultural factors could play a role here too. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, and not doing so might be seen as wrong. However, the author's reasoning is about preventing misuse, which could be a valid concern. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might add stress, but the author's intent was to help without enabling bad financial habits.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the parents genuinely need more money and the author can afford to give more, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if the author can't afford more or has a valid reason to limit the amount, then they might not be. The key factors are the parents' actual needs, the author's financial capability, and the reasoning behind the amount given.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the $100 is insufficient and they can give more. If they can't, then maybe not. The problem is the uncertainty around the parents' needs and the author's financial situation. The author's explanation about preventing waste is a good point, but if the parents are in crisis, the amount might still be too low regardless of the reasoning.\n"
