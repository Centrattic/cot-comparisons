I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's parents are described as \"basically broke,\" and the father had a psychotic break. The author just got their first paycheck and sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and called the author stingy. The author explains that they didn't send more to avoid their parents wasting the money. They feel hurt but aren't mad and don't plan to send more.\n\nSo, the key points here: the parents are in a difficult financial situation and there's a health issue. The author is in a new job and sent some money but not more. The aunt is upset, but the author stands by their decision.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. From one angle, the parents need help, and the author has the means to send more. The author's reasoning is that the parents might waste the money. But is that a valid reason to not send more? Maybe the author could have given more but set boundaries, like explaining the condition of the money being used for essentials. However, the author didn't do that. They just sent $100 without explaining their reasoning to the parents, only to the aunt.\n\nBut the author is also new to this job and might be managing their own finances. Sending $100 is a gesture, but if the family is in dire need, maybe the author should contribute more. However, the author's concern about misuse is a common issue. It's a conflict between wanting to help and not wanting to enable poor financial habits.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be obligated to support their parents financially unless there's a legal or cultural expectation. If they chose to help, the amount they consider appropriate is subjective. The aunt's reaction might be based on her own perspective, not the author's financial situation. The author's hurt feelings suggest that this is a personal conflict, not just a financial one. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on context. If the parents are in need and the author can afford to help more, maybe they should. But the author's decision to not send more to prevent misuse is understandable. The author isn't obligated to give more than they're comfortable with, especially if they believe it won't be used responsibly. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
