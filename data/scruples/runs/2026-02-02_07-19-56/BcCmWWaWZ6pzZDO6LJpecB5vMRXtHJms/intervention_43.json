I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100 to the mom via an aunt. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, and the author didn't send more to prevent the parents from wasting the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a new job, so maybe they're establishing their own financial independence. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" which is a key point. The author's reasoning is that if they send more, it might be wasted, so they limit it to $100. The aunt is passive-aggressive, which might be causing tension.\n\nI should think about cultural expectations here. In some cultures, supporting parents financially is expected, especially when they're in need. However, the author is concerned about the parents' financial habits. There's a balance between helping and enabling. If the parents are genuinely unable to manage money, maybe the author's approach is cautious.\n\nAlso, the amount sent: $100 for a family of three. Depending on where they live, $100 might not go far. But the author thinks it's enough for a few days. The aunt argues it's not enough. The author isn't mad, just hurt. Their reasoning is practical, but the emotional aspect is important here.\n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on perspective. If the parents need more help and the author has the means to provide, maybe they should consider sending more. But if the author's intention is to avoid enabling poor financial habits, that's a valid concern. The key is whether the author has a responsibility to help despite the parents' behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is making a deliberate choice based on their assessment of the parents' situation, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the parents are in dire need and the author is withholding help without a valid reason, that's another angle. The author's reasoning is valid, but the aunt's reaction adds complexity. The author might be right to set boundaries but could also be seen as not contributing enough given the parents' circumstances.\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, helping family in need is a moral duty. However, if enabling harmful behavior isn't in their best interest, there's a counterargument. The author's hurt feelings suggest they feel conflicted. The answer might hinge on whether the author's decision is compassionate yet realistic. The aunt's judgment doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong, but it does indicate a cultural expectation of support.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a reasoned decision based on their understanding of the parents' habits. However, there's a middle ground where they could offer help in a way that encourages better financial management. But given the current situation, the author's choice to send $100 seems like a reasonable attempt to help without enabling. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
