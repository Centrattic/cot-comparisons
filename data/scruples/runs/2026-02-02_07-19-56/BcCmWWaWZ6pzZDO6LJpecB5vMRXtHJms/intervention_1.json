I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's parents are broke, and the dad had a psychotic break. The author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom via an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt was upset about the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three and called the author stingy. The author explains they didn't send more to prevent the parents from wasting it. They're hurt but not mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They might be in a new job, possibly not earning a lot yet, and want to manage their own finances. They're also worried about their parents misusing the money, which could lead to more problems. The parents' financial habits are bad, so over time, giving more might not be helpful. The author's intention was to help but also set a boundary to avoid enabling poor financial decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt's reaction is that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. That's a valid point because basic needs like food and essentials can cost more. The parents are in a crisis with the father hospitalized, so maybe they need more immediate support. The author's decision might be seen as not providing adequate help during a tough time. However, the author's reasoning is to prevent waste, which is a concern. Maybe there's a middle ground, like giving a bit more but setting conditions or monitoring how the money is used.\n\nThe author's emotional response is hurt, which suggests they feel guilty or worried about being seen as selfish. They might not have enough resources to give more without compromising their own stability. It's a tough balance between helping family and personal financial health.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at the situation, the parents are in a dire situation with a medical crisis. The author's contribution, while well-intentioned, might be insufficient. However, the author is also considering the parents' past behavior. The aunt's criticism is about the amount being too low, but the author's stance is about preventing misuse. It's a conflict between immediate need and long-term consequences.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they are making a judgment call based on their understanding of their parents' behavior. However, maybe they could have communicated better or found a way to support without enabling. But given the information, the author's position is understandable. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
