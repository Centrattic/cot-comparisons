I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt was upset and said $100 isn't enough for a family of three, especially since the parents are broke and the dad had a psychotic break. The author explained they didn't want the money wasted, but the aunt was passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. Now the aunt is apologizing and the author is hurt and not sending more.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the parents to waste the money. The aunt's side is that $100 isn't enough. The parents have financial issues and a sick parent, which adds to the problem.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that giving more could lead to misuse. They might be trying to help without enabling poor financial habits. But the parents are in a tough spot with a hospitalized father and a younger brother. The author's $100 might not be sufficient for their needs, especially if they have to cover basics like food and medical expenses.\n\nHowever, the author is in a new job, so maybe they have limited funds themselves. The post mentions they can survive on $20 a week, which suggests they're living frugally. But is $100 a week enough for a family of three? Maybe not, depending on their location and living costs. But the author's responsibility could be seen as helping their family in need, even if they have to be cautious.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be valid because the parents are in a crisis. However, the author's concern about misuse is also a point. The key here is whether the author is being stingy or making a reasonable choice. If the author is in a new job and the $100 is all they can afford, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they can afford more and are withholding it solely due to distrust, that might be a problem.\n\nThe author didn't respond to the aunt's outburst and didn't send more. They feel hurt but not mad. The parents are struggling, and the author might be trying to balance helping without enabling. It's a tough spot. The answer might depend on cultural expectations, financial capability, and the reasonableness of the amount given the situation.\n"
