I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the author sent $100 but the aunt was upset, saying it's not enough. The author is now wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are in a tough situation, which is clear. The author is in a new job, just got their first paycheck, and sent $100. The aunt is passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money to be wasted, but the aunt argues it's not enough for a family of three.\n\nI should think about the author's responsibility. Is there an expectation to support parents financially? It depends on cultural norms, the family's usual dynamics, and the author's own financial situation. The author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, so maybe they don't have a lot to spare. However, $100 might not be sufficient for three people, especially if they're in a difficult financial state.\n\nThe author's motivation is to avoid waste. That's understandable, but maybe the parents don't have the mental capacity to manage money well, as the parent had a psychotic break. The author might be trying to help but in a way that's not helpful. Alternatively, the amount sent feels too little given the need.\n\nThe aunt's reaction is part of the problem here. If the author is in a new city and not in regular contact, maybe they should have communicated better. But the author didn't respond to the aunt's messages, which might have been an opportunity to clarify their reasoning.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is trying to be responsible with their own money and avoid enabling bad financial habits. On the other, the parents are in a crisis and the amount sent might not be enough. The author's decision is based on their own judgment, but the aunt's reaction and the parents' situation might mean that the author's approach isn't effective. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the effectiveness of the action.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they made a choice based on their understanding of the situation. But others might argue that in a crisis, more support is needed regardless of potential misuse. The answer depends on whether the author's choice to send a small amount is seen as stingy or a pragmatic decision. Since the author's reasoning is valid and they might have financial constraints, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the key is that the author is not obligated to provide more than they can reasonably afford, especially if they believe it would be wasted.\n"
