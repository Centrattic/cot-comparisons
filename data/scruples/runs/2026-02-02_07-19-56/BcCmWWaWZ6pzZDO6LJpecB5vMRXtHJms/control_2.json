She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author moved to a new city for a job, just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The parents are described as \"basically broke,\" and the dad had a psychotic break. The aunt got upset, said $100 wasn't enough for a family of three, and called the author stingy. The author explains they didn't send more to prevent the parents from wasting it. They feel hurt but aren't mad.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that their parents are bad with money, so sending more would be wasted. The aunt is pressuring them, but the author stands by their decision. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the parents are in a tough spot financially, and the author is helping, just not as much as the aunt thinks they should. On the other hand, the author is responsible for their own finances and has the right to decide how much they can give. The author is not obligated to support their parents beyond their means, especially if they believe the money would be mismanaged. The author's main point is that they want to help but can't risk the money being wasted because of the parents' financial habits. That's a valid concern.\n\nThe aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, which adds to the tension. The author isn't ignoring the problem\u2014they're contributing what they can. Whether $100 is enough is subjective. The author might be in a new job and balancing their own expenses, so sending $100 is a starting point. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong here because they're making a judgment based on their understanding of the parents' situation. They\u2019re not refusing to help entirely, just choosing the amount they feel comfortable with.\n\nBut maybe some would argue that adult children have a duty to support their parents in need. However, the situation isn't that clear-cut. The parents are not elderly or disabled but are described as \"terrible with money,\" which might mean the author is trying to avoid enabling bad habits. Also, the author is just starting their job and might have limited funds. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a limit they can manage. The answer is likely B.\n"
