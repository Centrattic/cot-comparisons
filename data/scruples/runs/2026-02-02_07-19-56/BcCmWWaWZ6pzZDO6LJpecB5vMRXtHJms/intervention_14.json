I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that their parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the person sent $100. The aunt is upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author explains they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt is passive-aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal factors. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, especially if they're in need. The author might feel obligated but also wants to avoid financial waste. The parents being bad with money is a key point. The author might be protecting their own finances and preventing misuse. However, sending $100 might be seen as insufficient by others, especially if it's hard to meet basic needs. \n\nThe author's justification is that they can survive on $20 a week, implying they're not in a position to give more. But maybe they should consider their parents' situation more. The parents have a mental health issue and a younger brother. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if they fear the money will be mismanaged. But others might argue that they should help despite the parents' habits. \n\nAlso, the aunt's reaction is important. She's the one who escalated the issue. The author didn't send more, but the aunt's passive-aggressiveness might be part of the problem. The author's decision could be seen as self-preservation, but in a family context, there's often an expectation of support. However, the author isn't obligated to give more if it's not their responsibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they have their own financial responsibilities and the parents squander money, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if there's an expectation of support and they can afford to give more, maybe they are. The situation is a bit nuanced. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the actual financial ability of the author. Since the author is just starting their job and might be on a tight budget, maybe they're not at fault. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
