I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. The situation involves the author's parents being broke, the father recently hospitalized, and the author sending $100 to a relative who then criticized the amount.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a new city, just got their first paycheck, and can't reach their mom. They send $100 via an aunt. The aunt is upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, and the author explains they don't want them to waste money. The author isn't mad but feels hurt.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the parents are bad with money, so sending more might not be wise. They also mention they can survive on $20 a week, implying they're not in a financial position to give more. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments and the stress of family dynamics add to the situation.\n\nEthically, this is a tough spot. On one hand, family support is important, especially when parents are struggling. On the other, the author isn't financially obligated to support their parents, especially if they're an adult with their own expenses. The key points here are the author's financial constraints, the parents' money management issues, and the author's attempt to help within their means.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to help entirely, just choosing an amount they can manage. The aunt's reaction might stem from her own perspective, but the author isn't required to meet others' expectations. The fact that the author is in a new city and has their own job suggests they're prioritizing their new responsibilities, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, some might argue that children have a duty to support their parents. However, without a legal obligation, it's a personal choice. The author's decision to send money at all shows some level of support. The explanation given to the aunt about avoiding waste is a reasonable justification, even if the aunt disagrees.\n\nEmotional aspects include the author feeling hurt but not angry, which indicates they're aware of the situation's sensitivity. They're being truthful about their financial limits. The parents' situation is dire, but the author's responsibility isn't absolute. They can't be expected to solve their parents' financial problems entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their circumstances and the understanding that their parents might not use more money wisely. The aunt's criticism is valid from her perspective, but the author isn't obligated to comply. The answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
