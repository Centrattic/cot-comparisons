      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe person moved to a new city for a job and their dad had a psychotic break, which probably makes things even harder for their parents. They just got their first paycheck and sent $100 to their mom via an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and was passive-aggressive. The author didn't respond and didn't send more. The aunt kept messaging, and the author feels hurt but isn't mad. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not sending more money.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The parents are \"basically broke,\" so they might be in a tough spot. The author is in a new city, starting a job, so maybe their resources are limited too. They might not have a lot of money yet. Sending $100 could be a gesture of help, but the aunt is saying it's not enough. The author is concerned about the parents wasting the money, so they decided not to send more. The aunt is being passive-aggressive and calling them stingy.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if they send more, the parents might waste it. So they want to avoid that. But the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough to feed three people. The author is hurt but not mad. They mention that they can survive on $20 a week, implying they're living frugally. Maybe they're in a position where they can't afford to send more?\n\nI need to think about different perspectives. On one hand, the parents are in a crisis situation (dad hospitalized), which is a serious issue. The author might feel a responsibility to help, but they also don't want the money misused. On the other hand, the aunt's criticism suggests that $100 is insufficient, and the author's refusal might be seen as not supporting their family in need. The author's reasoning about preventing waste is a valid concern, but maybe they should have communicated better or found a different way to help, like setting up a budget or monitoring expenses. Alternatively, maybe the parents need more immediate financial support regardless of how they spend it.\n\nAnother angle is the cultural context. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, and not providing enough could be seen as neglectful. However, the author is in a new job, so maybe they're not yet in a stable financial position. The amount sent could be considered a start, but the parents have three people to feed. $100 might not stretch far enough in their location, especially if they're in a place with high costs.\n\nThe author's decision to not send more is based on preventing waste, but maybe they could have addressed the underlying issue of the parents' financial mismanagement instead of just withholding money. For example, setting up a system where the parents can only spend the money on essentials. However, that's complicated and might not be feasible.\n\nThe aunt's reaction is also part of the problem. She's acting as a mediator and is being critical, which adds to the tension. The author might feel attacked, but the aunt's concerns might have merit. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for their decision.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the parents are in a dire situation, the author might feel they should contribute more. However, if the author's financial situation is also precarious, they might not be able to give more. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money to be wasted, which is a valid concern. However, not providing any additional support might leave the parents without necessary resources.\n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have valid concerns about mismanagement. However, the amount they sent might be considered insufficient by others, suggesting they could have given more. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances, like the parents' location, the cost of living, and the author's own financial stability. Since the author can survive on $20 a week, they might have some financial cushion, but maybe not enough to give more. Alternatively, $100 could be a reasonable first gesture, but the parents might need more. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for critique about the amount given. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) but with some caveats.\n"
