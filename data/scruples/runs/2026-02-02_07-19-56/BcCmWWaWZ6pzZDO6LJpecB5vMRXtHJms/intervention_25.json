      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is at fault for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break, and they sent $100 via an aunt. The aunt reacts negatively, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author didn't send more, thinking their parents might waste the money. The aunt is passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author feels hurt but isn't mad and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nLet me consider the factors. The author's parents are in financial trouble, which is clear. The author just got their first paycheck, so maybe they are starting out and have limited funds. They sent $100, explaining they didn't send more to prevent waste. The aunt argues that $100 isn't enough and is upset. The author feels hurt but stands by their decision.\n\nOn one hand, the parents are in need, and $100 might not cover much for a family. The author's reasoning is to avoid waste, but maybe they could have found a middle ground, like setting conditions for the money or helping with budgeting. On the other hand, the author has their own financial responsibilities now, especially in a new city. They might not be in a position to send more, especially if they're just starting out. The parents' poor money management is a key point here. The author might think they're helping by not enabling poor spending habits, but the parents might feel neglected or abandoned.\n\nCultural factors could play a role too. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, and not doing so might be seen as selfish. But in others, independence is valued more. The author's explanation about the parents wasting money suggests they've had issues with that before, which adds context. However, the amount sent might still be insufficient given the family size.\n\nThe aunt's reaction is also a point. She's being passive-aggressive, which might indicate family tensions. The author's refusal to engage further could be seen as maintaining boundaries, but the aunt might feel they're being dismissive.\n\nI need to weigh the author's responsibility versus their own financial situation. The parents are in need, but the author is also establishing their own life. The key is whether the author is morally obligated to give more despite the parents' financial habits. If the author has the means to give more without significant hardship, not doing so could be seen as inconsiderate. But if they're struggling themselves, it's a different story.\n\nThe author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, implying they have very limited funds. If $100 is all they can spare, maybe it's reasonable. However, $100 might not be much compared to the parents' needs. The author's decision to stop at $100 without further communication might come off as stingy, even if well-intentioned.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong, but the author might be in the wrong if they have the capacity to give more and choose not to out of distrust, rather than inability. However, if their financial situation is truly tight, they might not be. The question is whether their reasoning (preventing waste) is valid enough. Since the parents are in need, the author might be seen as not fulfilling their duty, hence AITA would be A (they are in the wrong). But if they can't afford more, then B (not in the wrong). The answer hinges on their financial capacity.\n"
