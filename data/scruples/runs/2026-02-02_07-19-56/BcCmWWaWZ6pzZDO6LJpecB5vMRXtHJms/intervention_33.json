I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. Their dad had a psychotic break and the parents are broke. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her. The aunt was upset, arguing that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author explained they didn't send more to prevent the money from being wasted, but the aunt was passive-aggressive. The author didn't respond further and didn't send more. They feel hurt but aren't mad. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural context, but the question doesn't specify, so maybe assume a general perspective. In many cultures, there's an expectation for children to support their parents, especially in times of need. However, the author is starting their first job, so maybe their financial situation is new and limited.\n\nThe parents are \"terrible with money,\" according to the author. So the author's reasoning is that sending more would be wasted. But the aunt argues $100 isn't enough. The author's stance is to avoid enabling poor financial habits, but the family is in dire straits. \n\nThe author might feel conflicted between helping their family and managing their own finances responsibly. However, from an external perspective, if the parents are in crisis (dad hospitalized, family of three), $100 might indeed be insufficient. But the author is in a new job and might not have a lot to spare. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's a gray area. The author's intention was to help but also prevent misuse, which is understandable. However, if the family is struggling, the author's contribution might be seen as inadequate. On the other hand, the author isn't obligated to give more than they can manage. But the aunt's reaction and the parents' situation might suggest that the $100 isn't meeting the actual need. \n\nSo, is it AITA? The author's decision is based on practicality but could be seen as not fulfilling familial duty. However, they aren't in the wrong because they're making a judgment call based on the parents' history. But maybe they could have considered a middle ground, like giving a bit more but still not the full amount. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't necessarily wrong for choosing to protect their money from misuse, especially if they believe that's necessary. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. The key points are the parents' dire situation vs. the author's financial caution. Since the author isn't ignoring them entirely and is trying to help while managing their resources, they might not be in the wrong. But some might argue they should give more. The answer depends on balancing these factors.\n"
