I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not giving their parents more money. The parent situation is tough: they're broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the parents are described as bad with money. The author sent $100, which an aunt criticized as too little. The author's reasoning is that more money might be wasted.\n\nFirst, the author is in a new job and just got their first paycheck. They're probably still adjusting to their new city and workload. Sending $100 seems like a gesture, but the aunt argues it's insufficient for a family of three. The parents' financial instability is a key point here. The author is trying to help but wants to prevent misuse. \n\nIs the author wrong for limiting the amount? Well, they're not obligated to give more. The parents have a history of poor money management, so the author's caution makes sense. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might reflect her own feelings rather than the author's responsibility. The author isn't ignoring the situation but is making a judgment based on available info. \n\nThe parents might need help beyond just money, like budgeting, but the author isn't in a position to enforce that. The fact that they sent $100 shows they are contributing, even if it's not the amount others expect. The author's hurt feelings suggest they're aware of the criticism but stand by their decision. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a choice to send a manageable amount while considering their parents' tendencies. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
