I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not giving their parents more money. The situation is that the author moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break, and the author sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author explains they didn't want the money wasted, but the aunt was passive-aggressive and called them stingy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They just got their first paycheck and are probably managing their own finances in a new city. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" so the author's reasoning is that sending more might be wasted. The author also mentions they can survive on $20 a week, implying they have a tight budget. They sent $100 thinking it would last a few days for the family. \n\nOn the other hand, the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The parents are broke, and the father's hospitalization might mean they have significant expenses. The aunt is concerned about their well-being. The author isn't mad, but is hurt by the aunt's reaction. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, financial responsibility is subjective. The author is trying to help but is cautious about the parents' spending habits. However, the parents' situation might be dire. The author might be in a position where they can give more, especially if they can survive on $20 a week. But maybe they have other expenses in their new city that aren't mentioned. \n\nIt's also about expectations. The aunt's reaction suggests that the family expects more support, especially in a crisis (father's hospitalization). The author's decision to send less might be seen as stingy by family members who have different views on financial responsibility. \n\nBut the author isn't refusing help entirely. They did send $100. The question is whether that's enough. The key points are the parents' financial state, the author's own financial situation, and the reasonableness of $100. If the author can afford more and the parents genuinely can't make ends meet, the author might be expected to give more. However, if the parents are wasteful, the author's caution is understandable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether $100 is a reasonable amount given the context. If the author has the means to contribute more and the parents are in a dire situation, then the author might be seen as not supporting enough. But if the parents are mismanaging money, the author's decision is justified. However, the author's own statement that they can live on $20 a week suggests they might have some flexibility. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they did send help and have a reason to be cautious. But the aunt's argument about the amount being insufficient could imply the author could do more. However, the parents' behavior affects the author's decision. It's a tough balance. Maybe the author isn't wrong, but could consider finding a middle ground. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made a choice based on their judgment of their parents' financial habits and their own situation. The aunt's criticism might be harsh, but the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
