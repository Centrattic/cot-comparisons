I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation involves the parents being broke, the dad recently hospitalized for a psychotic break, and the author sending $100, which an aunt criticized as insufficient. The author explains they sent that amount to avoid money being wasted, and the aunt argues it's not enough for a family of three.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial expectations. In some cultures, supporting parents financially is expected, especially when they're in need. The author's reasoning is that the parents misuse money, but that's their justification. The aunt's reaction might reflect that expectation, even if she's passive-aggressive. However, the author is in a new job and just started, so their financial situation might be tight too. The amount sent, $100, might not be enough in some contexts but could be all the author can spare.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author feels hurt because they think $100 is sufficient, but the aunt insists it's not. The question is whether the author is being stingy or being practical. The parents' financial mismanagement is a key point here. If the author sends more, there's a risk the parents will waste it, which could cause further issues. But if the parents are truly in need and in crisis (dad's hospitalization), maybe the author should consider alternative ways to help, like managing the funds or providing support in other forms.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're not mad but hurt, indicating they're making a conscious choice based on their judgment. The aunt's messages after the fact show ongoing concern, but the author hasn't responded. The dilemma is balancing personal financial responsibility with familial obligations. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't legally obligated to help, but socially or culturally, there might be expectations. The decision to send a certain amount is based on the author's values and financial capacity. If the author can afford to send more without hardship, some might say they should. But if they're prioritizing their own financial stability while still contributing, others might see that as reasonable. \n\nThe key factors are the parents' ability to manage money, the author's financial situation, and the cultural context. Since the author is choosing to send money despite the parents' past behavior to avoid waste, it's a protective measure. However, the aunt's perspective highlights the immediate need of the family. Without more context on the author's financial constraints, it's hard to judge. But since the author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, maybe they can spare more. Yet, $100 might indeed be a starting point, and the author might need to communicate better with the family rather than just refusing to send more. \n\nOverall, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries to prevent misuse, but they might be missing an opportunity to help in a more structured way, like financial guidance or collaborative budgeting. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are seen as stingy or pragmatic.\n"
