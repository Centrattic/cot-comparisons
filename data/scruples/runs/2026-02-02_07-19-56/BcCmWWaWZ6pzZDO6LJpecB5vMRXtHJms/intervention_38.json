I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The author's parents are described as being broke, and the dad had a psychiatric hospitalization. The author sent $100 but the aunt was upset, arguing it wasn't enough for a family of three.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They chose $100 to avoid the parents from wasting the money. The aunt's reaction was passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author isn't angry but feels hurt, comparing their own ability to survive on $20 a week, implying they think $100 is sufficient for the parents for a few days.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have three people to support (parents and a brother), and $100 might not stretch very far for them, especially with a recent hospitalization. The aunt is likely advocating for the family's needs, so her concern might be valid. However, the author's reasoning is about preventing the parents from mismanaging funds. The key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not providing more money despite the aunt's arguments.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action is justified. Factors to consider: the author's financial situation, their responsibility towards their parents, the parents' financial habits, and cultural expectations. In some cultures, supporting parents is a duty, so sending more might be expected. However, the author is in a new job, maybe with limited income, and is concerned about misuse. \n\nThe author could be seen as balancing their own financial responsibility with family obligations. If the parents are in a crisis (hospitalization and financial instability), some might argue the author should contribute more. However, if the parents have a history of mismanaging money, the author's caution is understandable. The aunt's role as a mediator adds another layer; her passive-aggressiveness might not reflect the parents' actual needs but could be her own judgment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author has the means and the parents are in dire need, then not sending more could be seen as selfish. But if the parents are likely to waste the money, the author's decision is prudent. The author's own financial constraints (surviving on $20/week) might limit their ability to give more, but $100 seems low for a family of three, regardless of misuse. Maybe the author could find a middle ground, like sending a bit more while setting conditions or helping them manage the funds. However, the author's reasoning is to avoid waste, so maybe they believe that more would be squandered. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about context. If the author isn't obligated to support their parents financially, then they aren't in the wrong. If there's an expectation of support, then maybe they are. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. The author's decision isn't malicious, but the amount might be insufficient. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they are making a conscious decision to protect their resources despite the aunt's criticism. So, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the understanding that there's room for improvement in communication and possibly adjusting the amount based on actual needs versus misuse fears.\n"
