I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who sent $100 to their parents is in the wrong. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the author is in a new city with a new job. They sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for three people and called the author stingy.\n\nSo, first, the author is in a new job and might be on a tight budget themselves. They sent $100, which they might consider their limit because they don't want the parents to waste the money. The aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, which is adding to the tension. The author isn't mad but feels hurt. \n\nI need to consider cultural factors here. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their parents financially, especially if the parents are struggling. But if the author is also struggling or has their own financial responsibilities, that's a factor. The parents being bad with money complicates things\u2014maybe the author is trying to avoid enabling poor financial habits.\n\nThe key points are: the author sent money, even if it's a smaller amount, and made a reasoned decision based on their parents' history. The aunt's criticism might be part of the issue, but the parents haven't directly complained. The author's intention was to help without enabling waste, so maybe they're not in the wrong. On the other hand, some might argue that $100 isn't sufficient for a family of three, especially in times of crisis. But the author's perspective is that they can't afford more and are trying to be responsible. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions are considered reasonable given their circumstances. Since they made a conscious decision with their own financial limits and the parents' behavior in mind, they might not be in the wrong. The aunt's reaction could be part of the problem, but the author isn't necessarily at fault. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
