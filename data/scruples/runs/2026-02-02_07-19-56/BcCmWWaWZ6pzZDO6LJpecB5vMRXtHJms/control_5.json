      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is at fault for not sending more money to their parents.\n\nFirst, the background: The author's parents are broke, and the dad had a psychotic break. The author moved to a new city for a job and sent $100 to their mom through an aunt. The aunt was upset about the amount, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author explains that they didn't send more because they don't want the money to be wasted, as the parents are bad with money. The aunt was passive-aggressive, calling the author stingy, and now the author is hurt and unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author's parents are in a tough financial situation, which is exacerbated by the father's hospitalization. The author, now employed, sends $100 from their first paycheck. The aunt reacts negatively, arguing that the amount is insufficient. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money wasted, given the parents' financial habits.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms. In many cultures, especially in some Asian or close-knit families, there's an expectation for adult children to support their parents financially, especially when parents are in need. However, the author is in a new job, possibly has their own expenses, and is cautious about how the money is used. The parents being \"terrible with money\" is a significant factor here. If the author knows that sending more money would just be wasted, then not sending more might be a responsible decision.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The parents are in a crisis (father hospitalized), and the author is providing some support. The aunt's frustration might stem from the belief that $100 isn't enough. However, the author might not have the means to send more, or they might want to ensure the money is used appropriately. The author's hurt feelings suggest they feel unappreciated or criticized, even though their intention was to help.\n\nLegal right vs. moral obligation. Legally, there's no obligation unless there's a legal responsibility (like a court order), but that's not the case here. Morally, it's more complex. The author is helping by sending $100, but the amount is seen as insufficient. However, the author's reasoning about the parents' financial habits is valid. If the money would be mismanaged, then sending more could do more harm than good. Alternatively, maybe the author could set conditions for the money's use, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author sent money through an aunt because they couldn't reach their mom. The aunt then took the lead, which might have caused some miscommunication. The author could have directly communicated with their parents to understand their needs better. However, the author might not have that access, especially with a hospitalized parent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the expectations. If the expectation is to provide a certain amount regardless of the parents' financial habits, then the author might be seen as at fault. But if the parents are responsible for their financial mismanagement, the author isn't obligated to fund that. The author is making a choice based on their own judgment, perhaps to avoid enabling a cycle of financial irresponsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they made a reasoned decision based on their knowledge of their parents' habits and their own resources. However, the cultural context and family expectations might influence perceptions. The key here is the author's rationale being valid and their right to decide how much to give, especially when considering the parents' history of mismanaging money.\n"
