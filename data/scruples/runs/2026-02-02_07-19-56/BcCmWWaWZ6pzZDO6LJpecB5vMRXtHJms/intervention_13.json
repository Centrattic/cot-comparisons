I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the author moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break, and they sent $100 to their parents through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, and the author didn't send more, explaining they don't want the money wasted. Now, they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They have just started a new job and might be on a tight budget themselves. Sending $100 was their first paycheck, which is a significant portion of their income. They think the parents are bad with money, so they don't want to give more to prevent waste. They feel hurt but not angry.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt's reaction suggests that $100 isn't sufficient for a family's needs. The parents are described as \"broke,\" so maybe they need more support. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments and continued messaging indicate that the family might be expecting more financial help. The author's decision to not send more could be seen as stingy or not supporting their parents in a crisis, especially since the father is hospitalized.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is about preventing waste. They might be trying to balance helping without enabling poor financial habits. However, in times of crisis, like a parent's hospitalization, needs might be more immediate, and the family's perspective is that they need more help regardless of past behavior.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the author can't afford to give more, they might not be at fault. But if the parents are in a dire situation, the expectation might be for the author to contribute more, even if it's a struggle. The key points are the author's financial situation, the urgency of the parents' needs, and the family's expectations versus the author's judgment about money management.\n\nMaybe the middle ground is that the author isn't in the wrong for giving $100 if that's all they can spare, but perhaps there's a need for communication or a different approach. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the family's needs are severe, the author's decision could be seen as insufficient, making them at fault. But if they are doing what they can given their own circumstances, maybe not.\n"
