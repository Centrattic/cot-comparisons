I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The parents are described as \"basically broke,\" and the dad had a psychotic break recently. The aunt was upset that $100 wasn't enough, saying it's not enough for a family of three and called the author stingy. The author explains they didn't send more to prevent the money from being wasted, since the parents are bad with money. They feel hurt but aren't mad.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's consider the factors. The parents are in a financial crisis, which is bad. The author is new to a job, so their financial stability might be new. The author's reasoning is to avoid the money being wasted. But is that a valid reason? On one hand, the parents need the money. On the other, if they're terrible with money, sending more might not help and could lead to more problems. The author sent $100, which they think is a few days' worth, but the aunt argues it's not enough. The key here is whether the author's action is unreasonable given their circumstances.\n\nThe author's position is that they can survive on $20 a week, implying they have a low budget. If their first paycheck is just in, maybe they can't afford to send more. However, the parents have a younger brother to care for, so their financial needs are higher. But the author's concern about wastefulness complicates things. It's a common issue where people might give money but it doesn't last because of poor financial management.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on context. They did send something, and their reasoning is that they don't want to enable bad habits. However, in a crisis situation, not providing more might be seen as not supporting the family when they need it most. The aunt's reaction might be based on urgency, while the author is being cautious. There's no clear right or wrong, but the author is making a choice based on their judgment. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a decision based on their understanding of the parents' behavior. But if the parents are in dire need, maybe the author should have sent more despite the risk. However, the author's own financial situation is also a factor. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, since they made a choice based on their assessment of the situation.\n"
