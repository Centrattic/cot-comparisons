I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether not sending more money to their parents is the right decision.\n\nFirst, the author moved to a new city for a job, which probably means they're starting out and might have limited income. They just got their first paycheck. The parents are described as \"broke,\" and the dad had a serious health issue, a psychotic break, which adds to the stress. The author sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't reach their mom directly. \n\nThe aunt reacted negatively, saying $100 isn't enough and that the author is being stingy. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the parents to waste the money, implying financial irresponsibility on the parents' part. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments and subsequent messages make the author feel hurt but not angry.\n\nNow, considering cultural context, family expectations, and financial responsibility. In many cultures, supporting parents, especially in need, is expected. However, the author is also young, just starting their job, and might have their own expenses in a new city. They might not be in a position to give more yet. \n\nThe parents being \"terrible with money\" is a key point. If the author is concerned about the money being wasted, maybe setting up a structured way to help, like a direct deposit into a savings account or a specific bill payment, could be better. But the author's approach here is to send $100, which might be seen as insufficient given the family's situation. \n\nThe aunt's reaction highlights that $100 isn't enough for a family of three, which might be true if they're struggling. The author's decision not to send more could be seen as not fulfilling their duty, especially considering the parents' current hardships. However, the author is also balancing their own financial stability and avoiding enabling poor financial habits. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author can afford to send more, even a bit more, not doing so might be seen as selfish. But if they're also in a tight situation, it's a tough spot. The author's reasoning is pragmatic, but family expectations can be different. \n\nI think there's a middle ground here. The author isn't entirely wrong because they're making a conscious choice based on their assessment. But they might not be considering the emotional impact and the actual needs of their family. So, maybe the answer is a bit nuanced. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the family is in dire need and the author can contribute more without significant hardship, then yes, they might be at fault. But if they can't, then no. Since the author works and has a paycheck, it's possible they can contribute more. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong, but there are valid points on both sides.\n"
