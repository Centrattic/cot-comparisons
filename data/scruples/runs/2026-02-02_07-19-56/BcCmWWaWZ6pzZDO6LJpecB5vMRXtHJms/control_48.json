I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving more money to their parents. The situation is that the author's parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100. The aunt criticized the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The author explains they don't want the money wasted. They're hurt but not mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is new to the job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100, which they thought was a reasonable amount. They're concerned about their parents' financial habits. The aunt is being passive-aggressive, which adds tension. The parents have three people to feed, so maybe $100 isn't enough, but the author's reasoning is to prevent waste.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they made a choice based on their own judgment of the parents' spending habits. They didn't ignore the situation entirely; they sent money, just a smaller amount. The aunt's criticism might be unfair, especially if the parents are bad with money. The author's perspective is that they're trying to help without enabling bad habits. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents are in dire need, and the author's amount isn't sufficient. But the author's reasoning is valid. It's a balance between helping and enabling poor financial decisions. The author's response was to send what they felt was appropriate. The aunt's continued messages might be pressuring the author, but the author chose not to send more. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author isn't in the wrong because they made a conscious decision based on their understanding of their parents' tendencies. They're also new in a job, so maybe they can't afford to send more. The aunt's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't obligated to give more if they believe it will be misused. So the answer is B.\n"
