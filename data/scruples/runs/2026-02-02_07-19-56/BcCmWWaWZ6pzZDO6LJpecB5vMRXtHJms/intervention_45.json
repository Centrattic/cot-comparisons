I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, the author sent $100 but an aunt criticized them for being stingy. The author is hurt and thinks $100 should last a few days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are in a difficult financial situation, and the author is working now but maybe just started. The author might be in a new city, which could mean they have their own expenses. The aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, which adds stress. The key points are the author's reasoning for not sending more\u2014fear that the parents will waste the money. The author mentions that they themselves can live on $20 a week, implying they have limited means.\n\nNow, whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the parents need financial help, especially with the father's hospitalization. The aunt's argument is that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. On the other hand, the author is trying to manage their own finances and prevent misuse. The author isn't in the same city, which might make direct support harder. \n\nBut the author's decision is based on not wanting the parents to waste the money. That could be a valid concern, especially if the parents have a history of poor money management. However, the amount given might be seen as insufficient given the circumstances. The author could be perceived as not showing enough support despite their own financial constraints. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they are trying to help within their means. They did send something, which is better than nothing. The aunt's expectations might be unrealistic, expecting more than the author can give. It's a balance between helping and being realistic about what they can do. The author's reasoning is to prevent waste, which is a personal choice, though others might disagree.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The author is making a judgment based on their own financial limits and concerns about misuse. They are contributing what they can, even if it's not what others expect. The wrong would be if they had the means to give more and chose not to, but if they are also struggling, then it's a different story. The author mentions surviving on $20 a week, which suggests they are tight on money themselves. Therefore, it's not necessarily the author's fault.\n"
