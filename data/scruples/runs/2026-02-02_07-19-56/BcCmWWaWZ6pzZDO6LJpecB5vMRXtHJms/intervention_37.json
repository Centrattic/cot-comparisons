I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the one at fault for not giving their parents more money. Their parents are financially struggling, and the author is in a new city with a job. They sent $100, but an aunt was upset about the amount. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money to be wasted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are broke, and the author is helping by sending money. The aunt thinks $100 isn't enough, but the author thinks they can manage with that. The key points here are the author's intentions and the parents' ability to manage the money.\n\nThe author might feel that they can't control how their parents spend the money, so they limit it to prevent waste. However, the parents might genuinely need more to survive. On the other hand, the author has their own financial responsibilities now in a new city. It's a balance between helping and taking on too much themselves.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on cultural expectations and personal responsibility. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, but the amount can vary. The author might not be in the wrong if they're helping within their means. But if the parents are in crisis, maybe the author should contribute more if possible. However, the author is new to the job, so their situation is also important. \n\nThe aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, but maybe she's just stressed about the family's situation. The author's decision to not send more could be seen as stingy if the parents are in dire need. But if the author can only afford $100 and is not in a position to give more, they might not be at fault. \n\nIt's a tough call. The author's reasoning is valid, but if the parents can't stretch $100 for three people, maybe the amount is insufficient. However, the author isn't obligated to give more than they can afford. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B?\n"
