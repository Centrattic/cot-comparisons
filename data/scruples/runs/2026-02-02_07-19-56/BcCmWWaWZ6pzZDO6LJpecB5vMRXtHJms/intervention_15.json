      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author moved to a new city for a job right after the dad had a psychotic break. The parents are described as broke, and the author sent $100 through an aunt. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author's reasoning was that the parents are bad with money and might waste more, so they limited it to $100. They didn't respond to the aunt's passive-aggressive comments and aren't mad, just hurt.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, should the author be in the wrong?\n\nWell, there are a few angles here. From the author's perspective, they're new to this job, maybe just starting out, and their parents have a history of mismanaging money. The author might be trying to be responsible, thinking that giving more could lead to misuse. Also, the parent's mental health situation is a factor, with the dad recently hospitalized. The author might be stressed about moving and starting a new job, which could affect their ability to send more.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are a family of three, and $100 might not be sufficient for their needs. The aunt's argument that it's not enough to feed three people is a valid concern. The author's decision to send only $100 could be seen as not fully considering the family's immediate needs, especially if the parents are struggling financially.\n\nBut then again, the author might not have the means to send more. The post mentions the author can survive on $20 a week, which suggests they might be living frugally themselves. If the author is just starting out, their income might be limited. Also, there's the point about parents being bad with money. The author might believe that giving more would lead to waste, which is a legitimate concern if the parents have a history of financial mismanagement.\n\nAnother point is communication. The author had to go through an aunt because they couldn't reach their mom. The aunt's reaction was passive-aggressive, which could create tension. The author not responding might be because they didn't want to engage in conflict, but it could also be seen as avoiding the issue.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, there's a cultural aspect. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, especially when they're in need. However, the author might feel that they can't bear the financial burden themselves, especially if they're just starting their career. There's a balance between helping and maintaining one's own financial stability.\n\nThe emotional aspect is also important. The author feels hurt but isn't mad. The aunt's criticism might have made them feel unappreciated. The parents' situation is dire, but the author's decision is based on practical considerations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the parents are in real need and the author has the means, some might argue they should give more. However, if the author is genuinely concerned about misuse and can't afford more, they might be acting in a responsible way. The key factors are the author's capacity to give, the parents' actual needs, and the history of financial mismanagement. \n\nSince the author is new to the job, maybe their income isn't stable yet. Sending $100 might be their maximum given their own financial situation. But if the parents are in a crisis, others might expect more support. However, the author's reasoning about preventing waste is valid. So, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because they made a reasoned decision based on their circumstances. Alternatively, if there's a cultural expectation to support parents regardless, they might be seen as not fulfilling that expectation.\n\nIn the end, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The answer likely depends on the specific circumstances not mentioned, like the exact financial status of the author and the extent of the parents' needs. But given the information, the author made a choice based on their judgment of what's best, considering both their own resources and the parents' tendencies. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
