I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" so the author sent the amount to avoid them wasting it. The aunt was passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author says they're hurt and can survive on $20 a week, thinking $100 should last a few days.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the parents are in a tough spot financially, with the dad hospitalized. The author might feel a responsibility to help. But on the other hand, the parents aren't managing money well, so giving more might not be helpful. The author's reasoning is to prevent waste, but is that a valid reason?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's about balancing responsibility and practicality. If the author is in a new job and just started, maybe they have their own financial needs. Sending $100 is a gesture, but if the parents need more, maybe communication is key. However, the author didn't explain their reasoning clearly to the aunt, leading to misunderstandings. The aunt's reaction is part of the problem, but the author's refusal to send more might be seen as not considering their parents' situation fully. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they can live on $20 a week. That suggests they're not in a position to give more, which could be genuine. But if they have the means to give a bit more, even if not a lot, that might be better than the $100. However, the parents' financial mismanagement complicates things. If giving more leads to it being wasted, the author's approach is to prevent that, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and communication. The author's intention was to help but also prevent waste. However, not explaining this to the aunt and parents might have caused hurt feelings. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments are unhelpful, but the author's refusal to send more could be seen as not being supportive enough. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable given their understanding of the parents' habits. If the parents are known for mismanaging money, then $100 might be a reasonable amount to avoid enabling bad habits. But if the parents are in dire need, maybe the amount is too little. The author's explanation about surviving on $20 a week shows they might be saving, but maybe they can give a bit more. However, the key point is the parents' financial behavior. If the author has a good reason to believe more money would be wasted, then they aren't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
