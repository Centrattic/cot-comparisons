I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their parents are broke. The dad had a psychotic break, and they just moved for a job. The author sent $100 but the aunt called them stingy, arguing that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money to be wasted.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are financial responsibility and family expectations. The author is trying to avoid their parents mismanaging the money, which is understandable. They're also in a new city, possibly dealing with their own financial adjustments. The aunt's reaction might be more about the parents' financial situation than the amount itself. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are in a tough spot, and the author is contributing, even if it's a small amount. The author's decision is based on past experiences with their parents being bad with money. There's no obligation for adult children to support their parents financially, though cultural or personal expectations might influence this. \n\nThe aunt's passive-aggressive comments could be adding stress, but the author isn't ignoring them entirely. They did send money, just a smaller amount. The parents might have legitimate needs, but the author has to balance that with their own financial stability. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're setting boundaries and considering their parents' spending habits. However, there's a middle ground where communication could help. But strictly speaking, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The author's reasoning is valid, so the answer is B.\n"
