I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100. The aunt criticized the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The author explains they don't want the money wasted, and the aunt is being passive-aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They sent money despite their own financial constraints\u2014$20 a week isn't much. They're worried about the parents spending it irresponsibly. On the other hand, the parents might need more help, and the aunt is acting as a mediator here. The author's priority is to help but also ensure the money is used wisely. \n\nIs there an expectation that the author must send more regardless of the parents' habits? Or is it reasonable to set a limit to avoid waste? The parents' responsibility in managing their own finances could be a factor. Also, the author is in a new job and city, which might affect their financial stability.\n\nThe aunt's reaction seems harsh, calling them stingy and passive-aggressive. The author isn't mad but hurt. They might feel caught between helping and enabling poor financial decisions. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might argue that helping family in need is a moral duty, while others would agree that personal limits are necessary. The key points here are the author's genuine effort to help ($100 is not nothing), the parents' poor financial management, and the aunt's interference. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. They can't be responsible for their parents' financial mismanagement. It's reasonable to send a manageable amount and trust the parents to use it as they can. The aunt's criticism is probably adding stress but doesn't make the author at fault. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). They made a thoughtful decision given the circumstances and their own limitations. The parents need to handle their finances better, and the author isn't obligated to bail them out beyond their means.\n"
