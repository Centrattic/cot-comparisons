I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person sent $100 to their parents, who are struggling financially, but their aunt criticized them for not sending more. The person explains they didn't send more to prevent the money from being wasted, and they feel hurt but aren't mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are broke, and the dad had a psychotic break. The person moved for a job and sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt is upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The person argues that sending more would lead to waste due to their parents' poor money management.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility vs. family support. The person's reasoning is about preventing waste, but the aunt sees it as stinginess. The parents are in need, but the person is also in a new job and might have their own expenses. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they are trying to be responsible with the money they have, possibly not wanting to give more than necessary if they know it won't be used wisely. From the family's side, they're in a dire situation and might need more support. However, the parents' financial habits are a factor here. If they can't manage money, giving more might not help in the long run.\n\nI should also consider cultural aspects. In some cultures, supporting parents is a priority, and not doing so might be seen as neglectful. However, the author is trying to balance their own situation with helping. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might not be helpful either, but that's a different issue.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did send some money, which shows they are trying to help. The problem is the amount. The aunt argues $100 isn't enough, but the author believes $100 is sufficient if managed properly. There's a middle ground here. Maybe the author could have explained their reasoning better or offered alternative support, like helping with budgeting. But given the parents' history, maybe the author is justified in limiting the amount to prevent waste.\n\nOn the other hand, if the parents are in immediate need, $100 might not be enough. However, the author isn't in a position to give more due to their own circumstances. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more. The answer might depend on whether the author had the means to give more. If they can only afford $100, they aren't in the wrong. But if they could give more and chose not to, maybe they are. The post doesn't specify if the author has other financial obligations, but they mention that they can survive on $20 a week, which might imply they're not giving out of abundance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to help but is also being cautious. The aunt's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because they are making a responsible decision based on their knowledge of their parents' habits. However, there's room for improvement in communication and support beyond just money.\n"
