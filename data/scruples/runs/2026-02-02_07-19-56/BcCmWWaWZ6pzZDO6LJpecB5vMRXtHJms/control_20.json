I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The parents are described as terrible with money, so the person is worried they'll waste more. The person is hurt and can live on $20 a week, thinking $100 is sufficient for a few days.\n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. I need to evaluate based on the context given.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1. The parents' financial situation is dire. They're broke, and the dad had a hospitalization. The family includes a younger brother, so three people relying on the money.\n2. The author's reasoning is that the parents are bad with money, so sending more might be wasted. However, $100 might not be enough for a family of three, especially if they have urgent needs.\n3. The aunt's reaction was passive-aggressive, but the author's intention was to help without overextending themselves. The author can survive on $20 a week, so maybe they don't have much to spare.\n4. Cultural norms might play a role. In some cultures, children are expected to support their parents more generously. But the person is setting a boundary based on past experiences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author is trying to be cautious, but the amount might not be enough. However, the parents' financial mismanagement is their own issue. If the author can't afford to give more without sacrificing their own needs, maybe that's understandable. On the other hand, $100 could be insufficient for a family in crisis. But the author isn't refusing to help entirely; they are contributing what they can. The key points are the parents' behavior with money versus the children's responsibility. The author's decision isn't malicious, just protective. So, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
