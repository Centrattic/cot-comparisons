I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the author sent $100. The aunt is upset, saying it's not enough for a family of three, and called the author stingy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They moved for a job, just got their first paycheck, and couldn't contact their mom directly. They chose to send $100 through the aunt because they're worried about their parents mismanaging the money. The author isn't mad, just hurt and thinks $100 should last a few days.\n\nOn the other side, the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough. The parents have three people to feed, so maybe $100 is insufficient for their needs. However, the author's reasoning is to prevent the money from being wasted. The parents are described as terrible with money, which could mean they might spend it on non-essentials or not stretch it properly.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author's financial situation (just started a job, maybe not a high salary), their concern about misuse of funds, and the aunt's reaction. The author isn't ignoring the need but is trying to manage the situation by limiting the amount to prevent waste. \n\nI should also think about cultural context. In some cultures, there's an expectation to support parents financially, but the author is setting boundaries based on their judgment. The parents' financial irresponsibility is a valid reason to limit the amount. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be adding to the tension, but the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong if it's based on practical concerns. \n\nThe author's hurt feelings suggest they want to help but are balancing their own resources and the parents' ability to manage money. So, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the $100 is a reasonable amount given the circumstances. Since the author is being cautious to prevent waste, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
