I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is at fault for not giving their parents more money.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. Their parents are described as \"basically broke,\" and the father had a psychotic break. The author sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt then criticized the amount, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and called the author stingy.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the parents are bad with money, so they don't want to send more to prevent them from wasting it. They mention they can survive on $20 a week, implying their own financial situation might be tight. They feel hurt but not mad and are wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering different angles. On one hand, the parents are in a difficult situation with a parent hospitalized, which adds to their financial strain. The author's concern about the parents mismanaging money is a valid point, especially if there's a history of poor financial decisions. But on the other hand, not giving more might be seen as not supporting family in need, especially when the parent is unwell.\n\nThe author's justification is about preventing waste, but maybe the parents need the money for basic necessities regardless of their spending habits. The aunt's reaction suggests that the $100 might not be sufficient, and the parents have a third person (the brother) to consider. The author might be in a position where they can afford to give more, but they choose not to based on their own judgment.\n\nHowever, the key here is whether the author is obligated to give more. If the author is struggling financially themselves (as hinted by surviving on $20 a week), they might not have the means to give more. But if they can afford to give more, the decision could be seen as selfish, especially if the parents' needs are urgent.\n\nBut the author's stance is about protecting the money from being wasted, which is a personal choice. There's no legal obligation, but socially, there might be expectations. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be part of the family dynamics, but the author is standing by their decision.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong might depend on cultural expectations, the actual financial situation of the author, and the severity of the parents' needs. If the author can give more and chooses not to, some might say they're in the wrong. But if they have valid reasons (like preventing misuse of funds or their own financial constraints), others might side with them. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit.\n"
