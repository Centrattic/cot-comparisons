I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not sending their parents more money. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the author sent $100 but an aunt was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention that their parents are terrible with money, so they didn't send more to prevent waste. They also said they can survive on $20 a week, implying they're not in a financial position to give more. The aunt argued that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. \n\nThe key points here are the author's financial constraints and their intention to avoid enabling poor financial habits. The parents' situation is dire, but the author isn't in a position to help more. The aunt's passive-aggressiveness adds emotional tension, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own needs and their parents' spending habits. \n\nIt seems like the author made a judgment call based on their understanding of the parents' tendencies. Whether they're in the wrong depends on perspectives. Some might say they should help regardless, others might agree with their approach. But the author isn't at fault for setting boundaries, especially if they can't afford more and want to prevent misuse. So the answer would lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
