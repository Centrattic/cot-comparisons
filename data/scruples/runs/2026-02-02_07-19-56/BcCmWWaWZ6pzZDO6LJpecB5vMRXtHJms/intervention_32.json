I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation involves the parents being broke, the father having a psychotic break, and the author sending $100. The aunt is upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They moved to a new city for a job, just got their first paycheck, and had to manage their own finances. The author is being cautious because they know their parents are bad with money. They might be trying to help without enabling poor financial habits. The $100 could be a starting point, especially if the author is also establishing their own life and has limited funds.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt's reaction suggests that $100 isn't sufficient. The parents and younger brother's needs might be more pressing, especially with the father's hospitalization. The author's parents' financial mismanagement could be a long-term issue, but in the short term, the immediate need for more money might be valid. The author's decision to not send more might be seen as selfish or not fully considering the family's urgent situation.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's responsibility. If they have the means to help more, maybe they should. However, if they are new to the job and have their own expenses, they might not be in a position to send more. The key factors here are the author's financial situation, the parents' ability to manage money, and the immediacy of the parents' needs.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want the parents to waste the money. That could be a valid concern if past behavior shows they can't manage funds responsibly. However, the aunt's argument is that the amount isn't enough regardless. There's a balance between helping and enabling. Maybe the author should have communicated better, explaining their reasoning and perhaps setting conditions on how the money is used, rather than just sending a fixed amount.\n\nI think the answer might hinge on whether the author had the means to contribute more and whether their decision was based on legitimate financial constraints or just a personal choice to limit help. If the author is struggling, then they aren't necessarily in the wrong. But if they could afford to send more and chose not to, maybe they are. The question is whether the author's actions are considered wrong in the context of their situation.\n"
