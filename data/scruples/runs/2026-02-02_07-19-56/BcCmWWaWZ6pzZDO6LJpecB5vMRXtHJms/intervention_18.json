I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author should give their parents more money. The author says their parents are broke, and the dad had a hospitalization for a psychotic break. The author sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, and called the author stingy. The author didn't respond and didn't send more, then is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is newly in a job and got their first paycheck. They sent $100, which they might have considered a good start. However, the parents are in a difficult financial situation with a family member's health issue. The aunt's reaction suggests that $100 isn't sufficient for their needs. \n\nThe author's reasoning for not sending more is that their parents \"are terrible with money,\" so sending more might lead to wasteful spending. But the aunt argues that even $100 isn't enough to feed three people. The author feels hurt and justifies their decision, but is that reasonable?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, when family is in crisis, supporting them as much as you can is often seen as right. The author might be trying to help but is limiting the amount based on their parents' financial habits. However, if the parents are in a dire situation, maybe the author's responsibility is to provide more, regardless of how the money is used. On the other hand, if the author has their own financial constraints, they might not be obligated to give more than they can afford, especially if they believe the money would be mismanaged.\n\nBut the key here is the $100 being considered insufficient. If the author is earning enough to give more (since it's their first paycheck and they mention surviving on $20 a week, implying they have more than that), maybe they should give more. The author's justification is about the parents' wastefulness, but if the parents can't meet basic needs, that's a different issue. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might add to the tension, but the author's decision not to give more could be seen as not fully supporting their family in a crisis. \n\nHowever, the author isn't in a position where they have to give, especially if they have their own expenses in a new city. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not giving more. If they have the means to give more but choose not to due to the parents' habits, maybe they're not in the wrong because they're trying to be responsible. But if the parents are in immediate need, the author's $100 might not be enough, so the author might be in the right to be cautious. It's a tricky balance between supporting family and managing one's own resources. \n\nIn some cultures, there's a strong expectation to support parents regardless of their financial habits. In others, individuals are more autonomous. The author's perspective is that they're trying to help without enabling bad habits. The aunt's perspective is that the family is in crisis and needs more support. So, the author might not be in the wrong if they can't afford to give more, but if they can afford to give more and choose not to due to the parents' habits, it might be a gray area. \n\nGiven that the author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, their financial situation might allow for more giving, but the decision to limit the amount based on past behavior is their choice. The key is whether the $100 is truly insufficient. If the parents can't even cover basic needs with that, then maybe the author should give more. However, if the parents are mismanaging funds despite the amount, the author's decision could be justified. \n\nOverall, the answer might depend on cultural expectations and the actual financial capacity of the author. If the author has the means and the parents are in dire straits, not giving more might be seen as wrong. If the author is also struggling, it's different. But given that the author mentions their own survival on $20, they might have more to give. However, the author's reasoning is about preventing waste, which is a valid concern. So, it's a bit of both, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong if they made a conscious decision based on their assessment of the parents' habits, even if others disagree.\n"
