I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100. The aunt was upset, saying it's not enough and called the author stingy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a new job, just got their first paycheck, and sent $100. They explain they didn't send more because their parents are bad with money. The aunt is passive-aggressive, but the author isn't responding to her messages. The author feels hurt and wonders if they're at fault.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasoning and the parents' situation. The author's concern is valid if they believe the parents will waste the money. However, the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough for three people. Financial responsibility is subjective. The author is in a new job, so maybe they are still establishing their budget. But the parents are in a crisis with the father's hospitalization, which might require more urgent support.\n\nIs there a duty to help family in need? It's a cultural and personal value thing. The author might feel they can't afford more, but the parents' needs are significant. The aunt's reaction is aggressive, but the author's decision isn't malicious. The author's reasoning is about preventing waste, which is a valid concern if past experiences show that.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a choice based on their judgment. However, there's a counterargument that they should help more given the parents' situation. But since the author isn't harming anyone directly and is acting on their assessment, the answer leans towards B. They are not in the wrong.\n"
