I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The parent's situation is that they're broke, and the dad had a psychotic break. The author sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly.\n\nThe aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for three people. The author explained that they don't want the money wasted, which the aunt didn't accept. Now the aunt is trying to smooth things over, but the author feels hurt. They mention that they can survive on $20 a week and thought $100 would last a few days. \n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the key points here are the author's responsibility towards their parents, the parents' financial situation, and the author's reasoning. The parents being broke and the dad's health issue might mean they need more support. But the author is concerned about the money being wasted. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to be responsible with their own earnings and prevent misuse. On the other, the parents might be in a dire situation, and $100 might not be enough. The author's justification is valid if they've had experience with their parents mismanaging money. However, the aunt's perspective is that even a small amount isn't providing sufficient help. \n\nThe author isn't angry but hurt, which suggests they might feel conflicted. The question is whether not sending more is the right choice. The answer would depend on cultural expectations, the author's financial ability, and the parents' actual needs. If the author can afford to send more without hardship, maybe they should. But if they're being cautious due to past issues, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author's reasoning is understandable, but the aunt points out the practicality of the amount. The author might not be in the wrong if they've made a conscious decision based on their parents' tendencies. However, if the parents are in immediate need and the author has the means, some might argue they should help more. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author is making a responsible choice based on their own judgment of the parents' behavior. The aunt's criticism is her opinion, but the author isn't obligated to give more if they feel it's not wise. But maybe there's nuance. The author could consider setting up a system to ensure the money is used properly without sending large sums. Still, the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's concern about waste is valid. So B seems right.\n"
