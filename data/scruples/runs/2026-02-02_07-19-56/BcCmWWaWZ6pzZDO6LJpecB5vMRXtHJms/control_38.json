I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and called the author stingy. The author explains that they don't want the money to be wasted since their parents are bad with money. The author isn't mad but feels hurt, noting they can survive on $20 a week and thought $100 would last a few days.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The parents are broke, and the father had a psychotic break. The author is in a new job, maybe just starting their career. They sent $100 as their first contribution. The aunt is acting as a mediator here, but the author's reasoning is about preventing waste. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to support struggling family members, especially parents. However, the author is also considering their own financial situation. They mention they can live on $20 a week, which might be a stretch, but they're prioritizing not letting the money be wasted. The parents might not be managing their money well, so the author's concern is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a sick father and a young brother. The aunt's argument is that $100 isn't enough for three people. The author might be seen as not doing enough, especially if the parents are in a dire situation. But the author is also making a judgment based on past experiences with the parents' financial habits. \n\nI think this depends on cultural norms and the specific circumstances. If the author has the means to send more, maybe they should consider it, but if they're being cautious due to past issues, that's understandable too. The fact that the author is feeling hurt suggests they care but are setting boundaries. The parents' responsibility in managing their money is also a factor here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the community expects more support regardless of wastefulness, then maybe A. But if the author's approach is reasonable given the parents' history, then B. I think it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B because the author is making a rational decision based on their knowledge of the parents' behavior.\n"
