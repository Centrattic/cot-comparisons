I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for not sending more money to their parents. The scenario involves the parents being broke, the dad hospitalized, and the author sending $100. The aunt is upset, saying it's not enough. The author feels hurt but doesn't send more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" so maybe the author is concerned about them misusing additional funds. The author is in a new city for a job, so maybe their financial situation is still tight. They sent $100 as a first step, but the aunt and possibly the parents expect more.\n\nBut wait, the parents have a family of three, including a younger brother. $100 might not cover much. The aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, calling the author stingy. The author isn't mad but hurt. They mention they can survive on $20 a week, implying they have limited funds. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for not sending more.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, supporting parents is a strong norm. If the author is an adult and has the means, maybe they're expected to help more. But if they're just starting out and their own finances are tight, they might not be at fault. The key points are the parents' financial struggles, the author's concern about misuse, and the author's own financial situation.\n\nThe author explains their reasoning for not sending more, which is valid if they believe the money would be wasted. However, the problem could be in the communication. Maybe the parents or aunt felt ignored or that the amount was insulting. The author might not be in the wrong if they're acting in good faith, considering their own circumstances and the parents' tendencies. But if they have the means and are choosing not to help when it's desperately needed, that could be seen as wrong.\n\nThe aunt's role is interesting. She's acting as a mediator, but her approach is passive-aggressive. The author didn't respond to her messages, which might be part of the dynamic. The author's decision is based on their assessment of the parents' financial habits, so if that's a reasonable judgment, then they're not wrong. However, if the parents genuinely can't get by on $100, maybe they should consider other ways to help, like sending a bit more if possible or helping with budgeting.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on valid concerns about misuse and their own financial situation. They might not be in the wrong, but it's a gray area. The answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is seen as justifiable given the circumstances.\n"
