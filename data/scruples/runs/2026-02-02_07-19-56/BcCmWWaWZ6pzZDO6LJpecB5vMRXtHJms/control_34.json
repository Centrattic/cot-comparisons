I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sending their parents more money. The situation is that their parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and they sent $100 through an aunt. The aunt got upset, saying it's not enough and called them stingy. The person explains they don't want the money wasted because their parents are bad with money.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the parents' financial situation, the person's reasoning for sending less, and the aunt's reaction. The person is moving to a new city for a job, so maybe they have their own expenses now. The $100 might be a start, but the aunt argues it's not enough for a family of three. But the person is worried about the money being wasted, so they limit it. \n\nI need to consider if the person's actions are reasonable. If the parents are struggling, not helping at all could be seen as neglectful, but sending $100 might not be enough. However, the person isn't refusing to help entirely; they did send something. They also have their own financial responsibilities now. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be adding to the tension, but the person's decision is based on past experiences with their parents' money management.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, children are expected to support their parents regardless of the parents' behavior. But the person is balancing their own needs and the parents' tendencies. They might not be in the wrong if they're making a reasonable effort given their circumstances. On the other hand, if the parents are in dire need, maybe more could be done. But the person isn't refusing entirely and has a valid reason for limiting the amount. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
