My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving more money to their parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as \"basically broke.\" The author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough. The author explained they didn't send more to prevent the parents from wasting the money. The aunt then implied the $100 isn't sufficient for three people and was passive-aggressive. The author is hurt but not mad, and the question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasoning versus the aunt's reaction and the parents' situation. The author's argument is that they want to avoid their parents spending the money irresponsibly. The aunt's argument is that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author is in a new job, maybe just starting out, and might have limited income themselves. \n\nI need to consider cultural expectations, family dynamics, and financial responsibility. In many cultures, there's an expectation for adult children to support their parents, especially if the parents are in need. However, the author is concerned about the parents' financial habits. The parents being \"terrible with money\" is a key point here. If the author gives more money, it might not be used effectively, leading to the same problem. \n\nBut on the other hand, the parents are in a difficult situation with a hospitalized father. The $100 might not cover basic needs. The aunt's concern is valid in that aspect. However, the author's decision is based on their own judgment to prevent misuse. \n\nIs the author at fault? If the author had the means to give more and chose not to because they distrust their parents' spending, does that make them in the wrong? Alternatively, if the parents are mismanaging money, the author's approach could be seen as protecting their own resources. \n\nIt's a balance between supporting family and personal responsibility. The author isn't being cruel but is making a calculated decision. The aunt's reaction might be based on different priorities. The author isn't ignoring the problem but is giving what they can, considering the circumstances. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is being stingy or making a rational decision. If they can afford to give more and choose not to out of distrust, maybe they're at fault. But if they're protecting their parents from their own habits, maybe not. Given the context, the author's reasoning seems justifiable, so B (not in the wrong) might be the answer.\n"
