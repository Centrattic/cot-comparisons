I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents when the parents are struggling financially. The parents have three people to feed, and the author sent $100 but thinks the parents might waste more money if given more. The aunt is upset about the amount.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is working a new job and just started, so maybe they don't have a lot of money yet. They sent $100 as a gesture but chose not to give more to prevent misuse. However, the parents are in a tough spot, and $100 might not be enough for a family of three. The aunt's reaction is understandable because the needs are higher.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want the parents to waste money. But is this a valid reason? It's possible that the author is making assumptions about how the parents would spend the money. Maybe the parents could use the money responsibly for essentials like food and bills. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of their parents' actual needs, even if the author's intention is to avoid waste.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a new job and might have limited income. They might be balancing their own financial stability with helping their family. However, the parents are in a crisis situation, especially with the father hospitalized. The author's contribution, while a start, might be seen as insufficient given the severity of the parents' situation.\n\nThe aunt's passive-aggressive comments and the author's hurt feelings add another layer. The author might feel that they're doing their best, but the aunt's criticism is making them question their decision. The key here is whether the amount sent is reasonable. $20 a week for the author seems very low, but $100 might not stretch far for three people. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they made a conscious decision to help within their means, but they might not be considering the actual needs adequately. There's a middle ground where they could send more if possible or structure the support differently. However, the answer might depend on cultural expectations and the author's financial capacity. Given that the parents are in a crisis, the author could be seen as not providing enough support despite their reasoning. So, maybe the answer is A, but there's nuance here.\n"
