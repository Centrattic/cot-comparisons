I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Their parents are broke, and the dad had a psychotic break. The person sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The person explains they don't want the money wasted, and they're hurt but not mad.\n\nFirst, the situation: parents in financial trouble, possibly due to poor money management. The author is in a new job, just got their first paycheck. They sent $100, which the aunt criticized. The author's reasoning is to prevent waste. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to help but is cautious. They aren't ignoring their parents' needs entirely. The aunt's reaction is harsh, but the author's decision is based on their own assessment. They also mention they can live on $20 a week, implying they have some financial constraints. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. If the parents need more, maybe the author could consider sending more, but the key point is whether they're wrong for not doing so. The author's reasoning is valid\u2014they don't want the money mismanaged. However, the aunt's point is that $100 isn't enough. But the author isn't obligated to give more than they can comfortably afford. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author is helping but setting boundaries. They didn't ignore the situation entirely. The fact that they sent money at all shows they care. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. They made a judgment call based on their circumstances and the parents' tendencies. They aren't obligated to give more than they can handle, especially if they think it will be wasted.\n"
