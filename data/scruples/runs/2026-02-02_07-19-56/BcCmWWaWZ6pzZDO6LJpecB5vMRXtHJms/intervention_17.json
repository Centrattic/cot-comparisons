I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break and was hospitalized. They sent $100 through an aunt, explaining they didn't send more to prevent the parents from wasting it. The aunt got upset, said $100 isn't enough for a family of three, called the writer stingy. The writer is hurt but not mad, and they didn't send more. They\u2019re asking if they\u2019re in the wrong.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B. \n\nLet me consider the factors. The parents are described as terrible with money, so the writer's reasoning is to avoid them spending it irresponsibly. However, the need is there\u2014supporting a family of three. The writer might be in a new job and might not have a lot of money themselves. They sent $100, which the aunt thought was insufficient. \n\nOn one hand, the writer is trying to protect their money, especially if they're in a new city and need to establish their own stability. On the other hand, their parents are in crisis, and not sending more could be seen as neglectful. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. The writer's justification is based on the parents' financial habits. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be frustrating, but that doesn't mean the writer is wrong for setting a boundary. If the parents are in a real crisis, maybe the writer should consider other ways to help, like financial advice or long-term planning. However, the immediate action of not sending more might be defensible if they believe it's the best use of their money.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the writer's responsibility is to their parents, and $100 isn't enough. But if the parents are bad with money, the writer isn't responsible for their choices. The line here is tricky. The writer might not be in the wrong because they're making a choice based on their parents' behavior, but others might see it as not supporting them enough. However, the key is whether the writer is at fault. Since the parents are financially irresponsible, the writer's action is a reasonable boundary. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
