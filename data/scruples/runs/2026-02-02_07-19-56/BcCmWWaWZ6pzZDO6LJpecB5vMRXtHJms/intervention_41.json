My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the author moved to a new city for a job, the dad had a psychotic break, and the author sent $100 to their mom via an aunt. The aunt got upset, thinking it was too little. The author explains they don't want to send more because their parents are terrible with money and might waste it. The aunt is passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author isn't mad but hurt.\n\nSo, first, the author's reasoning: they sent $100 because they can only afford that, and they don't want their parents to waste more money. The aunt's argument is that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author is in a dilemma between helping their family and managing their own finances.\n\nThe key points here are the author's financial situation, their parents' inability to manage money, and the aunt's reaction. The question is whether the author is at fault for not sending more. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might feel they can't support their parents financially due to their own circumstances. However, cultural expectations might play a role here. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their parents, especially in times of need. But others might prioritize personal financial independence.\n\nThe author's choice to send $100 could be seen as a reasonable decision given their parents' history of mismanaging money. They might not want to enable further financial mismanagement. On the other hand, the aunt's concern is valid if the family is struggling to feed themselves. The author might be in a position where they can afford a bit more, but they choose not to, which could be seen as stingy or practical, depending on the perspective.\n\nThe emotional aspect is important too. The author is hurt by their aunt's comments, which could affect family dynamics. The aunt's passive-aggressive behavior might be exacerbating the situation. The author's decision not to respond further suggests they wanted to avoid conflict.\n\nConsidering all these factors, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the author can afford to give more without significant hardship and their parents are in genuine need, then not giving more could be seen as not fulfilling a familial duty. However, if the author is also struggling and the parents are likely to misuse additional funds, then the author's decision is a responsible one. \n\nIn many cases, financial responsibilities can be subjective. The author isn't legally obligated to support their parents, but socially, there might be expectations. The answer hinges on the balance between the author's financial capacity and their parents' needs, as well as the likelihood of the money being misused. Since the author chose a middle ground (sending $100) and the aunt is unsatisfied, it's a nuanced situation. However, without more context on the author's financial status beyond sending $100, it's hard to say definitively. The key is that the author made a choice based on their judgment, which might not be wrong despite the aunt's criticisms.\n"
