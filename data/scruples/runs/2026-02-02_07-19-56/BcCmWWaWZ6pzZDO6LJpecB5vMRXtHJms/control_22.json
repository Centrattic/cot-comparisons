I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, the author just got their first paycheck and sent $100. The aunt criticized the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The author is hurt but thinks $100 could last a few days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents have financial issues, so the author is concerned about them wasting the money. The author is in a new city starting a new job, so maybe they have their own expenses. The $100 might be a significant portion of their first paycheck. \n\nThe aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, calling the author stingy. But is the author actually in the wrong? Well, the author isn't obligated to give more than they can afford. The parents' financial mismanagement is an issue, so the author's reasoning to limit the amount to prevent waste is understandable. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, implying that their own expenses are low. The $100 could be a substantial amount for them to send. The aunt's criticism might be out of frustration, but the author's decision is based on practical concerns. \n\nThere's no indication that the author is being selfish without cause. They are acting in what they believe is the best interest of their family's financial stability. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
