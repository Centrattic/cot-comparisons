I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not giving their parents more money when the parents are broke. The person sent $100 but the aunt criticized them for being stingy. The author is hurt but stands by their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are in financial trouble, and the author is working now but also in a new city. They sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom. The aunt argued that it wasn't enough for a family of three. The author's reasoning is that giving more might lead to the parents wasting the money. They didn't respond to the aunt's passive-aggressive comments and aren't mad, just hurt.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial responsibility, family expectations, and communication. The author is balancing their own financial situation with their desire to help. They might be in a new job and not earning a lot yet, so $100 is a starting point. But the aunt's reaction suggests that the family expects more. The author's decision to not send more is based on preventing waste, but is that a valid reason?\n\nIn some cultures, family support is expected regardless of financial status. However, the author is also in a new job and might not have a lot of savings. The parents' financial mismanagement (terrible with money) complicates things. The aunt's passive-aggressive behavior could be exacerbating the situation.\n\nIs the author wrong for not giving more? Well, they are not obligated to support their family financially unless there's a legal or cultural expectation. However, family dynamics often involve emotional expectations beyond financial capability. The author's decision is pragmatic, but the hurt feelings indicate emotional conflict.\n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a valid reason based on the parents' financial habits. However, the situation could be handled better with open communication. The aunt's reactions are also problematic, being passive-aggressive. The author's choice reflects a balance between helping and self-preservation. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they made a reasoned decision despite the pressure.\n"
