I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not sending more money to their parents. The parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100. The aunt was upset because $100 wasn't enough for a family of three and called the author stingy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They moved to a new city for a job, got their first paycheck, and sent $100. The author's reasoning was to avoid the parents wasting the money. They also mention they can survive on $20 a week. So maybe they're in a tight situation themselves. The author isn't mad but feels hurt. They might be trying to help but also set boundaries.\n\nOn the other side, the aunt's argument is that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" which the author used as a reason to limit the amount. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments and the pressure to send more could be causing tension. The question is whether the author's decision was wrong.\n\nIs the author wrong for not sending more? Well, the parents are in dire need, but the author might have their own financial constraints. The author's reasoning is to prevent waste, which could be a valid concern if the parents have a history of mismanaging money. However, not sending any more than $100 when the family is struggling could be seen as not supporting them enough. The author's own statement about surviving on $20 a week suggests they might have limited resources, but $100 might not be sufficient either. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. If the author is concerned about the parents wasting money, maybe they could have discussed that money would be better used for specific needs rather than a lump sum. Alternatively, setting up a structured way for the parents to receive funds, like through a specific account or with guidance. \n\nThe aunt's reaction is also a factor. The author might not be at fault for not sending more, but maybe the way they handled the communication could be improved. However, the core issue is the amount. If the author is in a position to give more, not doing so when the family is in crisis could be seen as neglect. But if they truly can't afford more, then it's a different scenario. The author says they can survive on $20 a week, which is extremely low, so maybe they are in a tough spot.\n\nIn terms of cultural expectations, in some cultures, supporting aging parents is a strong norm. The author might be expected to contribute more. However, the author's own financial survival is also important. The parents being \"terrible with money\" adds complexity. The author's intention to prevent waste is understandable, but maybe they should have communicated better or found another way to assist.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, they're helping by sending some money. On the other, the amount might not be enough given the family's needs. The author's reasoning is valid (preventing waste), but the amount could be seen as inadequate. However, if the author is struggling financially themselves, it's a different story. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sending more. The answer depends on the balance between their own situation and the family's needs. Since the author is in a new job and just got their first paycheck, maybe they are still establishing their financial stability. But the parents are in a crisis, which might require more support.\n\nI think the answer is B for No, the author is not in the wrong. They made a judgment call based on their perception of the parents' behavior and their own financial situation. The aunt's criticism might be unfair, and the author isn't obligated to give more than they can comfortably provide. However, there might be better ways to handle the communication, but the core decision isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
