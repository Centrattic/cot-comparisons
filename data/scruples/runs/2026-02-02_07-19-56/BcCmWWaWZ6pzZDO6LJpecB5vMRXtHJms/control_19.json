I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is at fault for not giving their parents more money. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the person sent $100 via an aunt. The aunt was upset about the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The person explains they don't want the money wasted, and the aunt is being passive-aggressive. The person isn't mad but feels hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the obligations and responsibilities here. The parents are in a tough situation, but the child is now working and has sent some money. The key points are the parents' financial management (\"terrible with money\") and the person's reasoning to avoid them wasting it. The aunt is criticizing the amount, but the person isn't sending more. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. Some might argue that the child has a duty to support their parents, especially in need. Others might say that the child has their own financial responsibilities and can decide how much to give. The person's justification is that parents waste money, so they limit the amount. That seems practical, as giving too much might not help if it's mismanaged. \n\nHowever, the amount sent might be considered low. $100 for a family of three might not cover essential needs for long. But the person sent it via an aunt, maybe to avoid direct contact. The aunt's reaction is part of the problem. The person isn't being hostile, just standing by their decision. \n\nCultural factors might play a role here. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their parents financially. If that's the case, then not giving more could be seen as wrong. But if the culture is more individualistic, the person's choice is respected. \n\nAlso, the person's intention is important. They want to help but are trying to manage the funds responsibly. The parents' financial habits are a problem, so the person is trying to mitigate that by giving a controlled amount. \n\nOn the flip side, the parents might need more help, and the person's contribution, while thoughtful, might be insufficient. The aunt's criticism might be valid if the family's needs are more urgent. \n\nBut the person isn't being stingy out of selfishness; they have a reason. They're not in the wrong for making a judgment call based on their knowledge of their parents' situation. The aunt's passive-aggressive behavior is also part of the conflict, but that's separate from the main issue. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a choice based on their assessment of the situation. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
