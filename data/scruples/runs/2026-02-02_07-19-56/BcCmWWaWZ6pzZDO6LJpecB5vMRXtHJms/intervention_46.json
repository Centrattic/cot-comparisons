I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending their parents more money. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100. The aunt criticized them for sending too little, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author is hurt and feels they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. The author's reasoning is that the parents are bad with money, so they don't want to give more to prevent waste. The aunt argues that $100 isn't enough. But the author is new to the job and might be cautious with their own finances. Also, they're in a new city, busy, and maybe can't manage more.\n\nBut then, maybe the author has a responsibility as a child to support their parents, especially since the parents are in a crisis. However, the parents might have their own responsibilities, like budgeting. The author's concern about misuse is valid if they suspect the parents will waste the money. However, the amount $100 might be seen as insufficient by others, especially if it's for three people. The author feels hurt, which suggests they care but are conflicted.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be adding stress, but the author's decision is based on practicality. The key points are the parents' financial literacy and the author's own financial stability. If the author can afford to give more and the parents genuinely need it, maybe they should. But if the parents are likely to misuse it, then the author's choice makes sense. It's a balance between compassion and practicality.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong. They have valid reasons for not sending more. However, the amount might be perceived as stingy in the context of a family crisis. But considering the parents' history with money, the author is trying to help without enabling bad habits. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The author's intentions matter here. They did send something, even if it's less than expected. The aunt's reaction might be part of the problem too. So leaning towards B.\n"
