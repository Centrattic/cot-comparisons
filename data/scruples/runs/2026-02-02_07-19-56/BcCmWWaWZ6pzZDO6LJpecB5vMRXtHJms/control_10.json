I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they sent $100 to their parents who are broke, but an aunt criticized them for sending so little. The parents have a history of mismanaging money, so the author didn't want to give more. The aunt says $100 isn't enough for a family of three.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They just started a new job in a different city, so maybe they're still adjusting financially. They were worried about their parents wasting the money, so they limited the amount. They might be in a position where they can't afford to send more, especially if they're also trying to settle into their new city. The fact that they didn't respond to the aunt's passive-aggressive messages shows they might be trying to avoid conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt's concern is valid. $100 for a family of three might not cover basic needs for long, especially if they're already broke. The parents' financial mismanagement is a problem, but the kids might need help regardless. The author's decision to not send more could be seen as stingy if they have the means, but maybe they don't. Without knowing their exact financial situation, it's hard to say.\n\nThe author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, which is a very low amount, implying that they aren't sending money out of generosity but necessity. However, expecting someone to send more when they're barely covering their own needs might be unreasonable. The key points here are the author's intent, their financial capacity, and the parents' need versus the risk of misuse.\n\nThe author's reasoning is to prevent waste, which is a valid concern. If the parents are known for spending money irresponsibly, sending a larger amount could lead to problems. The author might be protecting their own resources while still providing some help. The aunt's criticism seems harsh if the author isn't in a position to give more. However, the emotional aspect is there\u2014the mother being upset and the author feeling hurt.\n\nIn similar situations, people often consider the balance between helping family in need and personal financial responsibility. The author isn't necessarily wrong for setting boundaries, especially if they can't afford to give more. The answer would depend on whether they have the means to give more without compromising their own needs. Since the author says they can survive on $20 a week, maybe they don't have the capacity to send more. In that case, they aren't in the wrong. The aunt's reaction might be based on misunderstanding the author's situation.\n"
