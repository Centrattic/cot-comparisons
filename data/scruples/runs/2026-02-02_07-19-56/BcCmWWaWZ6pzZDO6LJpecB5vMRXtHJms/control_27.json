      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not giving their parents more money despite their financial struggles. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 via an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The parents are in a bad financial situation with the dad hospitalized. The aunt is upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and called them stingy. The person explains they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt keeps messaging them. The person feels hurt but isn't mad.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether not sending more money is wrong. I need to consider cultural norms, personal responsibility, and the person's own circumstances. In many cultures, children are expected to support their parents, especially when parents are in need. However, the person is new to their job, maybe not in a stable position yet. They also worry about the parents mismanaging the money, which is a valid concern if the parents have a history of poor financial decisions.\n\nThe person sent $100, which the aunt argues is insufficient. The person might feel they can't afford to send more, especially if they're establishing themselves in a new city. On the other hand, the parents have three people to feed, so $100 might be a small amount. There's also the emotional aspect\u2014the person is hurt, which suggests they care but are conflicted.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation here, but morally, it's a gray area. The person is in a new job and might be cautious. However, if the parents are in crisis, some might argue the person should contribute more. The key points are the parents' desperate situation and the person's financial capacity. If the person can afford to give more without hardship, then not giving might be seen as selfish. But if the person is also struggling, it's understandable.\n\nThe aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be adding stress. The person's decision to not send more is based on practical reasons (avoiding waste), which is a valid concern. However, the amount sent might still be too low regardless of the reason. The person's own budget of $20 a week suggests they might be very frugal or in a low-income job, which complicates things.\n\nIn summary, while the person has valid reasons for not sending more, the parents' urgent need might make the person's action seem insufficient. The answer hinges on the balance between the parents' needs and the person's ability to give. Since the person is in a new job and perhaps not in a stable financial position, maybe they are not in the wrong. But if they can give more, then they might be. The question is whether the $100 is unreasonable. Given the parents' situation, it's possible others would view the amount as too low, but the person's reasoning is understandable. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they made a reasoned decision based on their circumstances.\n"
