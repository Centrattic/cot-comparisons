I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her. The parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, and the aunt got upset about the amount. The author explained they didn't want the money wasted, but the aunt thought it's not enough for a family of three. The author feels hurt and isn't angry but wonders if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is starting their first job, so maybe they have limited income. They chose to send $100, which they thought was reasonable. The parents are in a tough spot financially and had a parent hospitalized, which is a big stressor. The aunt is acting as a middleman, getting upset about the amount and being passive-aggressive.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want the money wasted. That makes sense if they know the parents have money management issues. But the aunt argues it's not enough. The family of three needing more money. But maybe the author can't afford to send more? If the author is just starting out and is used to surviving on $20 a week, maybe they can only afford $100. On the other hand, maybe the author could send more, but chose not to because they think the parents would waste it. \n\nIs the author's responsibility to their parents? Maybe they feel they should help, but if the parents are bad with money, is it their fault if the money is wasted? The author might be trying to help but in a way that prevents misuse. However, the amount might still be insufficient regardless of misuse. The aunt's reaction could be partly due to the parents' situation, not just the amount. \n\nIs the author wrong for not sending more? If they can't afford more, maybe not. But if they can afford more but choose not to due to past behavior, maybe that's a different issue. The key points are the author's financial situation, the parents' need, and the author's intent. \n\nThe author isn't angry, just hurt. The aunt might be overreacting, but the parents' needs are real. The author's decision is based on preventing waste, but maybe the parents need help regardless. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might not be in the wrong because they made a choice based on their judgment, but some might argue they should help despite the parents' habits. I think it's a no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
