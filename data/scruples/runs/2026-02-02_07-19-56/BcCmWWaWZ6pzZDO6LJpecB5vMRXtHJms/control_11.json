I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sending their parents more money. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are broke, and the dad had a hospitalization for a psychotic break. The author moved to a new city for a job and sent $100 via an aunt. The aunt was upset about the amount, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author explains they don't want the money wasted, so they sent less. The aunt was passive-aggressive, and the author is hurt but not mad.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's financial situation and their reasoning. The author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, which implies they themselves have a very tight budget. They might be in a new job and trying to manage their own expenses. The parents' financial habits are described as poor, so the author is concerned about the money being wasted. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's no obligation for a child to support parents financially unless there's a legal or cultural expectation. The author is making a personal decision based on their own circumstances. They are not ignoring their parents entirely\u2014they sent some money but chose not to send more. The aunt's reaction seems to be adding pressure, but the author isn't obligated to meet her expectations. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in times of crisis, family should support each other. But the author is in a position where they also need to take care of themselves. The parents' situation is serious, but the author's own financial constraints are a valid reason to limit contributions. The author isn't refusing help entirely but is setting a boundary based on their judgment. \n\nI think the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They made a choice that aligns with their financial reality and their assessment of their parents' habits. The aunt's criticism is unwarranted, and the author's decision is personal. So the answer should be B.\n"
