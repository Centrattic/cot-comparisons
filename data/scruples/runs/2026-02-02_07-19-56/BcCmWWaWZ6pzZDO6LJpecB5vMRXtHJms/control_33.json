I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not sending more money to their parents. The parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the person sent $100. The aunt is upset, saying it's not enough and the parents might waste more money. The author explains that they don't want the money wasted.\n\nFirst, the parents' financial situation is dire. The author is working now and sent $100, which the aunt and possibly the parents think is insufficient. The author is concerned about the parents mismanaging money. The author mentions they can live on $20 a week, which is very little, implying they're not in a position to give more. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the parents are struggling, and $100 might not be enough. On the other hand, the author is making a judgment call to not send more to prevent misuse. The author's reasoning is based on past experiences with the parents' poor financial habits. However, cutting off support entirely might not be helpful. But the author is giving some amount, just not more. \n\nThe aunt is passive-aggressive, which might indicate family dynamics where the author is being blamed. The author is hurt but stands by their decision. Legally, there's no obligation unless there's a legal responsibility, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's decision is based on self-preservation and preventing waste. If the author can't afford more, they're not in the wrong for not giving more. However, if they could give more and are choosing not to out of selfishness, that's different. The author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, which suggests they're being frugal. So, considering their own financial limits and the parents' history, the author's decision seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
