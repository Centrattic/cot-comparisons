I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. Their dad had a psychotic break, so the parents are in a tough spot financially. The author sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, and was passive-aggressive. The author didn't respond to the aunt's messages and didn't send more money. Now the author is hurt and wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that their parents aren't good with money and might waste more if given. But the aunt's point is that $100 isn't enough to sustain the family. The author is in a new job, maybe with limited income themselves. They might be trying to manage their own finances carefully. \n\nBut then, the parents are in a crisis situation with the father's hospitalization. The author's responsibility to support their family during such a time could be a factor. However, the author might not be in a position to send more money, especially if they're just starting out. \n\nIs there a cultural context here? In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, but if the parents are mismanaging money, it's a tricky situation. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt argues that $100 is insufficient. The author's action might be seen as stingy, but they might also be protecting their own resources. \n\nThe key points are the parents' current crisis, the author's financial situation, and the aunt's reaction. The author might not be in the wrong if they can't afford to send more, but there's also the consideration of family support during a difficult time. However, the author could have communicated more clearly with the aunt instead of just not responding. \n\nHmm, the author didn't explain their reasoning further, which might have helped the aunt understand. But the core issue is whether not sending more is in the wrong. If the author can't afford to send more, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they have the means and chose not to help, that's different. The story says the author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, which might imply they're not in a position to give more. So maybe they are not in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because the parents are in a tough spot. However, the author's decision is based on practicality, so maybe it's not their fault. Answer B.\n"
