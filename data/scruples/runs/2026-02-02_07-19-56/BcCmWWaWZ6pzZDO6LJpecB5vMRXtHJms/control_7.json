I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not sending more money to their parents. The parents are broke, the dad had a hospitalization, and the author sent $100. The aunt reacted negatively, saying it's not enough and called the author stingy.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they don't want the parents to waste the money. Maybe the author has seen past issues where the parents mismanaged funds. The author can only afford $100, and that's their decision. The aunt is passive-aggressive, which might be adding to the conflict.\n\nBut the parents have a third family member (younger brother), so $100 might not stretch far enough. The author is hurt and not responding to the aunt's messages. The key points are the parents' financial literacy and the author's ability to give more. If the author can't afford more, they're not necessarily in the wrong. However, if they could give more but chose not to, maybe they are. But the author says they can survive on $20 a week, implying they're not in a financial position to give more. The author's intent to prevent waste is a valid consideration.\n\nThe aunt's reaction might be partly due to her own feelings or the family's stress. The author's decision is based on their own judgment and financial constraints. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
