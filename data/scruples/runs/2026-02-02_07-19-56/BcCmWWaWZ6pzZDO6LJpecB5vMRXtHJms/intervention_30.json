I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the author moved to a new city for a job, and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't reach their mom. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author explains they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt is passive-aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They are a new worker, maybe just starting out, and they have their own expenses in a new city. They might not have a lot of money yet. They sent $100, which they thought was reasonable, but they also don't want their parents to misuse the money. The author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, so maybe they're being frugal.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are struggling. A family of three needing more than $100 to eat for a few days is a valid concern. The aunt's reaction might be out of frustration because the parents are in a difficult situation. The author's decision to not send more could be seen as stingy if others are suffering. But the author's reasoning is to prevent waste, which is understandable if the parents have a history of poor financial management.\n\nNow, considering cultural context and expectations, in some cultures, children are expected to support their parents financially. If that's the case here, the author might be seen as not fulfilling that duty. However, the author is in a new job and might not have the means yet. They also have their own responsibilities in the new city.\n\nThe key points are the parents' financial state, the author's financial situation, and the intention behind the $100. The author isn't malicious but cautious. The aunt's criticism is harsh, but the parents' needs are real. However, whether the author is in the wrong depends on societal norms and personal circumstances. Since the author is not refusing help entirely but sending some amount, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But if the parents truly can't manage money, the author's caution is valid. The answer might hinge on balancing these factors.\n"
