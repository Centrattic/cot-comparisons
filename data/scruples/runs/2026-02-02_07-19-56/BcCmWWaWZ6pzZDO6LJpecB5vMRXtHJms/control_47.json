I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author sent $100 to their parents who are broke, but their aunt criticized the amount, saying it's not enough to feed a family of three and called them stingy. The author didn't respond and didn't send more. They're feeling hurt but think $100 should last a few days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are \"terrible with money,\" so the author is concerned about them wasting more money. The author is in a new city with a job and just got their first paycheck. They might be trying to establish themselves and not have a lot of disposable income yet. $100 could be a significant portion of their paycheck, especially if they're new to the job and need to set up their own living expenses. \n\nThe aunt's reaction is important too. She's being passive-aggressive, which might be her way of expressing concern or frustration, but it's not helpful. The author's reasoning for not sending more is to prevent waste, which seems like a valid concern given the parents' financial habits. However, the aunt's point is that $100 isn't enough for three people. Depending on where they live, $100 might not go very far. For example, in a high-cost area, food and essentials could eat up that amount quickly. But maybe in their region, it's more feasible.\n\nThe author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, which could mean they're not in a position to give more. But that's their own budget; the parents' needs might be different. The question is whether the author is at fault for not giving more. If the parents are in genuine need and the author is capable of giving more, some might argue they should help. But the author is trying to protect the money from being misused. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author didn't contact their mom directly, relying on an aunt instead. That might have led to misunderstandings. The aunt's role here is a bit unclear\u2014maybe she's trying to mediate or is overstepping. The author's decision not to respond to the aunt's messages shows they're hurt but not angry, which is a key point. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to support their parents financially unless there's a legal duty (like being a minor child). However, family dynamics can make this complicated. The author's intention was to help, but their method might not have been effective. The aunt's criticism could be valid if the $100 isn't sufficient, but the author's concern about misuse is also a valid reason. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author is in a position to give more and if the amount is reasonable. If the author can afford more without sacrificing their own needs, maybe they should consider that. But if they're not able to give more due to their own financial constraints, then it's not their fault. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary to prevent misuse, but they might need to communicate better with their family to explain their reasoning and find a more sustainable way to help.\n"
