I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, the author sent $100, and the aunt is upset it's not enough. The author's reasoning is that the parents are bad with money, so they don't want to send more to prevent waste. The aunt is being passive-aggressive, calling them stingy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They moved for a job, just got their first paycheck, and sent $100. They feel $100 should last a few days. But the aunt is arguing that it's not enough for three people. The author isn't mad but hurt, comparing their own $20 a week to the parents' situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are in a tough spot with a hospitalized dad. The aunt is their relative, trying to mediate. The author's reasoning is about preventing waste, but maybe the parents need more help regardless of their habits. The aunt's concern might be valid if the parents can't manage the money properly, but maybe the author's responsibility is to help as much as they can.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, there's no legal obligation, but morally, how much should they give? The author might be right to be cautious if the parents have a history of wasting money. However, $100 for a family of three might be insufficient. The author's justification is avoiding waste, but maybe they should find a middle ground, like setting conditions on the money or giving a bit more. Alternatively, not giving any more could be seen as selfish, especially in a crisis. The aunt's reaction might be valid because the family needs more support. However, the author isn't in the wrong if they can't afford to give more. It's a balance between personal responsibility and family obligations. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a reasonable decision based on their knowledge of the parents' financial behavior and their own means.\n"
