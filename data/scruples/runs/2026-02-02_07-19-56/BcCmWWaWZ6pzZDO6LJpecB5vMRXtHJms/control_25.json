I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not sending more money to their parents despite them being broke, and the aunt being upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents are described as \"basically broke,\" and the author moved to a new city for a job. The author sent $100 initially, thinking the parents might waste more money. The aunt criticized the amount as insufficient and called the author stingy. The author is hurt and claims they can survive on $20 a week, so $100 would last the parents some time.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The parents' financial situation is dire, but the author's reasoning is that sending more might be wasted. The aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive. The author isn't mad but feels hurt. \n\nEthically, this is a tough spot. The author has their own financial responsibilities now, having just started a job. The parents might have poor money management, which could justify the author's decision to send a smaller amount to prevent misuse. However, the parents are in need, and $100 might not be sufficient for a family of three. Cultural expectations might play a role here too. In some cultures, supporting parents is a duty, but others might prioritize personal financial stability.\n\nThe author's intent is to help but without enabling bad habits. The aunt's criticism might be valid if the families have different financial realities. The author isn't refusing to help entirely but is limiting the amount. There's no indication that the author is being selfish without cause. The parents' situation is their own, possibly due to mismanagement, so the author might not be obligated to bail them out completely. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a judgment call based on their assessment of the situation. The answer is B.\n"
