I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. The situation is that the parents are broke, the author just got their first paycheck after moving to a new city for a job. They sent $100 via an aunt because they couldn't reach their mom directly. The aunt got upset, said $100 wasn't enough, and the author didn't send more, explaining they don't want the money wasted.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The parents are in a tough spot, and the author is now in a new job. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the parents to waste the money. The aunt is upset, saying $100 isn't enough. The author is hurt but not angry, and they're comparing their own budget (surviving on $20 a week) to the $100 sent.\n\nPossible angles: Financial responsibility vs. family support. The author is new to their job, maybe establishing their own financial stability. If they give more, maybe they can't manage their own needs. On the other hand, the parents have a younger brother to feed, which might require more than $100. The author's decision is based on distrust in their parents' financial habits, which is a common issue. \n\nIs $100 reasonable? It depends on the location and the parents' expenses. If they're in a place where $100 can't cover basic needs for a family of three, then the aunt's point might hold weight. However, the author can't control how the parents use the money, so maybe sending a small amount is a way to help without enabling poor money management. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is obligated to give more. If the parents are asking for help and the author can afford more, but chooses not to, is that wrong? Or is it acceptable to set boundaries? The author is in a new job, so maybe they can't give a lot yet. But the parents are in crisis. \n\nThe author's reasoning is valid if they don't trust their parents to use the money wisely. However, the aunt's argument is that $100 isn't enough. The author's stance is that they're doing their part without enabling. The question is whether the amount sent is unreasonable. \n\nIn some cultures, there's an expectation to support parents financially, especially in need. If the author is expected to provide more, then not doing so might be seen as wrong. But if the author is setting boundaries to avoid being taken advantage of, then it's justified. \n\nThe author is hurt, not angry, which suggests they feel they're being judged. They might feel they're helping by sending something but not enabling. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be adding to the tension. \n\nI think the answer hinges on cultural expectations and the specific circumstances. If the parents are in dire need and the author has the means to help more, then not giving could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the author is being cautious due to past experiences with the parents' financial habits, that's understandable. \n\nIn this case, the author sent $100, which the parents might not have enough for. If the parents are in a situation where that's insufficient, then the author could be seen as in the wrong. But if the author can't give more due to their own financial constraints, then it's not their fault. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The aunt's argument is that $100 isn't enough to feed three people. If the author can give more, and the parents are in a crisis, then the author might be in the wrong for not giving more. However, if the author is making a conscious choice to prevent misuse, maybe they're not wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author is not in the wrong because they have a valid reason for their decision, based on their assessment. So answer B (No).\n"
