I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, the author sent $100 but the aunt criticized them for it. The author explains that they don't want the parents to waste the money, and the aunt says it's not enough for a family of three.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They moved to a new city for a job, just got their first paycheck, and sent $100. They have their own financial responsibilities, like surviving on $20 a week. The author is trying to help but is worried about the parents' financial habits. The aunt is passive-aggressive, which might be adding stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are in a tough situation with a family member in the hospital. The aunt argues that $100 isn't enough. There's a cultural aspect here too; in some cultures, supporting family financially is expected more, while in others, it's more about independence. The author's reasoning is to prevent waste, but maybe the aunt is right that $100 isn't sufficient. However, the author might not have the means to give more, or they might be setting boundaries to avoid enabling poor financial decisions.\n\nThe key points are the author's financial situation, the urgency of the parents' needs, and the potential for misuse of funds. The author isn't ignoring the problem but is making a judgment call based on their understanding. The aunt's criticism could be valid, but the author's actions are based on their assessment. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they made a choice based on their own circumstances and reasoning, even if others disagree, they might not be in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
