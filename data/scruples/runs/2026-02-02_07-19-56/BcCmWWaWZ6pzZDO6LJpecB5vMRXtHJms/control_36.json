I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. So the person is asking if they're at fault for not sending more money to their parents. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the parents are in financial trouble. The dad had a psychotic break, which probably means medical bills and maybe they can't work. The person moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 through an aunt because they couldn't reach their mom directly. The aunt got upset, said $100 isn't enough for a family of three, and called them stingy. The person didn't respond, didn't send more, and now the aunt is checking in.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that their parents are bad with money, so giving more might lead to waste. They mention they can survive on $20 a week, implying their own financial situation is tight. They feel hurt but aren't angry.\n\nHmm, so is the person in the wrong? Well, from their perspective, they're trying to help but are cautious. But the aunt's reaction suggests the $100 isn't sufficient. The parents have a younger brother to take care of, so feeding three people might need more. But the person's concern about money being wasted is valid if the parents have a history of poor financial management. \n\nOn one hand, the person is being responsible with their own money and trying to avoid enabling bad habits. On the other, if the parents are in dire need, $100 might be too little. However, the person is in a new job and might not have a stable income yet. They might not be in a position to give more.\n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. If the parents are in crisis, not sending enough could be seen as neglectful. But if the person is acting in good faith, trying to help within their means while avoiding misuse, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a tough balance. The person isn't ignoring their responsibilities but is being practical. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be adding to the tension, but the person's choice is based on their assessment of the situation. \n\nI think the key factors are the parents' dire need versus the person's financial capability and their concern about misuse. Since the person is helping within their means and trying to prevent waste, they might not be in the wrong. But if the parents can't manage money, maybe the person should find another way to help, like setting up a system for the money to be used appropriately. But in this case, they chose not to send more. So maybe they're not in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
