I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not giving more money to their parents who are struggling financially.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents are \"basically broke,\" the dad had a hospital stay, and the author sent $100. The aunt criticized the amount, saying it's not enough, and the author explained they didn't want the money wasted. The author feels hurt but doesn't send more.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They want to know if that's the case. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The parents have a financial crisis. The author is working now and sent $100, which the aunt thinks is too little. The author's reasoning is that the parents might waste the money. But the parents have a young brother to support.\n\nIs the author being stingy? Well, $100 might not be sufficient. Let's consider the parents' responsibility here. The author might be in a new job and still establishing their own finances. They might not be in a position to send large amounts. However, the parents are in a dire situation with a hospitalized father and a young child. The author's reasoning is to prevent waste, but maybe they should consider the urgency of their parents' needs despite potential mismanagement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author can't control how the parents use the money. If they give more, it could be spent irresponsibly, but if they give too little, the family might not survive. It's a tough balance. The author is trying to help but setting a boundary. However, maybe $100 is truly insufficient for a family of three. The aunt's point might be valid here. \n\nIs the author at fault for not sending more? Depending on cultural norms and the actual financial situation of the author. If the author is just starting out, maybe they can't afford to send more. But if they can afford to send more than $100, perhaps they should reconsider. The key is whether the author had the means to give more and chose not to out of selfishness. The author says they can survive on $20 a week, which suggests that they might have more to give. If that's the case, then not giving more could be seen as not supporting the family in their time of need.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is to prevent waste. However, withholding help might be seen as selfish. In many cultures, helping family in need is expected, even if you have to be careful how they use it. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not contributing more when they can. The answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the author can't afford more, then B. The question is whether the author is at fault regardless of their ability to give more. \n\nGiven that the author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, they might be saving a lot. So perhaps they could send more than $100. If they chose not to, that might be seen as the wrong choice. Hence, A.\n"
