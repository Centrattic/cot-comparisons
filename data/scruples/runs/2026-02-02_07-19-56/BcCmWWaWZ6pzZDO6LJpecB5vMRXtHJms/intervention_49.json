I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe author just moved to a new city for a job and got their first paycheck. Their dad had a psychotic break, which probably added stress. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three and accused the author of being stingy. The author didn't respond but didn't send more money. The aunt kept messaging, and the author feels hurt but not mad.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The parents are in a tough financial situation, which is clear. The author might be trying to help but is cautious about their parents' financial habits. They mention the parents are \"terrible with money,\" so they don't want to send more in case it's wasted. But the aunt sees this as insufficient. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, giving money is a personal choice. The author might be managing their own finances carefully, especially since they just started a job. The amount they gave is their decision unless there's a prior agreement. However, the parents' need is significant\u2014supporting a family of three. If $100 isn't enough, that's a problem. But the author's reasoning is that they don't want the money misused. \n\nThe aunt's passive-aggressive comments add tension, but the author isn't obligated to give more just because the aunt is upset. However, maybe the author should consider alternative ways to help without sending cash, like helping with budgeting or finding resources. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for not giving more. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They aren't required to give more than they're comfortable with, especially if they fear misuse. The parents might need more support, but the author's choice to send $100 is their right. The aunt's reaction is separate from the author's responsibility. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
