I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me think about this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not giving their parents more money. The situation is that the parents are broke, the author just got their first paycheck, sent $100 to the mom through an aunt, and the aunt criticized the amount. The author explains they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt thinks $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author feels hurt but isn't mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are in a difficult financial situation. The author is newly employed and might be establishing their own financial independence. They sent $100, which they might consider a start. The aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, calling the author stingy. The author's reasoning is to prevent the parents from wasting the money, which suggests they have a history of financial mismanagement.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, giving money to family in need is a personal decision. The author is balancing their own financial stability with family obligations. They might not have enough to give more, or they might prioritize saving or setting their own life. The amount sent could be seen as insufficient by some, but others might argue it's a start. However, the author's explanation about preventing waste is a valid point. They might not have the means to give more, especially if they're starting a new job. The aunt's criticism could be adding stress, but the author's choice not to send more isn't necessarily wrong given their reasoning. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I should also consider cultural expectations, which can vary. In some cultures, supporting aging parents is expected more, but the situation involves a younger brother too. The author might be in a tough spot. I think the key is that the author isn't obligated to give more than they can afford, even if others criticize the amount. So, B.\n"
