I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break, and their parents are broke. The author sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The aunt got upset, said $100 isn't enough for a family of three, and called the author stingy. The author didn't respond to her messages and didn't send more money. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author's position is that they sent $100, which they think is reasonable given their parents' financial habits. They mention that they can survive on $20 a week, implying they might not have much to spare. The parents are described as \"terrible with money,\" so the author is trying to prevent waste. However, the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough for three people, which might be a valid concern if the parents are in a dire situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a new job and might be adjusting their own finances. They might have limited resources. The author didn't send more, possibly because they fear misuse, but maybe they could have communicated better. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be part of the problem, but the author's refusal to send more could be seen as not fully supporting their family in need. However, the author isn't obligated to give more than they can afford, especially if they believe the money would be wasted. The key point is whether the amount given is reasonable under the circumstances. If the author genuinely can't afford more, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if there's a perception that they could give more and aren't, that might be where the conflict lies. So, considering all factors, it's a bit of a gray area, but the author's decision to limit the amount due to financial habits might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
