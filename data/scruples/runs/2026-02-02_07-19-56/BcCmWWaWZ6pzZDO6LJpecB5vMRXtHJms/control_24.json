      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the person just got their first paycheck after moving to a new city for a job. Their dad had a psychotic break and the parents are \"basically broke.\" The person sent $100 via an aunt because they couldn't reach their mom directly. The aunt then criticized the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three and called them stingy. The person didn't respond to the aunt's messages and isn't mad but feels hurt. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not sending more.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The parents are in a bad financial situation. The person is new to their job, possibly on a limited income themselves, and chose $100 as a way to help. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments might be adding stress. The person's reasoning is that they don't want the money wasted. But the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong. On one hand, they might be in a position where they can't afford to give more, especially if they're just starting their job. They might have valid concerns about the parents' financial habits. On the other hand, the parents are struggling, and $100 might indeed be insufficient. However, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about moral responsibility, not just financial feasibility.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to help entirely; they're giving what they can. The aunt's reaction is more about the amount being too small. The author's reasoning is pragmatic. But maybe there's an expectation in the family to give more when the parents are in crisis. However, the author isn't neglecting them entirely. They did send money. If the author can't afford more, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if there's a cultural or family norm expecting more, perhaps they are. The author also mentions they can survive on $20 a week, which might suggest they're in a better financial position than they're letting on. Wait, but that might be their personal spending, not their total income. If they're earning enough to cover their own needs and have some left over, giving more could be feasible. However, the parents' financial mismanagement is a factor. The author might be trying to protect the money from being misused. \n\nIn many cases, financial help given with the intention to help, even if the amount is less than expected, isn't necessarily wrong. The parents' situation is dire, but the author isn't refusing help. The aunt's reaction is harsh, maybe expecting more, but the author isn't obligated to give more than they can afford. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong, hence answer B.\n"
