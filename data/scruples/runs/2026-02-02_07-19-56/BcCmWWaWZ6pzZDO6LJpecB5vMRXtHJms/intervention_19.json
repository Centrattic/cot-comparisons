I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author moved to a new city for a job and their dad had a psychotic break. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't reach her directly. The aunt was upset, saying $100 is too little for a family of three. The author explained they didn't want the money wasted, but the aunt was passive-aggressive. The author didn't send more and now is being asked if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that they don't want the money wasted because their parents are terrible with money. But the aunt argues that $100 is insufficient for a family's needs. The author is hurt because they can survive on $20 a week, so they think $100 should be okay for a few days. But maybe $20 a week is for themselves, and their parents' situation is different. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms, family expectations, and the actual financial situation. If the parents are broke and have a young brother, $100 might not last long. Maybe the author's reasoning is practical, but family might see it as not enough. However, the author has their own responsibilities in a new city. They just got their first paycheck, so maybe they're not in a position to send more. \n\nThe aunt's reaction is passive-aggressive, which complicates things. The author might be in a tough spot between supporting their parents and managing their own finances. But is it wrong to set a boundary? If the parents can't manage money, maybe the author is right to not send more. But the emotional aspect is there\u2014family might feel they're not helping enough. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. They made a decision based on their knowledge of their parents' habits and their own new job situation. The aunt's criticism might be harsh, but the author isn't obligated to give more if they can't afford to. However, maybe the amount is too low regardless. It's a balance between practicality and emotional family expectations. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think they're not. So the answer would be B.\n"
