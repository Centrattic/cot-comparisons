She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 to their mom through an aunt because they couldn't contact her directly. The aunt was upset about the amount, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, especially since the parents are broke and the dad had a psychotic break. The author explained they didn't send more to prevent the money from being wasted, but the aunt was passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The author isn't mad but feels hurt, thinking $100 could last a few days, while they themselves could survive on $20 a week.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more. Let's break it down. Financial responsibility is a big factor here. The parents are struggling financially and the dad is unwell. The author is in a new job, maybe just starting out, so their income and expenses might be tight too. The author's reasoning is that the parents waste money, so giving more would be unwise. However, the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. \n\nI should consider cultural expectations. In some cultures, supporting parents financially is expected, especially when they're in need. But the author is trying to protect the money from being mismanaged. However, maybe the parents genuinely need more than $100 to cover essentials. The author might be in a position where they can afford a bit more, given that they can survive on $20 a week. Wait, the author says they can survive on $20 a week, implying that they can spare more than $100. If that's the case, maybe they could give a bit more to help the family without being taken advantage of. But maybe the author's income isn't that high, or their expenses are higher. The post doesn't specify their income level. \n\nAnother angle: the parents' financial literacy. If they are terrible with money, maybe the author is right to be cautious. But in a crisis, like a parent's hospitalization, maybe immediate needs are more important than long-term management. The author might feel that giving a larger amount would just lead to the money being spent on non-essentials, but the parents might need help with basic necessities. \n\nAlso, the author's intention to support their parents is there\u2014they did send $100. The issue is the amount. If $100 is not enough for a family of three, especially in a time of crisis, then maybe the author is not doing enough. The aunt's reaction might be valid, but the author's decision is based on their assessment of the situation. However, the author might not fully understand the parents' current expenses or the cost of living in their area. \n\nIs it fair for the author to decide the amount based on their own spending habits? The author can survive on $20 a week, but that's their own standard of living. The parents might have different needs, like medical bills, groceries, etc. So maybe the author is underestimating the necessary amount. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to avoid enabling poor financial habits. If the parents have a history of mismanaging money, the author might be right to be cautious. But in an emergency, such as a parent's hospitalization, the priority might be immediate support rather than long-term financial planning. \n\nI think the key points are: the author's financial capability, the parents' actual needs versus the author's perception, and cultural or familial expectations. The author might be in a tight situation themselves but could consider a middle ground. However, not sending more might be seen as not doing enough, especially if the money is genuinely insufficient for a family's needs. So, depending on the circumstances, the author might be in the wrong if their income allows for more support. But if their income is very low, they might not be in the wrong. The post says the author can survive on $20 a week, which suggests they might be able to give more without needing to spend all the money on themselves. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong for not sending more, as their own financial situation allows for some contribution beyond $100. But I need to make sure I'm not assuming their income is high just because they can survive on $20 a week. Maybe they have other expenses or the $20 is their entire budget. The post is a bit ambiguous on that. \n\nConsidering all factors, I think the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They are making a judgment based on their knowledge of their parents' tendencies. However, the amount might be too low given the parents' situation. But without knowing the author's financial capacity, it's hard to say. Since the author mentions they can survive on $20 a week, implying they can afford more, maybe they should have sent a bit more. But if they can't afford more, then they're not in the wrong. The answer depends on their financial capability, which isn't fully detailed. Given that they just got their first paycheck, they might be setting aside some funds carefully. However, if they can afford to give more, then maybe they are in the wrong. Given the ambiguity, but leaning towards the author's intention to help while being cautious, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the parents' needs might not be met with $100. Alternatively, if the author can only afford $100, then it's their decision. The key is whether the author is being stingy or making a reasonable choice. The post says the author is not mad but hurt, feeling they did something right. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
