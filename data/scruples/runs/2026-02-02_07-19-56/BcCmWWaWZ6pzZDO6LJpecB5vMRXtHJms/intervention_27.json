I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The parents are broke, the dad had a psychotic break, the author sent $100, an aunt got upset, and now the author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is working in a new city, just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 because they couldn't reach their mom. The aunt is upset, saying it's not enough for three people. The author is worried about their parents wasting the money.\n\nThe key issues here are financial responsibility and family dynamics. The author's reasoning is that they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough. The author is also feeling hurt and not angry, just not sending more.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, family support is important, especially when parents are struggling. However, the author's concern about misuse is valid. But is $100 enough? Maybe not. The aunt's passive-aggressive comments and the author's decision not to send more might be seen as withholding help when needed, even if there's a reason for it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a new job, maybe just starting out, and might have their own expenses. They might not have a lot of disposable income yet. But the parents have a mentally ill parent and a young brother, which increases their need.\n\nI think the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they did send some help, even if it's less than the aunt wanted. But maybe they could have considered another approach, like discussing with the parents or setting up a structured way to send money. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they chose to send a small amount and the parents are in dire need, some might argue they should have given more regardless of the risk of misuse. But others might agree with the author's caution.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they did send some money and had a reason to be cautious. But the aunt's reaction is also a factor. The author could have explained more or found a middle ground. But the question is about being in the wrong. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong, because they made a choice based on their judgment, even if others disagree.\n"
