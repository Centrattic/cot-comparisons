I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending more money to their parents. The situation is that the author moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break, and they sent $100 through an aunt. The aunt criticized the amount, saying it's not enough for a family of three. The author explains they don't want the money wasted because their parents are bad with money.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The parents are broke, which adds to the pressure. The author's reasoning is based on preventing waste. But the aunt is upset, suggesting the amount is insufficient. The author isn't angry but feels hurt.\n\nI should consider factors like financial responsibility, family obligations, and the parents' ability to manage money. The author's decision might be seen as practical, but the aunt's reaction indicates the money might not cover basic needs. However, the author is in a new job and might be establishing their own finances. There's a balance between helping parents and managing personal finances.\n\nThe key points are the parents' financial instability, the author's concern about misuse, and the aunt's argument about the amount being insufficient. The author might be right in wanting to avoid waste, but if $100 isn't enough for essentials, that's a problem. However, the author isn't obligated to provide for their parents, especially if they have their own financial constraints. It's a tough spot, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to manage their resources while still sending some help. The answer might be B, but I need to check if there's a cultural expectation here. In some cultures, supporting parents is expected, but the author's reasoning is about preventing waste. So maybe B (not in the wrong) because they made a judgment call based on the situation.\n"
