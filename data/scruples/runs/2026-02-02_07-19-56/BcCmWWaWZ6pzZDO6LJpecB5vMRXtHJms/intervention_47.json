      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about not giving more money to parents who are struggling financially. The person moved to a new city for a job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100 via an aunt because they couldn't contact their mom directly. The aunt got upset, saying $100 isn't enough for a family of three, especially with the dad's hospitalization. The person explains they don't want the money wasted, but the aunt is passive-aggressive, calling them stingy. The person isn't mad but feels hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are broke, and the dad had a psychotic break. The person is new in a job, so maybe they're not in a position to give more. But the aunt is acting as the middleman, which might not be the best approach. The person's reasoning is to avoid the money being wasted, but maybe the aunt is trying to represent the parents' needs.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, maybe there's a cultural expectation of supporting parents financially, especially when they're in crisis. But on the other hand, the author is trying to be responsible with their own money. The aunt's reaction might be part of the problem here. If the author had communicated directly with their parents, maybe there could have been a better understanding. However, the author's decision to not send more could be seen as callous if they have the means to help more. But if they can't afford to give more, that's different. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not giving more, not necessarily if they should have. \n\nCultural factors matter. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their parents, and not doing so might be seen as wrong. In others, individual responsibility is more emphasized. The author's decision is based on practicality (not wanting money wasted), but maybe they should have tried to discuss it with their parents instead of relying on an aunt who's passive-aggressive. The fact that the author is hurt suggests they care, but their actions might be seen as insufficient. However, if they can only afford $100, maybe that's all they can do. But if $100 isn't enough for the family's needs, then maybe they are in the wrong. It's a bit of a judgment call. \n\nAnother angle: the author is new to the job and might not have a lot of savings. The initial $100 might be their way of helping while ensuring it's used. However, if the family of three can't survive on that, then the author's approach might be insufficient. The aunt's messages might be pushing for more, but the author's reasoning is valid. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to be responsible. Alternatively, maybe they should have given more if they could. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author can afford more. If they can and choose not to, maybe they're in the wrong. If they can't, then not. The post says they can survive on $20 a week, implying they're giving more than $100. Wait, wait\u2014the person says \"I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days.\" That's confusing. If they can live on $20 a week, maybe they can afford more than $100. But maybe $20 a week is their own budget, so the $100 is a significant portion. The problem is that $100 might not be enough for the parents. The author's reasoning is to prevent waste, but maybe they should trust their parents to use it appropriately. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on their ability to give more and the cultural context. If they can give more and choose not to, maybe AITA. But if they're being reasonable with their own resources, then not. The author's explanation is that they don't want the money wasted, which is a valid concern. The aunt's reaction might be part of the issue. So, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
