I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. \n\nI just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. \n\nMy aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving their parents more money. Let's see... \n\nFirst, the context: The author moved to a new city for a job, their dad had a psychotic break, and they sent $100 via an aunt. The aunt got upset, saying it's not enough, and the author didn't send more because they think their parents waste money. The parents are described as \"terrible with money.\"\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's responsibility, the parents' financial situation, and the aunt's reaction. The author is in a new job and just got their first paycheck. They sent $100, maybe as a gesture, but the aunt is upset. The author's reasoning is that sending more might be wasted. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. From the information given, the author is making a conscious decision based on their perception that their parents can't manage money. But the aunt argues that $100 isn't enough for a family of three. The author isn't angry but hurt. \n\nNow, considering cultural and family dynamics. In many cultures, there's an expectation to support parents, especially in times of crisis. However, the author is balancing their own financial stability with helping. The author might not have the means to send more, but the aunt is criticizing the amount. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they made a choice based on their judgment. The parents are in a bad situation, but the author might be protecting their own resources. The aunt's passive-aggressive behavior adds stress. The author isn't refusing all help but is giving what they can. \n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to manage their own finances while helping, even if it's a smaller amount. The parents' issues are their own, and the author can't be responsible for how they spend the money. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
