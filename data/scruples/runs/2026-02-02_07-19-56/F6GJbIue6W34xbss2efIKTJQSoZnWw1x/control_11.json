I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school on Valentine's Day. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parent doesn't go to church anymore, while the husband does. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and want to distribute them. The parent finds it cringy and doesn't want them to hand them out, so they hid the bracelets. The husband is upset but let it go. Now, the parent is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is about the parent's decision. Let's break down the key points. The school is public, and the kids are being asked to distribute religious items. From a U.S. perspective, there are laws about separation of church and state in public schools. Schools can't promote religion, but students can express their beliefs as long as it's not disruptive. However, if the school is encouraging the kids to distribute these bracelets, there might be legal issues. The school might be violating policies by promoting religious expression as part of an activity like Valentine's Day.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is making a personal choice based on their discomfort. They might be concerned about their kids being embarrassed or the school's potential policy. The husband is upset because he sees this as opposing his religious practice, but the parent is respecting their own beliefs and the school's boundaries.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Well, they have the right to make decisions based on their beliefs and what they think is best for their kids. The school's involvement in distributing religious items could be problematic, so the parent's action to stop it might be justified. The husband's reaction is more about his own beliefs conflicting, but the parent isn't obligated to support that. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
