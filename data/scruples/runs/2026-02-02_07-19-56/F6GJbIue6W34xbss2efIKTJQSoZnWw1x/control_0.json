I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day.\n\nFirst, the context: The mom isn't religious anymore, while the dad is. The kids get the bracelets from church and want to give them out at school. The mom is uncomfortable with it, thinks it's cringey, and doesn't want the kids to do it. The husband is okay with it but a bit miffed. The school is public, so maybe there are rules about religious materials?\n\nI need to consider a few things. The parent's rights versus the school's policies. In the US, there's the First Amendment which protects free exercise of religion but also the separation of church and state in public schools. However, students can express their own religious beliefs as long as it's not disruptive. But when it's part of a school event like Valentine's Day, the school might have rules against proselytizing. \n\nThe bracelets have a Bible verse and a church website. If the school has a policy against distributing religious materials in the classroom, especially during school events, the mom might be right to stop it. But if the school allows personal expression, then maybe the dad's side is okay. However, the mom is concerned about her kids being embarrassed and the potential for the school to have issues with it. \n\nAlso, the parents have different beliefs. The mom's decision could be seen as her not supporting her husband's religious practices. But since she's the one making the final call, maybe she's within her rights as a parent to make that choice. The kids are young, so both parents' beliefs are influencing their views. \n\nAnother angle: The school might have guidelines. If the bracelets are considered religious proselytizing during school activities, the school might not allow it. So the mom is protecting her kids from possible backlash or school disciplinary action. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the kids should be allowed to share their faith, especially if it's something they learned at church. But the mom is the one who isn't religious and doesn't want her kids to be embarrassed. \n\nSo, considering all that, it's a matter of parental rights versus school policies and the parents' differing beliefs. The mom's decision to stop the bracelets might be justified if she's concerned about the school's reaction or her kids' feelings. The husband might be upset because he feels it's part of their religious practice, but the mom has the right as a parent to make that choice. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
