I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school. The kids got them from church, and the author is an atheist now, while the husband is a believer. There's some marital tension from that.\n\nFirst, parental rights. Parents have the right to raise their kids as they see fit, including religious upbringing. But when it comes to school, there are rules about proselytizing. Public schools often have policies against promoting specific religions to maintain neutrality. So the author might be right in avoiding that.\n\nThen, the kids' autonomy. They're 6 and 8, so they might not fully understand the implications. But they were told they can choose to hand them out. The author is worried about embarrassment and the school's stance. If the school allows Valentine's Day activities, maybe they can't restrict religious items unless it's part of a policy against it. If the school doesn't allow any religious content, then the author is right. But if they do, maybe the author is overstepping by not letting the kids participate.\n\nAlso, the husband is upset. The author's decision affects both parents' roles in the kids' lives. The husband might feel his religious values are being ignored. But the author has the right to her beliefs as well. It's a conflict between two parents' beliefs. The question is whether the author's action infringes on the kids' ability to express their family's beliefs, but since the kids are young, they might not have a strong stance yet.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, the establishment clause prohibits schools from promoting religion, but students can express their beliefs unless it's disruptive. So if the school allows the bracelets, the author shouldn't restrict them. But if the school doesn't, the author is right. However, the user's scenario doesn't mention school policy, so maybe the default is to assume the school allows it unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlso, the author's reason is embarrassment. That's a personal feeling. Should parents prevent kids from activities that might embarrass them? It's subjective. But if the school allows it, the author's choice is more about her discomfort than the kids' well-being. However, she's acting as the parent, so her decision is valid unless it's harmful.\n\nIn terms of the AITA aspect, it's about whose side to take. The author is not in the wrong if the school allows it and she's making a choice based on her beliefs. But if the school has a policy against proselytizing, then she's right to stop the bracelets. Since the scenario doesn't specify school policy, maybe the answer leans on the author not being in the wrong because she's exercising her parenting choice in a public school context where neutrality is important.\n"
