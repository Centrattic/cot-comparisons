I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting their kids to pass out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author doesn't attend church and has no faith, so they're uncomfortable with the religious aspect. Their husband does go to church, and the kids are involved. The bracelets have a Bible verse and info about the church. The author put them away, not wanting the kids to distribute them, which upset the husband a bit.\n\nNow, considering the kids' school context: it's public, and handing out religious materials could be seen as proselytizing in a public school setting. There might be rules against that. The author is worried about embarrassment and appropriateness. On the other hand, the husband supports the church activities, so there's a marital tension here too.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to object to religious activities in their children's education and the school's policies. If the school doesn't allow religious materials, the author is right to stop it. But if the school allows it, maybe the author is overstepping. However, the author has the right to make decisions about their children's religious exposure, especially if they're not religious. The husband's reaction is about the children's religious involvement, but the author's stance is about their personal beliefs and values.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're respecting their own beliefs and possibly the school's secular environment. The husband might feel his religious expression is being suppressed, but the author has the final say in their children's upbringing. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
