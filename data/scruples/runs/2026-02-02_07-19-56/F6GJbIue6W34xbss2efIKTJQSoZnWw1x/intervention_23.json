I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets for Valentine's Day at school. The parent doesn't go to church anymore, while the husband does. The kids got the bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to hand them out. The parent put them away, feeling it's inappropriate and cringey, and the husband is upset but let it go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The parent's perspective is that they don't want their kids to distribute religious material at school, possibly due to personal beliefs and concerns about embarrassment or separation of church and state. The husband's side is about honoring the church's request and supporting the kids' involvement.\n\nIn the US, schools generally allow students to express their religious views, but the school can't promote or endorse a particular religion. If the kids are handing out the bracelets on their own, that's allowed under the First Amendment. However, if the school is involved in distributing them, that could be different. But here, the school is public, and the kids are doing it themselves. So from a legal standpoint, the kids can distribute the bracelets if they choose.\n\nBut the parent's objection is about personal discomfort and not wanting the kids to do it. Parents have the right to make decisions for their children, so if they think the activity is inappropriate, they can prevent it. However, the husband feels it's important for the kids to participate, which could relate to their religious beliefs. The tension here is between the parents' differing beliefs.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The parent's right to make decisions for their child, 2) the child's right to express their beliefs if old enough, 3) school policies regarding religious expression. Since the kids are 6 and 8, they may not be fully aware of the implications. The parent is acting on their own beliefs and concerns. The husband's miffed reaction shows the conflict between parental rights and religious expression.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that decision. They are prioritizing their child's comfort and their own beliefs. However, the husband might feel the parent is undermining the church's activity. But since the parent isn't forcing the kids to do it, just preventing them, it's within their rights. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
