I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school on Valentine's Day. The author's husband goes to church, they don't. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and the teacher wants them to give them out. The author is uncomfortable with it, finds it cringy and embarrassing, so they hid the bracelets. The husband is upset but let it go for now. Now, the author is worried about being the \"asshole\" if they don't let the kids take them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, schools have rules about religious activities. The Equal Access Act allows student groups to meet if the school permits other clubs. If the church group is a recognized club, they might be allowed to distribute items, but there could be restrictions. However, the school is public, so there's a need to avoid endorsing any religion. If the bracelets are seen as proselytizing, the school might not allow it. But the teacher's request is part of a church activity, not the school's official event.\n\nThen, the parents' right to raise their children as they see fit. The author doesn't want their kids to distribute religious materials, possibly due to personal beliefs or the school's secular environment. The husband's approach allows the kids to choose, but the author didn't let them take the bracelets without checking if the school allows it. \n\nThe key points: The school's policy on religious items. If the school permits it, the author is overstepping. If not, then the author is protecting the kids. Also, the children's autonomy. The husband said they can hand them out if they want. The author didn't consult the kids or the school first. \n\nPublic schools often have strict policies to prevent religious activities from being forced on students. Distributing religious bracelets could be seen as coercive or inappropriate. The author might be right in preventing this to avoid potential problems at school. However, the husband's perspective is that the kids should have the choice. The author's decision could be seen as denying that choice. \n\nBut the author's discomfort is valid. They might not want their children to be involved in promoting a religion the author isn't part of. Also, if the school doesn't allow religious items, the author is protecting the kids from possible disciplinary action. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the school allows such distribution. If the school does, and the author's decision was based on their own preferences without considering the kids' choice, then maybe. But if the school doesn't, then the author is protecting the kids. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's reasoning is about appropriateness and embarrassment, not religious freedom per se, but in a public school setting where religious proselytizing can be an issue, the author's action might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
