I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school. The situation involves a religious difference between the parents. The husband goes to church, the author doesn't. The kids got bracelets from church to distribute for Valentine's Day. The author thinks it's cringy and doesn't want them to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights. In the US, parents have the right to raise their children according to their religious beliefs, but there's also the aspect of a child's welfare and the parent's own beliefs. The author isn't against the religious aspect per se, but she finds it cringy and embarrassing. She's acting on her own discomfort rather than the kids' best interest in this case.\n\nThe school's policy matters. Public schools in the US have rules about proselytizing to prevent religious endorsement. If the kids are handing out religious items, that might violate school policies. The author might be protecting the kids from potential issues at school. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that he wants to support the church's activities, but the author is making the decision. There's tension here, but the main question is about right and wrong. \n\nThe parents have joint responsibility, but since the author isn't the one taking the kids to church, maybe she's not in the wrong for objecting. The key is whether her action is harmful. If she's not forcing the kids to do it, and she's acting on her own discomfort, maybe she's not wrong. But if the kids are being denied something the other parent supports, there's a conflict. However, the school's rules might back her up. \n\nAlso, the kids are young, so the parents should consider their well-being. If the school disapproves, the kids might face backlash. The author is protecting them from that. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Her decision is based on her own beliefs and the potential school rules. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
