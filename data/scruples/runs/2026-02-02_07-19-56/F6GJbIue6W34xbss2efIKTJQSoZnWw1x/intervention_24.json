I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's husband takes their kids to church on Sundays, and the kids come home with Bible verse bracelets for Valentine's Day. The author doesn't go to church anymore and finds it cringey to hand out religious items at school. She put the bracelets away and didn't let the kids take them. The husband is upset but dropped it, and now the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. In many places, schools have policies about proselytizing or distributing religious materials during school events like Valentine's Day. If the school allows such activities, then maybe the kids can do it. But if the school is against it, distributing bracelets might be a problem. The author might be right in not wanting to risk any issues with the school.\n\nThen there's the aspect of parental rights. Both parents have the right to make decisions for their children. The husband supports the kids giving out the bracelets as part of their Sunday school activity, while the author is against it. Since both parents have equal say (assuming joint custody or shared responsibility), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for disagreeing. But maybe the husband's clarification that the kids could choose to give them out or not is important. The author might be imposing her views by not allowing them to take the bracelets, even if the kids wanted to participate.\n\nEthically, the author might be concerned about the kids being embarrassed if their classmates aren't religious. Public schools often have secular policies, so handing out religious items might not be appropriate. On the other hand, the kids might see it as a fun activity and the author is limiting their choices based on her own discomfort.\n\nThe marital tension is also a factor. The husband is miffed, which suggests that the author's decision affects their relationship. However, the author's decision is based on her personal beliefs and her child's well-being in a public setting.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's decision could be seen as protecting her children from potential embarrassment or adhering to school policies. But it could also be seen as not respecting the husband's and the kids' wishes. The answer might depend on whether the school allows such activities. If it's allowed, the author might be limiting the kids' participation in a family activity. If not allowed, she's doing the right thing. Since the school is public, it's likely that distributing religious items isn't permitted, so the author's action is justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
