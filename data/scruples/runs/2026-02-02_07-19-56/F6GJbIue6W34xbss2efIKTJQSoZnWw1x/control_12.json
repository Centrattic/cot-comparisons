I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. Let's see the details.\n\nSo the parents are in a situation where the husband takes the kids to church, but the wife doesn't go anymore. The kids come home with these bracelets from Sunday school, meant to hand out on Valentine's Day. The wife thinks it's cringy and embarrassing, so she hides them. The husband is upset but let it go. The question is whether the wife is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school is public, and the kids are being asked to distribute religious items. Public schools in the US have guidelines about religious activities to avoid promoting religion, even if it's from students. So if the kids hand out these bracelets, it might violate those policies. The wife might be right to prevent that, to avoid potential issues with the school or legal concerns about separation of church and state.\n\nAlso, the kids are young (6 and 8), and the parents have different religious views. The wife is concerned about her kids being embarrassed or feeling pressured. Since she doesn't practice the religion, she might not want her children to be associated with it in a public school setting. The husband supports the church, but the wife's decision could be about protecting the kids from possible backlash or embarrassment.\n\nAnother angle is parental rights. Both parents have a say in their children's upbringing. The husband went along with the church activities, but the wife is now objecting. However, the school's policies might take precedence here. If distributing religious items is against the school rules, the wife is acting in the kids' best interest by following those rules.\n\nBut then, the husband might feel like he's being undermined as the kids come from him. However, the wife's right to make decisions for the kids, especially regarding their welfare, is also valid. The school's stance on religious expression is a key factor here. If the school allows student-led religious activities, maybe the wife is overstepping. But if the school discourages it, she's protecting the kids.\n\nIn summary, the wife's actions could be justified to prevent potential school policy violations and her kids from being embarrassed. The husband's miffed reaction is understandable but maybe not the main issue. The school's guidelines and the kids' well-being are central here. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
