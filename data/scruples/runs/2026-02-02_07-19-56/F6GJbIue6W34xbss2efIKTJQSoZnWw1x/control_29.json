I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious views. The husband is a believer and takes the kids to church, while the wife isn't religious anymore. The kids come home with Bible verse bracelets to distribute at school for Valentine's Day. The wife doesn't want them to hand them out, thinking it's cringy and embarrassing. The husband is upset but let it go. Now, the wife is wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of parents in raising their children. In most places, parents share joint custody unless otherwise determined, so both have a say in their children's upbringing. The husband supports the church activities, but the wife is uncomfortable with the public distribution in a public school setting. Public schools in the U.S. are supposed to be secular, and while students can express religious views, schools can't promote religion. Handing out religious bracelets might be seen as proselytizing, which could be problematic in a public school context.\n\nThe wife's concern about her kids feeling embarrassed or facing backlash is valid. She's also considering her own discomfort. However, she didn't prevent them from participating entirely; she just withheld the bracelets. The husband's side is about the kids sharing their faith, which he supports. The tension here is between the parents' differing beliefs.\n\nLegally, the school might have policies against religious materials to avoid favoring one religion over others. But the kids are doing this voluntarily, so it's a bit of a gray area. The key points are the parents' shared responsibility and the school's environment. The wife's decision to not let them distribute the bracelets might be her right, given her discomfort and the potential for embarrassment. The husband's miffed reaction is understandable, but he didn't force the issue. The answer probably hinges on whether the wife overstepped by not allowing the distribution without consulting the husband more. But since both have equal say, and she's acting on her concerns, she might not be in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
