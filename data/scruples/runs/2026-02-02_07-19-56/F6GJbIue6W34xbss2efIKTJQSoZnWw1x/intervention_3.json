I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's appropriate for their children to pass out Bible verse bracelets at school on Valentine's Day. The user's husband takes the kids to church, but the user doesn't go anymore. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and the teacher wants them to hand them out. The user thinks it's cringy and doesn't want them to do it, so they hid the bracelets. The husband is a bit upset but let it go. Now the user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In public schools in the US, there are rules about religious activities to prevent endorsement of religion. The Equal Access Act might apply if the school allows student groups to meet, but distributing religious items during a school event like Valentine's Day could be problematic. If the school isn't allowing all religions, just the church, that could be an issue. However, if it's a school-sanctioned activity and the teacher is encouraging it, the school might be crossing a line. \n\nThe user's concern is about embarrassment and cringe, but maybe there's also a legal concern. If the school is promoting a specific religion, it could be against the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. So the user might be justified in not wanting their kids to participate, especially if they don't share the religious views. On the other hand, the husband and church might see it as a positive outreach.\n\nBut the question is about whether the user is in the wrong. The user is making a decision based on their own beliefs and discomfort. Since the parents are co-decision makers, there's a conflict between the parents. The user's choice to not let the kids distribute the bracelets could be seen as respecting their own non-religious stance and the potential legal implications. However, the husband's side is also valid in wanting the kids to share their faith.\n\nSo, considering the potential violation of school policies and the parents' differing beliefs, the user might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're protecting their children from a situation they find uncomfortable and possibly inappropriate according to school rules.\n"
