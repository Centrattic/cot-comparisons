I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong (AITA) regarding not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent (the author) isn't religious anymore, while their husband is. The kids go to church with dad and got these bracelets. The teacher wants them to give them out at school for Valentine's Day, but the author thinks it's inappropriate and hides them. The husband is upset, but the author is standing their ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing that. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. They want my opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nIn the US, schools and public institutions can't promote religion, thanks to the First Amendment. So, if the kids are being asked to distribute religious items in a public school, that might be a violation. The school can't endorse one religion, so the teacher's request might be problematic. That would support the author's decision to stop the kids from doing it, as they're protecting them from potential issues at school.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and church might see this as a religious activity that respects their beliefs. The author is making a choice based on their own non-religious views, which could be seen as imposing their values on the children. However, since the author is the one making the decision, maybe they have the right to decide what their kids do outside of church, especially in a public setting.\n\nBut wait, the school's role here is key. If the school is neutral and the kids are doing it on their own, maybe the author is overstepping. But if the school is involved, and the school can't enforce religious activities, then the author might be right to prevent it. Also, the children's embarrassment is a factor. The author is concerned about their kids feeling cringey, which is a valid emotional consideration.\n\nThe legal aspect is important here. In the US, laws like the Equal Access Act and the First Amendment prevent schools from promoting religion. So, if the school is part of this activity, the author's action is justified. However, if the kids are doing it voluntarily and the school allows it, the author's decision to stop them might be seen as interfering with the family's religious expression.\n\nBut since the author is making the decision about their children's activities, they have the right to set boundaries. The conflict here is between the parents' differing beliefs. The husband's religious views vs. the author's secular stance. The author is protecting the kids from potential school issues and their own discomfort, while the husband feels the activity is a part of their religious upbringing.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a choice that's about their comfort and the school's policies. However, there's also a right to religious expression. But in a public school setting, promoting religion isn't allowed, so the author is protecting the kids from potential backlash or the school's rules. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
