I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school. The situation involves religious upbringing and personal beliefs.\n\nFirst, the parents are in different faith situations. The husband goes to church, the wife doesn't. The kids attend church with him but she doesn't. The church activity involves giving out bracelets with a Bible verse for Valentine's Day. The author thinks it's cringy and inappropriate, so she hides them. The husband is upset, but she stands her ground.\n\nThe key points here are about the parents' rights and the kids' autonomy. Since the kids are young (6 and 8), they're likely not making independent decisions yet. The author is the one making the choice, which might be seen as conflicting with the husband's religious practices. However, the school is public, so there might be issues about promoting religion in public schools, which could be a factor.\n\nIn some places, there are laws about proselytizing in schools. If the school doesn't allow religious materials, the author might be protecting her kids from potential issues. But if the school is okay with it, then maybe the problem is more about personal comfort vs. religious expression.\n\nAlso, the husband's role in taking the kids to church and getting the bracelets might mean he expects them to participate. The author's decision could be seen as overriding his religious upbringing of the kids, which could create tension. But since she's the one raising the kids on a daily basis, maybe she has the right to make that call.\n\nAnother angle is the kids' embarrassment. The author mentions she'd be embarrassed for them. But at 6 and 8, kids might not share that same concern. However, the parents are responsible for their children's actions and social interactions.\n\nI think it's a balance between respecting religious expression and the parents' differing beliefs. The author isn't wrong for not wanting her kids to distribute religious items in a public school setting, especially if it could cause problems. But it's a complex situation with both sides having valid points. The answer might hinge on whether the school allows such activities. If it's allowed, then maybe the author is overstepping. If not, she's protecting her kids. But since the scenario doesn't mention school policy, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she's making a choice based on her comfort and possibly the school's stance, even if it's a conflict with her spouse.\n"
