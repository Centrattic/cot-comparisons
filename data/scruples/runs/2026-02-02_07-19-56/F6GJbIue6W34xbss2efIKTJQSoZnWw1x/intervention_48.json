I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting their kids to pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. The situation involves a parent who doesn't go to church anymore, and the husband does. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to give them out on Valentine's Day. The author put them away, and the husband is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Public schools in the US have rules about religious activities under the First Amendment, which prohibits schools from promoting one religion over others. Students can express their beliefs, but the school can't endorse or sponsor religious activities. So if the kids voluntarily want to give out bracelets, that might be okay. But if it's part of a school event like Valentine's Day, the school might have specific policies. The author is worried about embarrassment and appropriateness, which is a personal concern. They're worried about their kids being cringy and possibly facing backlash at school. The husband, on the other hand, supports the kids doing it. The tension here is between parental rights and religious upbringing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by not allowing the bracelets to be distributed. Legally, the parents have the right to make decisions about their children's education and upbringing, including religious education. So the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to allow the distribution. Ethically, it's about balancing the child's expression of religion versus the potential social impact. If the school allows such activities, the parents might feel they have a right to let their kids participate. However, the author isn't denying the kids the chance to share their family's beliefs because the husband supports that, but the author is making a different choice. So it's a conflict between the parents' differing beliefs. Since the author has the right to make decisions for their children, even if it differs from the spouse's views, they aren't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
