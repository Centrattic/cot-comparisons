I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. They don't want their kids to pass out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day. The husband goes to church, the author doesn't anymore. There's some marital tension here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, schools generally have policies against proselytizing, especially in public schools which are supposed to be secular. So if the kids are handing out religious items, the school might have an issue with that. The author's concern about it being inappropriate might be valid from a school policy standpoint.\n\nThen there's the child's perspective. The kids were given these bracelets by their Sunday school teacher. The parent who doesn't attend church (the author) is conflicted. They might feel that their children are being pushed into something the other parent supports. The author's decision to not let the kids use the bracelets could be seen as protecting their children from potential embarrassment or conflict at school.\n\nThe husband is upset because he supports the church activities. But the author's stance is about what's appropriate for a public school setting. There's also the aspect of parental rights\u2014both parents have a say, even if they disagree. Since the author is the parent, their decision to not allow the bracelets might be their right, especially if they believe it's not suitable.\n\nAnother angle is the children's autonomy. The author might be trying to shield them from situations where they could be singled out or made uncomfortable by handing out religious items. The school might discourage such activities to maintain a secular environment, which the author is respecting.\n\nSo considering all these points: school policy, parental rights, protecting children from embarrassment, and the potential conflict in the household. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a decision based on their beliefs and the school's environment. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
