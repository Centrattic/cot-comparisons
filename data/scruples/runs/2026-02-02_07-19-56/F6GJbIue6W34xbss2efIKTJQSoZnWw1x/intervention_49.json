I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. The situation involves religious differences between the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, schools have rules about religious expression to avoid endorsing any particular religion. Public schools can't promote religious activities, but students can engage in personal religious expression as long as it's not disruptive. So, if the kids are handing out religious bracelets, does that violate those policies? Maybe. The school might not allow it to prevent any perception of favoring one religion over others.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The husband supports the church activities, while the mother does not. They have different beliefs. The mother is concerned about the kids being embarrassed or causing issues at school. She's acting on her values here. The father is upset because he might see it as dismissing his faith. But she's also valid in her own beliefs.\n\nThe question is about whether the mother is in the wrong. If the school policy prohibits such activities, then she's actually doing the right thing by preventing them from violating that. But if the school allows personal religious expression, then maybe she's being too restrictive. However, even if allowed, the mother's discomfort and the potential embarrassment for the kids could be a valid concern.\n\nAlso, the fact that the teacher encouraged it might mean the school isn't fully aware of the policies. The mother might be protecting the kids from possible backlash or social issues at school. Since the bracelets have a website, it could be seen as an attempt to proselytize, which schools generally avoid.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the mother is acting in line with school policies and her own values, even though her husband disagrees. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
