I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting her kids to pass out Bible verse bracelets at school on Valentine's Day. The situation involves the parents' differing religious beliefs and the kids getting involved.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't attend church and has lost her faith, while her husband is a believer after they married. The kids are in a Sunday school class that gave them these bracelets to distribute at school. The author finds it cringy and embarrassing, so she hid them. The husband clarified the kids could choose, but the author still didn't let them take them. The question is whether she's wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, considering the parents' roles. In the US, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's religious activities, especially if they have differing beliefs. The school setting is public, so there's a line about proselytizing. The First Amendment mentions free exercise and non-establishment. Schools usually have policies against religious proselytization, so maybe the school doesn't support students handing out religious bracelets. The author's concern about cringe and embarrassment might not be the main legal point, but she's acting in what she believes is the kids' best interest.\n\nAlso, the husband was okay with the kids handing them out if they wanted, but the author overruled that. However, since both parents have equal rights, unless there's a custody issue or a court order, the author can make decisions regarding the kids' activities. The husband being miffed is part of the marital tension but doesn't necessarily make her wrong.\n\nSo, in terms of right vs. wrong, it's more about parental rights and the school's policies. If the school allows such activities, maybe the author overstepped by not letting the kids participate. But if the school discourages it, then she's protecting the kids from potential issues. But from a general perspective, parents can make decisions based on their beliefs. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
