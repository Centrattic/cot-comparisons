I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's appropriate for the kids to give out Bible verse bracelets at school.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The parent (author) doesn't go to church anymore and doesn't want her kids to distribute religious items at school. The husband does attend church and supports the kids doing this, but the author is against it. The school is public, so there's a line between church and state to consider.\n\nThe school probably has rules about proselytizing. Public schools in the US can't endorse religion, so students can't distribute religious materials unless it's part of a curriculum or a specific approved activity. If the teacher is asking the kids to give these out as part of a Sunday school activity, that might violate school policies. The author is concerned about the kids being embarrassed or facing embarrassment, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might see this as the kids sharing their faith, which is a personal right. However, the parent not of the faith is within her rights to object, especially since the school might not allow it. The author's action of hiding the bracelets could be seen as protecting her children from potential social issues or legal issues at school.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author is trying to prevent the kids from distributing religious items in a public school setting, which might be against school policies. The husband's side believes it's their right as citizens. But the school's stance is crucial here. If the school allows it, then maybe the parent is overstepping. If not, then the author is protecting the kids.\n\nBut the scenario says it's a public school, so the school might not allow religious distribution. The author's action is in line with following school rules. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she's preventing potential issues at school and protecting her kids from embarrassment. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
