I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. The situation involves religious upbringing differences between the parents. The husband goes to church, the wife doesn't anymore. The kids got the bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to give them out on Valentine's Day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, schools have rules about religious activities to maintain separation of church and state. If the school has a policy against proselytizing or distributing religious materials, the teacher might be violating that. The parents might have a right to object if the school isn't following its own rules.\n\nThen there's the parental rights angle. The parents have shared custody in terms of raising the kids. The husband's religious influence is present through church, but the wife isn't religious. The question is whether the school is an appropriate place for the kids to promote religion, especially without the non-religious parent's consent. The school might not be the best venue for such activities, considering the diverse beliefs of other students and their families.\n\nAlso, the kids are young, and being forced to distribute religious items could make them uncomfortable or cause social issues. The mother's embarrassment and concern about the kids feeling cringy is valid. She's protecting her children from potential social awkwardness or pressure.\n\nThe husband might feel his religious expression is being stifled, but the mother is asserting her right to influence her children's upbringing. Since they're in a shared custody situation, both have valid points. The school's role here is tricky too, as they might need to ensure that such activities don't infringe on other students' rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother isn't wrong because she's protecting her children's autonomy and considering the school's environment. The school might need to review its policies on religious activities. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
