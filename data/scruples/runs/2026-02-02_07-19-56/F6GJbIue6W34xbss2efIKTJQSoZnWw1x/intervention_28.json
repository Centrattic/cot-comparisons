I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day. The husband is okay with it since he takes them to church, but the author, who doesn't go to church anymore, thinks it's inappropriate.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about parental rights and religious expression in a public school setting. The author is worried about their kids passing out religious items, which might be seen as proselytizing in a public school. Public schools in the US have rules against promoting religion, right? The First Amendment prohibits government endorsement of religion, so schools can't promote or endorse religious activities. However, students can express their religious beliefs as long as it's not disruptive. But when you hand out religious materials, does that cross a line?\n\nAlso, considering the child's perspective: the kids are being encouraged by their Sunday school teacher to distribute these bracelets. The author is concerned about the kids feeling embarrassed or maybe facing backlash at school. They also mention personal discomfort since they don't share the husband's faith. The husband is upset because he feels the author is undermining his religious practices.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the school policy allows students to hand out items as part of Valentine's Day, like cards or bracelets, then the Bible verse bracelets might be okay. But if the school has policies against religious proselytization, then maybe the author is right to stop it. On the other hand, if the school allows it, the author might be overstepping by not letting the kids participate, especially since the husband supports it.\n\nAlso, parental rights: both parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs. Since the children are being raised in a religious environment by the husband, the author's decision to restrict the kids from expressing that religion might be conflicting with the husband's wishes. But the author has the right to their own beliefs too. It's a balancing act between both parents' views.\n\nIn some cases, parents might disagree on religious upbringing, and the child's best interest is considered. However, the school's environment and policies play a big role here. If the school doesn't allow religious items, then the author is protecting the kids from potential issues. If they do allow it, maybe the author is being too restrictive.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the school's policies. The author might not be in the wrong if they're following school rules. But if the school allows it, then perhaps the author is being overly cautious. However, the parent's rights are shared, so the husband's agreement to let the kids distribute might mean the author should have discussed it more rather than unilaterally deciding. But in this case, the author made a decision based on their own discomfort. It's a bit of a grey area. I think maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they are protecting their child from potential embarrassment and adhering to their own beliefs, even if it goes against the husband's wishes.\n"
