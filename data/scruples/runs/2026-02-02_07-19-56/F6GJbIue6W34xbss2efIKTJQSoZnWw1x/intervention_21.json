I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. The situation involves a religious difference between the parents. The husband goes to church, the author doesn't. The kids got these bracelets from church and wanted to give them out. The author thinks it's cringy and doesn't want them to hand them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, schools have rules about religious activities to prevent endorsement of religion. Public schools can't promote specific religions, so if the kids are handing out religious items during school time, that might be an issue. But the question is about the author's decision at home. The school might not even be involved if the kids are giving them out during their own time, but Valentine's Day is a school event. So maybe the school has policies about what can be given out.\n\nThen there's the parental authority aspect. Both parents have different views. The husband supports the kids participating, seeing it as their church activity. The author, however, disagrees. Since parents share custody, how do they resolve conflicting religious upbringing? In some cases, courts might consider the child's best interest, but this is a domestic situation. The author might have a right to protect the kids from what they see as embarrassment or inappropriate religious proselytizing, especially if the school frowns on it.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about embarrassment and cringe, not outright banning religion. They're not preventing the kids from practicing their religion at church, just not wanting them to share it in a public school setting. The husband is miffed but didn't push further. Maybe the author is balancing their own values against their spouse's. It's a conflict of parental rights.\n\nI think the answer depends on context. If the school allows it, maybe the author is overstepping, but if the school doesn't, then the author's decision is prudent. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong regardless of the school's policies. If the school allows it, the author might be in the wrong by preventing the kids from sharing their faith. But if the school doesn't, the author is protecting their kids. Since the user is asking for a general case, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to not want their children to engage in religious proselytizing in a secular environment, especially to avoid potential issues at school. Additionally, the author's decision is based on their own discomfort and concern for their kids' well-being, which is a valid parental consideration.\n"
