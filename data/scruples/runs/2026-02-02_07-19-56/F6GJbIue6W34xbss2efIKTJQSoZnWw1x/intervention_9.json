I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents have different religious views. The husband goes to church, the author doesn't. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to hand them out on Valentine's Day. The author thinks it's cringy and inappropriate for school, so she hid them. The husband is upset but dropped it. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points here are about parental authority, religious expression in schools, and the rights of parents versus the kids. In the US, there are laws about religious expression in public schools. For example, the Equal Access Act allows student groups to meet if the school allows other clubs, and students can express their religious views as long as it's not disruptive. However, schools can't promote a particular religion or coerce participation. \n\nThe author is preventing her kids from sharing their religious beliefs at school. Since the kids were given these bracelets by their school (Sunday school), and the school is encouraging the distribution, but the author is blocking it. But the school is part of the church, so maybe there's a concern about the school promoting religion. However, if the school is part of a church, it's a religious institution, so maybe it's allowed to have such activities. But when it comes to public school, there's more of a separation between church and state. Wait, the kids go to a public school, so the Sunday school is a church activity. The school might be violating the First Amendment if they're promoting religious activities in a public school setting. But the bracelets are being handed out in the public school as part of a school event (Valentine's Day). \n\nThe author is concerned about embarrassment and appropriateness. She's making a parental decision based on her values. The husband, who goes to church, might see it as part of their kids' religious education. But the author doesn't go to church and might feel that this is imposing religion on other students. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but the answer could depend on legal aspects and parental rights. In the US, parents have the right to direct the upbringing of their children, including religious instruction. So if the author believes that distributing religious materials at school is inappropriate, she has the right to make that decision. The school might have policies against proselytizing, but the scenario mentions that the Sunday school teacher encouraged it. \n\nHowever, public schools in the US can't promote religion, but students can express their beliefs as long as it's not coercive. If the kids are handing out bracelets voluntarily, that's allowed. But if the school is organizing it, it might cross the line. The author is preventing her kids from participating, which could be seen as her right as a parent. Alternatively, the husband's side might argue that the kids should be allowed to share their beliefs. \n\nThe author is caught between her and her husband's differing views. The answer might hinge on whose perspective is more valid. Since the author is the custodial parent (assuming primary custody), she has the authority. The husband's miffed reaction is mentioned, but he dropped the issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she's exercising her right as a parent. However, if the school is a religious institution, maybe the bracelets are part of their curriculum, and the author is interfering with that. But since the school is a public school, the church's involvement might be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the parent's right to make decisions about their children's activities, especially in a public school setting where there's a separation of church and state, the author might be justified in her decision. So the answer could be B for No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
