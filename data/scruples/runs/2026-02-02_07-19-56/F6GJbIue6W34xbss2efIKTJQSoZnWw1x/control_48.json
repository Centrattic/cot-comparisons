I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to hand out Bible verse bracelets at school. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents have different religious views. The husband is a believer and takes the kids to church, while the mother is not religious. The kids got the bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to distribute them at school. The mother finds this cringey and embarrassing, so she hid them. The father is upset but let it go. The key issue here is about parental rights and the child's participation in religious activities in a public school setting, especially regarding Valentine's Day, which is a secular event.\n\nIn public schools in the U.S., there are laws against school-sponsored religious activities. However, individual students are allowed to express their religious beliefs, as long as it's not disruptive. So, if the kids wanted to give out the bracelets on their own, it might be okay. But the mother is the one who decides not to let them take the bracelets. The question is whether her decision is wrong.\n\nFrom the mother's perspective, she might be protecting her children from embarrassment or peer pressure, especially in a diverse school setting. She might also be respecting the secular nature of the school event. On the other hand, the father sees it as his right to allow the children to share their religious views, as taught in church. The tension here is between the parents' differing beliefs and how they raise their children.\n\nThe key legal point is that the school can't require the kids to distribute religious items, but the parents have the right to decide what their children do outside of school. Since Valentine's Day is a school event, but the distribution is on the kids' initiative, maybe the parents have conflicting views on this. However, the mother's choice to not let the kids distribute them is her parental right. The school isn't forcing it; it's the church's activity. So she's not in the wrong for making that decision based on her own values.\n"
