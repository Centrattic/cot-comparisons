I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's husband takes their kids to church every Sunday morning, and the author doesn't attend. The husband became a believer after marriage, which caused some tension. The kids brought home Bible verse bracelets for Valentine's Day, with a teacher encouraging them to hand them out. The husband said the kids could do it if they wanted, but the author is uncomfortable and put the bracelets away, not letting the kids take them to school. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that they find it cringy and embarrassing for the kids and themselves. They might not want their children to engage in proselytizing at school, especially since it's a public school and the author isn't religious anymore. The husband, on the other hand, is a believer now and might think it's fine for the kids to share their faith. The key points here are about parenting rights, the children's autonomy, and the appropriateness of religious materials in a public school setting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, schools have policies against proselytizing or distributing religious materials, especially in public schools. The author might be protecting the kids from potential backlash or violating school rules. If the bracelets are part of a religious activity during school time, the school might have a problem with that. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nThen, there's the ethical angle. The parents have different beliefs now. The husband supports the church's activity, while the author does not. The children are exposed to both viewpoints. The author is concerned about the kids being embarrassed or the parent being embarrassed. It's a form of protecting the kids from social situations they might not be ready for or that could make them stand out. The husband might feel like the author is undermining his parenting or the church's teachings.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but I need to see both sides. If the kids wanted to do it and the author prevented it without considering their wishes, maybe that's an issue. However, the author is acting in what they believe is the best interest of the kids, preventing potential embarrassment or conflict. The husband's clarification that the kids could hand them out if they wanted gives the author a reason to be concerned, especially if the school doesn't allow such activities. On the other hand, if the school allows it and the kids are enthusiastic, the author's refusal could be seen as limiting the kids' ability to express their family's beliefs.\n\nI should also think about the parenting dynamic. Both parents have a right to influence their children's upbringing according to their beliefs. The husband's participation in church and the author's non-participation create a situation where they need to find a middle ground. The author's decision might be based on their own values, but if it's a school-organized activity, there could be rules against using school time for religious purposes. However, if the kids are just giving out bracelets during recess or as part of their own efforts, maybe it's a different scenario.\n\nIn some cases, schools have strict policies against religious materials in events like Valentine's Day to maintain a secular environment. The author could be right in keeping the bracelets from school if that's the case. But if the school is okay with it and the kids want to participate, the author's action might be seen as overstepping, especially if the husband agreed to the activity.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on the specific school policies and the children's autonomy. If the school allows it and the kids are willing, the author might be in the wrong. But if the school doesn't allow it or the author is concerned about the kids' comfort, then they might be justified. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if that's accurate.\n\nWait, the author said their husband clarified that the kids could hand them out \"only if they wanted.\" So the church activity is optional. The author is preventing the kids from doing it, possibly against their wishes. If the kids are old enough to understand and want to participate, the author's decision could be seen as limiting their choice. But if the author is worried about the kids facing social issues, it's a protective measure. The author might be in a position where they're trying to shield the kids from their own past discomfort, but maybe the kids are okay with it. The husband's miffed reaction suggests he might feel it's his right as a parent to allow it. In co-parenting situations where there's a difference in religious beliefs, it's complicated. The author's action could be seen as respecting the kids' exposure to their father's faith, or as imposing their secular views. I think in this case, the answer might lean towards B (no, the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a decision based on their own values and possibly school rules, but there's a nuance. If the school allows it and the kids want to do it, then maybe A. But if the school doesn't, then B. Since the scenario doesn't specify the school's stance, but mentions it's a public school, which typically avoids religious activities, the author's action might be justified. So the answer is B.\n"
