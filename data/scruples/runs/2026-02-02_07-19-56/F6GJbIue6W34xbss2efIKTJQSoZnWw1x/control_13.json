I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing their kids to pass out Bible verse bracelets at school on Valentine's Day. The husband goes to church with the kids, but the author doesn't anymore. She was raised in the church but lost her faith. The husband became a believer after marriage, so there's some tension there. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to give them out. The author thinks it's cringy and embarrassing, so she hid them. The husband is upset but let it go. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that she's comfortable with her decision because she doesn't want the kids to distribute religious material at school. She might be concerned about the school's stance on proselytizing, or she doesn't want the kids to feel pressured. Also, as a parent, she might prioritize her kids' comfort and avoid embarrassment. On the other hand, the husband and the church might see it as part of the kids' religious education and the church's outreach. The question is about whether the author overstepped by hiding the bracelets without consulting the kids or the husband properly.\n\nI should check if there are any school policies against distributing religious materials. If the school allows it, then the author's action might be seen as undermining the church's activities. But if the school frowns upon it, then she's protecting her kids from potential issues. Also, the author's personal beliefs vs. the husband's could be a factor here. The kids are being exposed to both parents' beliefs, which is a common situation in mixed-faith marriages. The key is whether the author's decision was reasonable given the circumstances. Since she didn't enforce the kids to distribute but just prevented it, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because parents have the right to make decisions based on their own values, even if it conflicts with the other parent's religious practices.\n"
