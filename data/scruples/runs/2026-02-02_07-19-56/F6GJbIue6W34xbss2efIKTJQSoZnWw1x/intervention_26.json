I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. The author's husband and kids got the bracelets from church, and the author feels it's inappropriate. The husband is upset but let it go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author has valid reasons: secular school, potential embarrassment, maybe concerns about proselytizing in a public school setting. On the other hand, the husband and church see it as a religious activity they chose to participate in, and the kids might want to share what they learned.\n\nIn the US, schools have rules about religious activities to avoid favoring one religion. Public schools can't endorse religion, but students can express their beliefs if it's voluntary and doesn't disrupt. If the kids are handing out religious items, that might be allowed if it's their own choice. But the school might have policies against it to prevent coercion or making others uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's hesitation isn't just about the school rules. They also mention personal embarrassment and the kids' possible cringe. That's a parent's right, but the husband feels the activity is part of their faith and the kids's choice. The author isn't forcing the kids; they had the option not to take the bracelets. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the husband might feel the author is undermining their family's religious practices. However, the author isn't stopping the kids from practicing religion at home, just not in a school setting where it could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the kids are young, so their understanding of why they're handing out bracelets might not be mature enough. The author's concern about their kids being embarrassed is valid. So considering all factors, the author's decision is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
