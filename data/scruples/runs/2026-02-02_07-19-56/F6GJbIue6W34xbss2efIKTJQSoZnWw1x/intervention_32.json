I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) not wanting their kids to give out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day. The husband supports the kids doing it because he goes to church and the teacher suggested it. The author isn't religious anymore and finds it cringey and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In public schools in the U.S., there are rules against school-sponsored religious activities due to the separation of church and state. But here, the kids are handing out the bracelets on their own, not as part of a school event. So maybe the school isn't directly involved, but the parent's decision might affect the kids' freedom to express their beliefs, especially since the father supports it.\n\nHowever, the parent's right to make decisions for their children includes what they're comfortable with regarding religious expression. The author might be prioritizing their own discomfort over the kids' involvement in their father's religious practice. But the husband is also a parent, so there's a shared responsibility. The question is whether the author is overstepping by preventing the kids from participating in an activity that the father endorses.\n\nAlso, the kids are young, so they might not fully understand the implications. The author could be protecting them from potential social issues at school. However, the father's religious beliefs are part of their upbringing, so the author's objection might create conflict in the family.\n\nThe key points are the parents' shared responsibility, the kids' age and understanding, school policies, and the balance between religious expression and personal comfort. The answer might depend on whether the author's decision is reasonable given these factors.\n"
