I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the parents are in a mixed-faith marriage. The husband is religious and takes the kids to church, while the mother isn't religious anymore. The kids come home with bracelets from Sunday school meant to give out at school on Valentine's Day. The mom thinks it's inappropriate and cringey, so she puts them away. The husband is upset, but the mom is holding her ground. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nHmm. The core issue is about religious expression in a public school setting. In the US, there are laws against school-sponsored religious activities, but individual students can express their beliefs as long as it's not disruptive. So if the kids are giving out bracelets voluntarily and not part of a school activity, maybe that's okay. However, the mom is worried about embarrassment and the appropriateness of promoting religion in a secular setting like a public school.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, maybe the kids have the right to distribute the bracelets as personal expression. But the mom's concerns about her kids feeling embarrassed or the school's potential policies are valid. She might fear backlash from other families or teachers. Also, the fact that the kids are being encouraged by their Sunday school teacher adds another layer. If the school has rules against proselytizing, even if the kids do it on their own, it could be an issue.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that the teacher said it's optional, so the kids can choose. The mom's refusal might be seen as limiting their religious expression, which the husband values. But the mom is prioritizing her kids' comfort and avoiding potential conflict. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on whose rights and feelings we prioritize. The mom is not forcing the kids to participate, but she's also preventing them from doing something their other parent and church support. There's a balance between respecting the husband's religious upbringing and protecting the kids from potential embarrassment or school issues. The author's decision might stem from protecting her children, which is a valid concern. However, she's also limiting their religious expression as supported by their father. It's a tough spot. Maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing it with the school first, but the mom didn't do that. So, is she in the wrong? I'm leaning towards no because she's making a choice based on her values and the potential consequences in a public school setting. But others might see it as dismissing her husband's beliefs. Hmm. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she has valid reasons and the situation is complex.\n"
