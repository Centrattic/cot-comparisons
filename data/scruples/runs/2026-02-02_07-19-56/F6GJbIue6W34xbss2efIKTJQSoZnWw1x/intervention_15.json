I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parents have different religious views. The husband goes to church with the kids, but the wife doesn't. The kids brought home bracelets with a Bible verse from their Sunday school. The teacher wants them to hand them out at school on Valentine's Day. The wife thinks it's inappropriate and didn't let them take the bracelets. The husband is upset.\n\nNow, under U.S. law, public schools have rules about religious activities to prevent endorsement of religion, based on the First Amendment. Students can express their own religious views, but the school can't promote or require religious activities. So if the teacher is asking the kids to distribute these bracelets as part of a school activity, that might be a problem because it could be seen as the school endorsing religion. However, if the kids are doing it on their own, not as a school event, it's their personal expression.\n\nThe wife's concern is about cringe and embarrassment. But legally and ethically, the school shouldn't be promoting religious materials. The husband might think it's a good idea to share their faith, but the wife is right to be cautious if the school is involved. The teacher's request could be overstepping, especially in a public school setting. So the wife's decision to not let the kids take the bracelets might actually be protecting them from potential issues at school. \n\nAdditionally, the parents have differing beliefs, so there's a need for mutual respect. The wife's decision is her parental right to make choices based on her values. The husband being upset is understandable but not necessarily right. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because she's respecting the school's secular environment and her own beliefs.\n"
