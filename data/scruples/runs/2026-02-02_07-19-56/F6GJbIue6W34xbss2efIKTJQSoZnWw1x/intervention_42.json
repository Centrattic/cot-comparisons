I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe person is a parent of two kids, 6 and 8. The husband takes them to church on Sundays, and the writer doesn't go anymore. The husband became a believer after they were married, leading to some tension. The kids come home with Bible verse bracelets (John 3:16) and cards for their classmates at a public school on Valentine's Day. The writer thinks it's inappropriate and embarrassing, so they put the bracelets away. The husband was okay with the kids handing them out if they wanted. The writer didn't let them take the bracelets, and now the husband is a bit upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Public schools in the US have guidelines about religious activities. There's a precedent that students can't be forced to participate in religious activities, and proselytizing in schools can be a problem. If the kids were handing out religious bracelets, that might violate school policies or the separation of church and state. So maybe the author is right to object on those grounds.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of the parent's role. Since both parents are involved in the kids' lives, the author might have a right to object to something they find uncomfortable. However, the husband supports the activity. Are parents allowed to have differing opinions? In cases where there's a joint custody or shared parenting, both parents have input. But if the school policy is strict, the author might be protecting the kids from potential issues at school.\n\nAnother angle: the kids are of an age where they might be influenced by their parents' beliefs. The husband wants them to share their faith, but the author doesn't. The author's decision could be seen as respecting their own non-religious views. But the husband's values are also part of the upbringing.\n\nIs there a legal issue if the kids hand out religious materials? In some cases, schools might not allow religious items in general. So by not letting the kids take them, the author might be preventing potential problems at school. The husband's clarification that the kids can choose to hand them out might mean it's not forced, but the school might still have a policy against it.\n\nAlso, the author's embarrassment is a personal feeling. Are they overstepping by imposing their discomfort on the kids? Or are they protecting the kids from possible embarrassment in a public school setting where such activities are discouraged?\n\nI need to check if handing out religious bracelets in a public school is allowed. According to some sources, while students can express their religious beliefs, schools can't promote religion. If the bracelets are given voluntarily and not part of a school program, it might be allowed, but it can vary by school district. If it's a school-sanctioned activity, then that's different.\n\nIn this case, the bracelets were given by the church, so if the school didn't endorse it, the parents might be responsible. The author's decision could be based on avoiding school conflicts. The husband might feel that the kids should share their faith, but the author might feel it's inappropriate given the school setting.\n\nSo, considering the potential school policies and the right of the parents to decide what's appropriate for their children, the author might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, if the husband's views are also valid, there's a conflict. But since the author's reason is about appropriateness and avoiding embarrassment, and possibly school policies, they might be justified. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
