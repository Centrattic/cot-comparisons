I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and her husband have different religious views. She doesn't go to church anymore, he does. The kids go to Sunday school with their dad, and they bring home these bracelets with a Bible verse. The teacher wants the kids to hand them out at school. The author thinks it's cringy and inappropriate, so she hides them. The husband is upset but let it go. Now, on Valentine's Day, she didn't let the kids take the bracelets. She's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here. The school is public, which in the US has rules about religious activities to avoid endorsing any particular religion. The bracelets have a Bible verse and a church website. Handing them out in a public school setting might be a problem under the First Amendment, which prohibits state-sponsored religion. The school might not allow that, especially if it's seen as proselytizing. The parents have to consider both the school's policies and the child's right to religious expression versus the school's obligation to remain neutral.\n\nThe husband supports his kids doing it, maybe thinking it's their right to express their faith. The author is against it, possibly because she doesn't want her children to feel embarrassed or because of her own lack of faith. She's also concerned about the school's reaction and possible embarrassment for the kids.\n\nIn the US, the Supreme Court case Lee v. Weisman (1992) said school-sponsored religious activities are unconstitutional. But individual students can express their religious beliefs as long as it's not disruptive. However, if the school is encouraging or endorsing the distribution, that's different. The teacher's request might be crossing a line, especially if the school isn't allowing other religious expressions equally.\n\nThe author's decision to prevent the kids from handing them out could be seen as protecting the children from potential issues at school. The husband's miffed reaction is understandable from his perspective, but he should respect the mother's decision if they agree to a compromise. Since the school is public, the mother's choice to avoid potential policy violations is prudent. She's not forcing the kids to do it; she's just not allowing it. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
