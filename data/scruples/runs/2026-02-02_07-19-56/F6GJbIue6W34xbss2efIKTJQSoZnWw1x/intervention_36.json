I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. The situation involves a parent who doesn't go to church but whose husband does. The kids were given these bracelets by their Sunday school teacher to distribute on Valentine's Day. The author put them away, not wanting them to do that, and the husband is upset. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In the US, schools often have rules about religious activities, especially in public schools, which are supposed to be secular. The First Amendment prohibits schools from promoting religion, but students can express their own religious views as long as it's not disruptive. So if the kids wanted to give out the bracelets, does that count as personal expression? Maybe, but the school might have specific policies against distributing religious materials to avoid endorsing any particular religion. The author might be trying to protect the kids from potential backlash or social issues at school.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents have different religious views. The husband is a believer, and the author isn't. They have joint custody of the kids' upbringing, so they might have differing opinions on what's appropriate. The author's decision could be seen as not respecting the husband's religious beliefs. But on the other hand, the author might be acting in the kids' best interest to avoid embarrassment or conflict in a diverse school setting.\n\nAlso, the kids are young\u20146 and 8. They might not fully understand the implications of handing out religious items in a public school. The author might be protecting them from situations where other kids or parents might not appreciate it, leading to social isolation or conflict.\n\nBut from another angle, the husband's side is that the kids were given the bracelets as part of their Sunday school activity. The teacher might have intended for them to share their faith, which is a religious right. The author's refusal could be seen as overstepping, especially if the kids themselves wanted to participate. However, the author is the parent, so they have the authority to make decisions about their children's activities.\n\nIs there a legal issue here? Probably not. The school might not allow the distribution of religious items, so the author might be preventing the kids from violating school rules. Alternatively, the school might allow personal religious expression, but the author is concerned about the kids being targeted or teased.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between religious freedom and the child's social well-being. The author is acting on their own beliefs, which might not be wrong, but the husband's feelings are also valid. It's a conflict of values in a co-parenting situation.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable. If the school allows such activities, then the author's refusal might be seen as restricting the kids' right to express their faith. But if the school has policies against it, the author is protecting the kids from potential issues. Since the author didn't know for sure, maybe they should have checked with the school first. However, the author's main concern is avoiding embarrassment and conflict, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision might not be in the wrong, especially if they're trying to protect the kids from social difficulties. However, they could have communicated better with the husband and perhaps discussed the school's policies. But given the information, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
