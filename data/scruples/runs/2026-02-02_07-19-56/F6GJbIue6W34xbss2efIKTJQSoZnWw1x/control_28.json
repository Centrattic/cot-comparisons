I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nThe kids got these bracelets from their Sunday school. The mom doesn't go to church anymore, and she's uncomfortable with the religious aspect. She put them away, not wanting the kids to hand them out. The husband is okay with it, but the mom is against it because she finds it cringy and embarrassing. The school is public, so there's a question about whether handing out religious items in a public school is allowed.\n\nFirst, public schools in the US have rules against proselytizing. So if the kids were handing out religious bracelets, that might be against school policy. The mom might be protecting the kids from potential issues at school. Also, the kids are 6 and 8, so they might not understand the implications of distributing religious materials. The mom's discomfort is valid, especially since she's not religious anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband goes to church, and the kids are part of Sunday school. The teacher might think it's a good way for the kids to share their faith. But the mom's right to make decisions about her children's activities is important. She's the parent, so she has the authority to decide what's appropriate for her kids. The school's policies probably support the mom's decision to prevent religious expression in the classroom.\n\nSo, considering the school rules, the kids' age, and the parents' differing beliefs, the mom isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her comfort and the school's guidelines. The answer should be B.\n"
