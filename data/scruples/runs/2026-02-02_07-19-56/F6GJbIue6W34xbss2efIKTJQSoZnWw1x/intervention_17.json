I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school during Valentine's Day. The author and their husband have different religious beliefs. The husband goes to church, the author doesn't. The kids got the bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to give them out. The author didn't want them to because it's cringey and they'd be embarrassed. Now, the husband is a bit upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and policy aspects. In public schools in the US, there are rules about religious expression. The Establishment Clause in the First Amendment prohibits schools from promoting religion, but students have their own rights to express their beliefs. However, if a school activity is organized by the church and involves students handing out religious items, there could be issues if it's seen as school-endorsed. The school might have policies against this to avoid favoring one religion over others. So, from a school policy standpoint, the author might be protecting their kids from potential issues at school.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The husband is upset because the kids were supposed to give out the bracelets. The author is doing what they believe is best for their children, based on their own beliefs and concerns about embarrassment. The husband supports the church's activity, but the author has a different perspective. This is a family conflict where both sides have valid points. The author isn't violating any laws, but they are going against their spouse's wishes. The key is the parent's responsibility to their child's well-being and their own religious views. Since the author is making a decision based on their values, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the husband might feel that the author is dismissing his religious practices. It's a balance between parental rights and religious freedom. The answer might hinge on whether the school allows such activities. If the school permits it, maybe the author's refusal is a personal choice. If the school discourages it, then the author is acting in the kids' best interest. Without more info on the school's stance, I'd lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're making a judgment based on their values and their child's comfort.\n"
