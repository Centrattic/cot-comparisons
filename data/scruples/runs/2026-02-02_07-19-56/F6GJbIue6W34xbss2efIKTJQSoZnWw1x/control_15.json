I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent (the author) who doesn't want their kids to give out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day. The husband goes to church, the kids come home with these bracelets, and the author is against it. She put them in a cupboard and didn't let the kids take them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, there are laws about religious expression in public schools. Students can express their beliefs, but the school can't promote a specific religion. So if the kids are giving out religious items voluntarily, it's allowed under the First Amendment. However, if it's part of a school-organized activity, that might be different. Here, the teacher asked them to hand out the bracelets, but the husband said it's only if they want to. The author didn't want her kids to do it, maybe because she's not religious anymore, or she's worried about the kids being embarrassed or the school environment.\n\nThen there's the aspect of parental rights. Parents have the right to raise their children according to their own beliefs. The author isn't religious, so she might be trying to protect her kids from religious activities that aren't in line with her views. The husband is religious and might feel that the author is undermining his parenting or their kids' religious education.\n\nIs the author wrong for not letting the kids take the bracelets? If the school allows religious expression and the kids are allowed to do it voluntarily, then maybe the author is overstepping by preventing them. But if she's uncomfortable and the school isn't promoting the activity, then maybe she has a right to decide based on her beliefs. Also, the kids are young, so their participation is influenced by their parents' guidance.\n\nAnother angle: the school is public, so there's a separation of church and state. If the school is involved in promoting the bracelet distribution, that could be problematic. But if it's the teacher's initiative and the school allows student-led religious expression, then it's more of a personal choice. The author's decision might be about her discomfort rather than the school's policy.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction. He's a believer, so he might feel the author is not respecting his religious upbringing of the kids. But the author has her own reasons. The key here is whether the author's actions conflict with the school's policies and the kids' autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because she's acting on her beliefs and protecting her kids from something they might find uncomfortable. However, if the school permits such activities and the kids are allowed to participate voluntarily, the author's decision could be seen as limiting the kids' ability to share their faith as encouraged by their father. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the author is against her own discomfort and the school isn't enforcing it, her choice is her right.\n"
