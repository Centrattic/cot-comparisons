I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their kids to hand out Bible verse bracelets at school on Valentine's Day. The kids go to a public school, and the parents have different religious views. The husband goes to church, the wife doesn't. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to give them out. The author put them away and didn't let the kids take them to school.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is at fault here. On one hand, the husband says the kids can choose, but the author decided not to allow it. The school is public, so there's likely a policy about religious materials. Also, the author is concerned about their kids being embarrassed and about their own embarrassment. But the husband is upset because he sees it as their choice. \n\nI need to consider the legal and policy aspects. Public schools in the US have rules against proselytizing or distributing religious materials, right? So if the kids hand out the bracelets, it might violate school policy. The author might be protecting the kids from potential issues at school. Also, the kids are only 6 and 8, so they might not understand the implications of giving out religious items. The author is an atheist now, so they might not want their kids to spread religious content without understanding. \n\nBut on the flip side, the husband's side is that the kids were encouraged to participate in their Sunday school activity. The author's decision might be seen as overstepping, especially if the kids wanted to partake. However, the parent has the right to make decisions about their children's activities, even if it conflicts with the other parent's beliefs. \n\nSo weighing both sides: the author is acting to prevent potential school policy violations and personal embarrassment, while the husband feels the kids should have the choice. Legally, schools do have restrictions, so the author's action might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
