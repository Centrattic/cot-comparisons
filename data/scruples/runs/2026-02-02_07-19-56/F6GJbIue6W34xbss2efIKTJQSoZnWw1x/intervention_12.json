I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a parent deciding not to let their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day. The husband supports the church activity, but the wife doesn't go to church anymore and finds it embarrassing. The kids got the bracelets from Sunday school, and the teacher suggested handing them out if they wanted. The wife put them away, and the husband is upset but let it go. Now, the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and school policies. In the US, there are laws about religious activities in public schools, especially regarding proselytization. The Equal Access Act allows student groups to meet, but schools can't promote one religion over others. If the school has a policy against religious activities during Valentine's Day, the wife might be justified in not allowing it. But if the school allows it, then maybe she's overstepping.\n\nNext, parental rights. Both parents have a right to raise their children according to their beliefs. The husband is involved in the church, and the wife isn't. The kids are attending Sunday school with the husband, so they might be getting religious education. The bracelets were given by their teacher in that class. The wife is blocking the kids from distributing them, possibly to avoid embarrassment or to avoid religious expression.\n\nReligious freedom is a factor. The family has a mixed religious background, so there's a balance between the husband's faith and the wife's secular views. The kids might be caught in the middle. The wife's decision could be seen as protecting her children from potential social backlash or her own discomfort, but the husband might feel she's denying the kids an opportunity to share their faith.\n\nAlso, the school's role. If the school allows such activities, then the parents have a right to choose whether their kids participate. The wife's refusal might be her way of managing her children's social interactions, but it's a personal choice. There's no clear legal wrong here, more of a conflict in parental preferences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the school's policies and the parents' rights. If the school permits the distribution, and the parents are equally involved in the decision-making, then the wife's choice is valid. However, if the husband's participation in church activities is part of the kids' upbringing, the wife's refusal might be seen as limiting that aspect. But given that the school might not support religious materials, and the wife's discomfort, it's a matter of personal choice. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
