I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are in a mixed-faith situation: the husband is religious and takes the kids to church, while the mother has lost her faith and doesn't attend. The kids got these bracelets from their Sunday school and were supposed to give them out at school. The mother thinks it's cringy and inappropriate, so she hid them. The husband is upset, but she went ahead and didn't let the kids take them. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The school is public, so there are likely policies about religious activities. In the US, there are laws about separation of church and state in schools. If the kids are supposed to distribute religious items in a public school, that might be against the rules. So the mother might be right to prevent that to avoid any legal or policy issues. Also, the mother is concerned about her kids being embarrassed, which is a valid parental concern. The father might feel like she's undermining his religious practices with the kids, but the mother is also a parent and has her own values now. \n\nBut then, the husband said the kids could choose, but the mother overruled that. Maybe the father feels like the kids should have the right to share their beliefs if they want, but the mother is prioritizing avoiding embarrassment and legal issues. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, considering school policies and the mother's responsibility to protect her kids from potential embarrassment or conflict at school, her decision might be justified. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
