I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe parents are in a mixed-faith marriage. The husband is religious and takes the kids to church. The wife used to be religious but isn't anymore. The kids get these bracelets from church and are supposed to hand them out at school on Valentine's Day. The mom thinks it's cringey and doesn't want them to do it, so she hides the bracelets. The husband is upset but let it drop. The question is whether the mom is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In the US, schools have policies about religious activities to avoid violating the separation of church and state. If the kids are giving out religious items in a public school setting, that might be against school rules. So the mom might be protecting her children from potential issues at school.\n\nAlso, parental rights come into play. Both parents have a right to raise their children according to their beliefs, but there's a conflict here. The husband wants to share his faith through the church activities, while the mom is against it. The mom is making a decision to not support the distribution, which the husband disagrees with. But since the school might have rules against it, her decision could be reasonable.\n\nAnother angle is the child's autonomy. The kids are young, so their ability to make independent choices is limited. The parent is acting as a guardian, so her decision not to let them give out the bracelets could be seen as protecting them from embarrassment or social backlash, as she mentioned feeling embarrassed.\n\nHowever, the husband's side is that the church activity is part of their religious upbringing. If the school allows other types of bracelets (like for awareness campaigns), maybe the church's bracelets are being treated differently, which could be a point. But the key is whether distributing religious materials in a public school is permitted. If it's not, then the mother is right to prevent it.\n\nI think the mom isn't in the wrong because she's considering the school's policies and her own comfort, plus protecting the kids from potential embarrassment. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
