I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent not wanting their kids to pass out Bible verse bracelets at school during Valentine's Day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The husband is religious, goes to church every Sunday, and the kids got these bracelets from Sunday school. The author doesn't go to church anymore and is okay with their husband's faith but is uncomfortable with the kids handing out religious items at school. The school is public, so there might be concerns about separation of church and state, or just not wanting the kids to be seen as pushing religion on others.\n\nThe author put the bracelets away and didn't let the kids take them. The husband is upset but let it go. The question is: is the author in the wrong?\n\nI should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, public schools have guidelines about religion, so handing out religious items might not be allowed. If the school prohibits it, the author is right to prevent that. But even if it's allowed, the parent's right to raise their children according to their beliefs might come into play. The author's decision is protecting their kids from potential embarrassment or conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on their personal discomfort and concern for the kids' embarrassment. They didn't force the kids to do anything; they just withheld the items. The husband's side is about respecting the church's activity, but the parent has the right to set boundaries based on their values.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author is acting in the kids' best interest, respecting their own beliefs, and possibly adhering to school policies. The husband's miffed reaction is about his religious expression, but the parent isn't stopping the kids from being religious, just not in a public school setting. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
