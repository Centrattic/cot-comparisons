I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent (the author) deciding not to let their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school during Valentine's Day, even though the other parent (husband) supports it. The school is public, so there's a potential issue with separating church and state.\n\nFirst, the author isn't religious anymore, while the husband is. They have different beliefs, which is a common scenario. The kids are being taught in Sunday school to distribute these bracelets, which include a religious message. The school is public, so there's a line about religious activities in public schools. I remember that in the US, the First Amendment prevents schools from promoting religion, but students can express their own beliefs as long as it's not forced on others. So if the kids are choosing to hand out the bracelets, it's okay, but if it's mandatory or part of a church's push, it might be problematic.\n\nThe author is concerned about the kids being embarrassed and the potential for the school to be seen as endorsing religion. They also don't want their children to feel pressured to share their father's religion. However, the husband believes the kids should have the choice. The author's action was to hide the bracelets, not to force the kids to distribute them, but to prevent it. \n\nNow, considering the law and school policies, distributing religious materials in a public school can be a gray area. The school might not allow it if it's seen as promoting a specific religion. The author's hesitation could be based on protecting their children from potential backlash or ensuring the school doesn't violate secular policies. On the other hand, the husband's view is about respecting the kids' choice, but if the school disallows it, the kids might face disciplinary action.\n\nMoral responsibility: The author is making a decision based on their own beliefs and concern for their children's well-being. The husband is acting on his faith. Since the school's policy isn't clear here, it's hard to say definitively. However, in a public school setting, the author might be right to be cautious to avoid religious imposition. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting their kids and respecting the school's secular environment. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
