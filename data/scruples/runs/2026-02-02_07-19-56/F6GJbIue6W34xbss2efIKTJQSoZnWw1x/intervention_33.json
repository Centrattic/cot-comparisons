I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author doesn't go to church anymore, and her husband does. The kids go with him to Sunday school and come home with these bracelets. The teacher wants them to hand them out to classmates for Valentine's Day. The author thinks it's cringy and embarrassing and put the bracelets away. The husband is a bit upset but dropped it. Now the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nI remember that in public schools, there are laws about religious activities. In the U.S., the First Amendment prohibits public schools from promoting religion. However, students can express their own religious views as long as it's not coercive. So if the kids are handing out the bracelets voluntarily, maybe that's allowed. But if the school or teacher is encouraging this as part of a class activity, that might be a problem.\n\nThe author is concerned about embarrassment and not wanting their kids to proselytize. They also don't want to support the church's outreach through their kids. The husband is a believer, so there's a conflict between their values.\n\nBut here's the thing: as a parent, you have the right to make decisions for your children regarding their participation in religious activities, especially if you're not comfortable with it. However, the school might have a policy against proselytizing. If the school allows it, then the author's decision might be seen as overstepping, but if the school isn't allowing it, then the author is protecting their kids from a potentially inappropriate assignment.\n\nWait, the post says the kids came home with the bracelets and the teacher wants them to hand them out. The husband clarified they can choose not to. But the author still put them away. The key here is whether the school has a policy against this. If the school allows it, then maybe the author is being overly cautious. But if the school is promoting religious activity, then the author is right to stop it.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to make that choice for their children, especially considering the school's environment. Also, the husband isn't the one making the decision here; the author is the parent who's more involved in the kids' daily lives. Plus, the author's discomfort is valid. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
