I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent (the author) who doesn't want their kids to give out Bible verse bracelets at school on Valentine's Day. The husband goes to church with the kids, the author doesn't. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and were supposed to hand them out. The author thinks it's cringy and embarrassing, so she hid them. The husband is a bit upset but let it go. Now, on Valentine's Day, the author didn't let the kids take the bracelets to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, there are laws about religious expression in public schools. The First Amendment prohibits government endorsement of religion, but students can express their own religious views. However, if the school is promoting a specific religion through an activity, that could be an issue. Here, the kids are handing out religious items, which might be seen as an endorsement if the school is involved. But the teacher's instruction to hand them out might be part of a school activity, which could be problematic if it's school-sponsored. But the question is whether the parents are in the wrong for not allowing it.\n\nThen there's the parental rights aspect. As a parent, the author might have the right to make decisions about their children's activities, especially regarding religion. Since the author isn't religious anymore, she might feel that participating in distributing religious material goes against her beliefs. The husband, being the one who goes to church, might want the kids to participate, leading to conflict. However, the parents are co-guardians, so they need to agree on major decisions. The author hid the bracelets without discussing it further with the husband, which could be seen as a parental decision without full agreement. \n\nThe school's role is important here. If the school allows such activities, it might be up to the parents. But if the school is promoting religious activities, that's a different story. The kids were given the bracelets in Sunday school, which is part of the church, not the school. However, if they're supposed to hand them out at school, there might be a conflict between the school's policies and the parents' beliefs. The author might be protecting her kids from potential embarrassment or discrimination, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key points are: the parents' right to make decisions about their children's religious activities, the school's policies on religious expression, and the conflict between the parents' beliefs. The author's action is about respecting her own values and possibly protecting her children from social issues. The husband might feel his religious expression is being suppressed, but as a parent, the author has a right to make such decisions. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
