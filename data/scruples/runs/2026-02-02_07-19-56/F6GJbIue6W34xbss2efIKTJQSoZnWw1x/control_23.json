I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should let their kids give out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband goes to church with the kids, the wife doesn't. The kids get these bracelets from Sunday school and are supposed to hand them out. The wife is against it, thinking it's cringy and embarrassing. She puts them in a cupboard and doesn't let the kids take them. The husband is upset but let it go.\n\nSo, the key points here. The school is public, and giving out religious items might be a problem. There's a legal aspect\u2014public schools in the US can't endorse religion, but students have the right to express their beliefs. However, if the school is promoting the distribution of religious materials, that might be different. But the teacher is asking the kids to do it as part of Sunday school, so the school might not be involved. \n\nThe wife's concern is about embarrassment and not wanting her kids to pass out religious stuff in a public school setting. She's also an atheist now, so maybe she doesn't want her kids exposed to that. The husband is religious, so there's a conflict in parenting styles. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the kids are doing it on their own time and not as part of school activities, maybe it's okay. But if the school is involved, maybe the school is crossing a line. However, the wife's decision to prevent the distribution is based on her own beliefs. She's the parent, so she has a say in what her kids do. The husband is also a parent, but since they're married, they need to work this out together. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not letting the kids take the bracelets. The TOS (AITA) typically considers both sides. The wife's reasons are valid\u2014she doesn't want her kids to be embarrassed, and she's not religious. The husband might feel like she's dismissing his beliefs. But as a parent, she has the right to guide her children's behavior based on her values. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's making a parenting decision based on her comfort and the school's public nature. The husband should work with her, not just dismiss her concerns. There's no clear right or wrong, but since the wife is acting on her beliefs and the school's context, she's probably not in the wrong.\n"
