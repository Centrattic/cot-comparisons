I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids pass out Bible verse bracelets at school on Valentine's Day. \n\nFirst, the context: The husband goes to church with the kids on Sundays, the wife doesn't. The kids got the bracelets from Sunday school, and the teacher wants them to give them out to classmates. The wife finds it cringy and embarrassed, so she put them away. The husband is okay with the kids doing it if they want, but the wife is against it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The school is public, which means it's supposed to be secular. Valentine's Day is a school event, and the kids are being asked to distribute religious materials. In the US, there are laws about separation of church and state in public schools. Teachers can't promote religion, and students shouldn't be pressured to participate in religious activities. But what about voluntary distribution of religious items?\n\nThe wife is worried about appropriateness and embarrassment. Maybe she's concerned that it could lead to discrimination or that the school might not support religious promotion. On the other hand, the husband thinks it's okay if the kids want to do it. The parents have different views on religion, which is causing tension.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, can the school allow students to distribute religious bracelets? I think in the US, students can express their religious beliefs as long as it's not disruptive. If the kids are doing it voluntarily and not forced, it might be protected. But the school might have policies against it to maintain neutrality. The wife's action is preventing the distribution, which might be seen as respecting the school's secular environment.\n\nEthically, the parents have the right to raise their children in a way that aligns with their own beliefs. However, the husband's approach is more about letting the kids participate in their church activities. The wife's decision is about not wanting her kids to express religious views in a public school setting, possibly to avoid conflict or to keep the school environment neutral. \n\nBut the kids are getting the bracelets from the church. The teacher is part of the church program. The school might not be the right place for such distribution, especially if it's a school event. The wife might be protecting the kids from potential social issues, like classmates thinking they're being pushed to adopt a religion. \n\nThe husband's clarification that the kids can choose is important. However, the wife is the one making the final decision here. She's acting from her perspective as a parent, maybe to prevent her kids from being embarrassed or to avoid any backlash from a secular school environment. \n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, both have valid points. The husband might feel the kids should have the choice, while the wife is concerned about the context (school) and appropriateness. The answer might hinge on the school's policies and the parents' agreement on their children's upbringing. Since the wife is against it and the school is public, her stance seems reasonable. So, AITA? The wife's actions are based on her values and avoiding a potentially problematic situation in a secular setting. The husband's miffed reaction is about the children's autonomy, but the wife isn't in the wrong for making a decision based on her concerns. Answer B.\n"
