I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not letting their kids hand out Bible bracelets at school.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are in a mixed-faith marriage. The husband goes to church, the wife doesn't. The kids got bracelets from church to give out on Valentine's Day. The mom thinks it's cringy and doesn't want them to bring them to school, so she hides them. The husband is upset, but the mom is unsure if she's wrong.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the mom is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nIn the US, there are laws about separation of church and state in public schools. Students can't proselytize during school hours, but they can express their beliefs as long as it's not disruptive. However, if the school has a policy against distributing religious materials, that might be a factor. The school isn't mentioned here, so maybe that's a gray area.\n\nThe mom's reasoning is about embarrassment and thinking it's inappropriate. She's not forcing the kids to do it, but she's taking away the option. The husband says the kids could hand them out if they wanted, so the mom is overriding that. \n\nParental rights come into play here. Both parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs. The husband is encouraging the kids to participate in church activities, while the mom is preventing them from doing an activity that promotes religion. But the kids are old enough to maybe have their own opinions, though they're only 6 and 8. \n\nIs the mom violating the husband's rights by blocking the church activity? Or is she protecting the kids from potential embarrassment or peer pressure? The school's role isn't clear, but if it's allowed, then maybe the mom is overstepping. If the school doesn't allow religious materials, she's acting in the kids' best interest.\n\nAnother angle: The bracelets are being handed out on Valentine's Day in a public school. Some might see it as promoting a specific religion in a secular setting, which could be controversial. The mom might be avoiding potential backlash or conflict at school. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that the kids have the choice, but the mom is taking away that choice. But the mom might feel that allowing it could cause issues at school or make the kids feel pressured. \n\nSo, is it the mom's right to decide, or does the husband have a say as well? Since they are co-parents, they should ideally agree. The mom's action is unilateral, which could be seen as dismissive of the husband's and possibly the church's wishes. \n\nHowever, the mom's discomfort and wanting to avoid embarrassment is understandable. It's a personal choice, but does that extend to the kids' actions in school? Public schools often have policies against religious proselytizing, so the mom might be acting within those guidelines. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a toss-up. The mom's actions could be seen as protecting the kids from potential issues at school, but she might be overstepping by not letting them decide. But since the kids are young, parents have the right to make decisions. The answer hinges on whether the school allows such activities and the parents' shared values. Given the info, I think the mom is not in the wrong because she's respecting different beliefs and avoiding potential school problems.\n"
