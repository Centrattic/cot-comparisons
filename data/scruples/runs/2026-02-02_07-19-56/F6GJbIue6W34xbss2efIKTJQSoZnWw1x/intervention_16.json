I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their kids to pass out Bible verse bracelets at school for Valentine's Day, while the husband is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author doesn't go to church anymore, the husband does, and they have children. The kids got these bracelets from Sunday school and wanted to give them out at school. The author is uncomfortable because they find it cringy and embarrassing, so they hid the bracelets. The husband is upset but let it go. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should think about parental rights and responsibilities. Both parents have the right to influence their children's upbringing, especially regarding religion. However, when it comes to what the kids do in school, there might be school policies against proselytizing. In some schools, students aren't allowed to distribute religious materials because of the separation of church and state. If that's the case, the author might be right to prevent the kids from doing it to avoid potential issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband argues the kids could choose, so the author stepping in could be seen as overruling the kids' choice, even if the school allows it. But the author's concern is about embarrassment and the school's policies. The author might be protecting the kids from possible social discomfort or school reprimands.\n\nAlso, the kids are only 6 and 8, so they might not fully understand the implications. The parents have a duty to guide their children's decisions, especially in a public school setting where there are rules about such things. If the school has rules against distributing religious items, the author is doing the right thing.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' differing beliefs. The husband wants the kids to engage with their church, while the author doesn't. The conflict here is about whose values take precedence. But when it's about school activities, the school's policies and the child's well-being should be the priority.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might not be in the wrong if they are following school rules and protecting their kids from potential embarrassment or disciplinary action. However, if the school allows it and the kids are just sharing bracelets, the author's decision could be seen as imposing their personal discomfort on the children's choices. But since the author is the parent, they have the authority to make such decisions, especially if there's a valid reason like school policies or protecting the kids' feelings.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they are making a decision based on their values and possibly school rules, and they have the parental right to guide their children's actions in such scenarios.\n"
