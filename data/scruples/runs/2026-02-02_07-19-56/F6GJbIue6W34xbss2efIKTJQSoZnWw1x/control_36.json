I don't go. Although I was raised in the church and it wasn't a terrible experience, somewhere along the way I lost my faith. My husband became a believer after we were married, so this causes a bit of tension in our marriage. Anyway, on Sunday the kids come home with a giant bag of rubber bracelets with bible verse John 3:16 stamped on it. It is attached to a little card that states what the bible verse is, what is means, and a website for the church. They said their Sunday school teacher wants them to hand them out to their classmates at their small public school on Valentine's Day. My husband clarified that they were to hand them out only if they wanted. Oh hell no! I told them I wasn't sure it was appropriate and promptly put them away in a cupboard. I find it cringy and frankly I would be embarrassed for them, as well as for myself if they took them to school. My husband is a bit miffed at me but dropped the issue for now. So come Valentine's Day, and I don't open the cupboard to let them take them to school, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the kids getting Bible verse bracelets for Valentine's Day from church and the author not wanting them to distribute them at school.\n\nFirst, the author isn't religious anymore, while the husband is. The kids go to church with him, so they're exposed to that environment. The bracelets come home, and the author is against them giving them out at school. She put them away because she finds it cringy and embarrassing. The husband is a bit upset, but the author is standing her ground.\n\nSo, the key points here are religious expression in a public school setting and parental rights. In the US, there are laws about religion in public schools. Students can't be forced to participate in religious activities, but they can express their own beliefs voluntarily. However, if the school has policies against distributing religious materials, that could be an issue. \n\nThe author is concerned about the kids handing out religious items in a public school, which might clash with the school's policies or other parents' views. She also mentions she's embarrassed, which is a personal feeling, but is there a legal or ethical issue? The husband's side is about the kids participating in what they did in church. \n\nBut the author has the right to make decisions for her children regarding their upbringing, including religious aspects. Even though the husband takes them to church, the author isn't, and the decision to not distribute the bracelets is within her parental rights. The school might have their own rules, but the author is making a choice based on her comfort and the potential for the school to have issues with it.\n\nSo, considering the parents' differing beliefs and the context of public school policies, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's making a choice that aligns with her current views and protecting her children from potential embarrassment or conflict. The husband might feel the kids should share their beliefs, but the author's decision is valid under her parental authority. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
