      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the manager (the author of the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off for the entire summer. The coworker is a direct report, so the manager has the authority to approve or deny PTO.\n\nFirst, the coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off. That's a lot of time off, especially considering that if they take every Monday, they'd have a three-day weekend each week. The manager is questioning why the coworker thinks this is acceptable, implying that maybe there's a policy or team expectations they're not following. \n\nThe manager's response\u2014denying the request\u2014seems reasonable because granting such a long stretch of time off could disrupt team operations, create scheduling issues, or set a problematic precedent. The coworker might not have considered how this affects the team or the manager's ability to manage workloads. Additionally, PTO policies usually require approval, and the manager isn't obligated to agree to every request, especially if it's excessive or not in line with company guidelines.\n\nThe coworker's justification isn't provided here, so without knowing if there's a valid reason (like a family event every Monday), the manager's decision to deny the request isn't unreasonable. The manager's job is to ensure the team functions smoothly, so this seems like a responsible action. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
