      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a co-worker, who reports to the author, has scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. The author is upset and is asking if they're in the wrong for denying this request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the coworker is allowed to take PTO as per the company's rules, then maybe the author can't just deny it without cause. But wait, the coworker is asking for every Monday off all summer. That's a lot of time off. If the team needs coverage on Mondays, then taking all of them off could cause problems. The author is the supervisor, so they might have to ensure that the team's workload is covered. \n\nBut the coworker is using PTO, which is personal time. Unless there's a policy against taking multiple Mondays in a row, the author might not have a right to deny it. However, if the coworker's absence would impact the team's operations, the author might need to consider that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for denying the request. \n\nAlso, the coworker is asking for a specific schedule. If the author didn't approve it, maybe the coworker should have been given a reason why. If the author denied it without explanation, that could be an issue. But maybe the author is within their rights if the coworker's request isn't aligned with team needs. \n\nAnother angle: in some companies, PTO is up to the employee to manage, but if the coworker's absence would affect team performance, the manager can require adjustments. The key is whether the author has a valid reason related to work. If the author denied it because they just don't like the idea of 3-day weekends, that's personal bias. But if it's because the team needs coverage, then it's justified.\n\nSo the answer depends on the reason for denial. If the author denied it without a valid work-related reason, then they might be in the wrong. But if there's a legitimate operational need, then they're not. The original post doesn't specify the reason, but the author's question is whether they're in the wrong for denying. The options are A or B. Given that the coworker is using PTO, unless there's a policy violation, the author might not have a right to deny it. So the answer could be B. But maybe the author is in the wrong if there's no valid reason. The original post's author seems confused, saying \"I'm not sure why he thinks that's okay,\" which might indicate they're being strict without cause. So maybe B is correct.\n"
