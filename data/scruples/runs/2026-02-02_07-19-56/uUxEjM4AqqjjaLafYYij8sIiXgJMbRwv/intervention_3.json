      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker, who reports to the author, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused and thinks it's not okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and the coworker has enough accrued time, then maybe the coworker was within their rights to take those days. But if there are limits or if the author has the authority to approve or deny such requests, the situation changes. \n\nIn most workplaces, managers can deny PTO requests if it's not feasible for the team or business needs. So if the coworker's request would disrupt operations, the author might be justified in denying it. However, if the company allows using PTO as long as it's scheduled, and the coworker followed the proper process, the author might be overstepping by denying it without a valid reason.\n\nAlso, the coworker's request for three-day weekends might be a personal choice, but the author could be concerned about coverage or workload. The coworker might need to coordinate with others to cover their shift, but if the company allows it, the author's denial could be seen as unfair unless there's a specific reason.\n\nThe key factors here are company policy and the reason for the denial. If the author denied it without a valid business reason, they might be in the wrong. If there's a policy against taking multiple Mondays off or if the coworker didn't follow the proper procedure, the author is justified. But if it's allowed and the author just disagrees with the coworker's choice, that's a different matter.\n\nSince the original question states that the coworker scheduled the PTO and the author is unsure why it's okay, it's possible the author is enforcing a policy or business need. However, without explicit policy details, it's hard to say. Typically, PTO is at the employee's discretion unless there's a business impact. So, if the coworker's absence doesn't affect the team and they followed protocol, the author denying it might be in the wrong. But if there's a valid operational reason, the author is justified. The answer hinges on whether the denial is based on policy or arbitrary.\n"
