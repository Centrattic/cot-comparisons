      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is a guy who reports to the author, so the author is their manager.\n\nFirst, the co-worker asked for 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. The author is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's okay and is denying the request. They mention that if approved, the co-worker would have 3-day weekends all summer, which the author seems to find unreasonable.\n\nSo, why would the author be in the wrong? Well, if the company's PTO policy allows for such requests, the manager might be overstepping by denying it without a valid business reason. Employees often have the right to schedule PTO as they see fit, provided it doesn't disrupt operations. If the co-worker's absence on Mondays doesn't affect team performance or deadlines, the manager shouldn't unreasonably deny it. However, if the author has a legitimate reason, like operational needs or other team members being affected, then they're justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong if the company's policy restricts consecutive days off or if the co-worker's request conflicts with workload. The key here is whether the author followed the company's PTO guidelines. If the policy allows for such time off and the author denied it without cause, then they might be wrong. But if the author has a business reason, like needing coverage on Mondays, then it's reasonable.\n\nThe original question is phrased as \"Am I tripping?\" which suggests the author is questioning their own reaction. The answer depends on company policy and context. Since there's no mention of specific policies or operational issues in the question, it's hard to say. But generally, unless there's a business justification, denying PTO as requested could be seen as overstepping. However, since the co-worker is under the author, the manager has some discretion. \n\nGiven the information provided, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because they are the manager and have the authority to approve or deny PTO based on team needs. The co-worker might need to provide a reason for the request, but the author's denial here seems within their rights unless the policy explicitly allows for such time off without question. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
