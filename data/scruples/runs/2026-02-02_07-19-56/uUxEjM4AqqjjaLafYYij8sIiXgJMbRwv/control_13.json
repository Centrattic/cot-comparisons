      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is a manager because they mention a co-worker who \"reports to me.\" The co-worker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The manager is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's okay and is denying the request. The user wants to know if the manager is wrong for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the co-worker is requesting a lot of time off (every Monday for 14 weeks), and the manager is denying it. The manager is the one in authority here. In most workplaces, managers have the final say on PTO requests, especially when it comes to scheduling. If the co-worker didn't have approval for these days off, the manager is within their rights to deny them. However, if there's a policy that allows for such time off and the co-worker followed the proper procedures, it might be different. But the post doesn't mention any specific policy, so we have to assume the manager's role is to manage such requests. \n\nThe manager is questioning why the co-worker thinks taking every Monday off is acceptable. That suggests the manager might not have agreed to it beforehand. So, the manager is denying an unauthorized request. Denying that seems reasonable. Therefore, the author (the manager) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
