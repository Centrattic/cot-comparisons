      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is a manager, denied a co-worker's request to take every Monday off for PTO all summer. The co-worker scheduled 14 Mondays, which would mean taking every Monday off for the summer. The author is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's okay and is denying the request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. Typically, PTO (Personal Time Off) is something that employees can use for personal days, but they usually need to get approval from their manager. If the co-worker is asking for a large block of time off, especially every Monday, the manager has the authority to approve or deny based on team needs and the company's policies. \n\nThe key points here are: the co-worker scheduled 14 Mondays, which is a significant amount of time. The manager is denying the request, which is their role. Unless the company has a policy that allows for such extensive PTO without restrictions, the manager is within their rights to say no. The co-worker might not be following the proper procedure, like submitting the request in a timely manner, or maybe the job requires coverage on Mondays. \n\nAlso, the author is a manager, so it's their responsibility to ensure that the team's workload is covered. If the co-worker's absence would create issues, the manager has to protect the team's performance. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for denying the request. The answer should be B.\n"
