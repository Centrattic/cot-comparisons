      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a co-worker (who reports to them) scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. The author is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's okay and is denying the request.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong for denying the PTO. The key points here are about company policy, the role of the author (are they a manager?), and the reasonableness of the request. The co-worker is taking every Monday off all summer, which is a lot of time. If the company allows PTO and the co-worker has the time off approved, maybe the author has the authority to deny it. But maybe the co-worker didn't need approval. Wait, the user says \"scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO.\" So the co-worker scheduled it, but the author is denying it. So the co-worker might have scheduled without proper approval?\n\nWait, the author says \"a guy who reports to me scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off.\" So the author is in a supervisory role. If the company's PTO policy allows this, then the co-worker might have the right to schedule time off, but the author might have the authority to deny it if it's not feasible for the team. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for denying the request if it's disrupting work. The co-worker might need to coordinate with their manager. So the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
