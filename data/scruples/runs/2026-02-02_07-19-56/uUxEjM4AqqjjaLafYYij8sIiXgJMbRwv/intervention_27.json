      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off during the summer. The context is that the coworker, who reports to the author, had scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO (Personal Time Off). The author is questioning the coworker's assumption that this is acceptable and clarifies that they aren't okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The author is a manager or supervisor since the coworker reports to them. The coworker requested time off, which is a common workplace scenario. The manager's job is to manage staffing and ensure that the team's work is covered. If the coworker took every Monday off without approval, that's a problem. But in this case, the coworker had scheduled it, which might mean they had prior approval or not. The post says \"scheduled,\" which implies the coworker took the initiative to book those days, possibly without the manager's consent. \n\nIf the coworker didn't check with their manager first, that's a breach of protocol. However, if the coworker had already scheduled the time off with the manager's approval, then the manager denying it after the fact could be an issue. But the way the post is written, it seems like the coworker scheduled the days off without the manager's agreement. The manager is reacting negatively to the coworker's assumption that it's okay to take every Monday, which is a significant amount of time off. \n\nIn many workplaces, taking extended time off requires approval from the manager to ensure coverage and workflow isn't disrupted. The coworker might have violated company policy by not getting prior approval, and the manager is correcting that. So the manager isn't in the wrong for denying the request if proper procedures weren't followed. \n\nAdditionally, the coworker's request for 3-day weekends every week over the summer would be unusual and potentially disrupt team operations. The manager's response is about enforcing accountability and ensuring the team's needs are met. Therefore, the author is justified in denying the request if the coworker didn't follow the correct process. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
