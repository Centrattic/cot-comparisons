      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a co-worker (who reports to them) took 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO all summer. The author is denying this request and asking if they're the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the work environment. The author is a manager since the co-worker reports to them. The co-worker is taking every Monday off, which would mean they get a long weekend each week. The author is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's okay and is denying the request.\n\nSo, the key points here: The co-worker is asking for a lot of time off. In most workplaces, PTO is typically limited by the company's policy. Taking 14 Mondays in a row is a significant amount of time. The manager is within their rights to deny such a request if it's outside the company's policy or if it affects team operations.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong here because as a manager, they have the authority to make decisions about employee time off, especially if it's excessive or not in line with company policies. The co-worker might be overstepping by requesting so much time off. The manager is correctly questioning the feasibility and appropriateness of the request.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
