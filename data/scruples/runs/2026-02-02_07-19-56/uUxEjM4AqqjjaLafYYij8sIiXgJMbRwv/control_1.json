      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the manager is wrong for denying a co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is asking for 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The manager thinks that's unreasonable because it would mean the co-worker has 3-day weekends all summer.\n\nFirst, the manager's role is to manage resources and ensure the team's work is covered. If an employee requests time off that affects team operations, the manager has the authority to deny it. The key here is the frequency and duration of the PTO. Taking every Monday off for 14 weeks seems excessive. Most companies have PTO policies that limit how much time an employee can take, especially consecutively. Even if the employee has enough accrued time, the manager can override based on operational needs.\n\nThe question is about right or wrong. The manager isn't being unreasonable here. They're questioning the co-worker's assumption that taking so much time off is acceptable. The manager's response is valid because they have to consider team coverage, workload distribution, and possibly the impact on other employees who might have to cover for the absent colleague. There's no indication the manager is being unfair or petty. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
