      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is someone who reports to the author, so the author is in a managerial position.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and the co-worker requested it according to the policy, the author might need a valid reason to deny it. But if the co-worker didn't follow proper procedures, maybe the author is justified.\n\nThe co-worker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off. That's a lot of time off. If the team relies on that person's work, their absence could cause issues. The author might be concerned about coverage, workload distribution, or team productivity. Maybe there's a policy that limits consecutive PTO days or requires approval for extended time off. If the co-worker didn't get approval in advance, the author has the right to deny the request.\n\nAlso, the author is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's okay, which suggests there's no established policy allowing such long-term PTO without prior arrangement. The author's role is to ensure the team functions smoothly. Allowing someone to take every Monday off might disrupt the workflow, especially if others don't have similar arrangements. The author isn't being unreasonable here; they're maintaining team standards and ensuring work gets done.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. From the information given, the author acted within their authority as a manager. Unless there's a specific policy that the author violated, their decision to deny the request seems appropriate. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
