      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying a co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The person in question is a guy who reports to them, and they scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused about why the employee thought that was okay and is denying the request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a manager or supervisor since the employee reports to them. The employee is asking for a significant amount of time off\u2014every Monday for the entire summer. That's a lot. Taking 14 Mondays would mean that the employee is off every single Monday from May to August or September, depending on the region's summer months. That's like 14 days off in a row if you count the Mondays, but spread out weekly over the summer. However, 14 Mondays in a row would actually span more than a few months. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, the user says 14 consecutive Mondays. Wait, consecutive Mondays would mean 14 weeks in a row where each week starts on a Monday. But that's not possible because there are only 52 weeks in a year. But maybe the employee is asking for every Monday off, not consecutive Mondays. Wait, the original statement says \"14 consecutive Mondays\"\u2014so maybe that's a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe the employee requested to take every Monday off starting from a certain date, resulting in 14 Mondays off. For example, if he starts from the first Monday in May, then every following Monday, which would be 14 Mondays over several weeks. But the user says \"14 consecutive Mondays,\" which might be a mistake. But regardless, the main point is the employee is asking for a lot of time off.\n\nAs a manager, the author has the authority to approve or deny PTO requests. The employee needs to have their time off approved, and it's up to the manager to decide based on team needs, workload, coverage, and company policies. If the employee requested every Monday off, that could create scheduling issues. If the team is short-staffed, or if there are projects that need coverage on Mondays, then denying the request makes sense. The employee might not have considered how their time off affects the team. The author is not in the wrong for denying the request because they are responsible for the team's operations. The employee might be in the wrong for assuming it's okay to take that much time without considering the impact. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
