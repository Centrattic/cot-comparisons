      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is someone who reports to the author, so they're in a supervisory role.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay and is denying the request. The coworker might be trying to have three-day weekends every week during the summer.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's break it down. As a manager, the author has the responsibility to ensure that work gets done and that the team's needs are met. If the coworker is requesting a large block of time off, especially every week for two months, the manager has the authority to deny that if it's not feasible. Employees typically aren't allowed to take time off without approval, and the manager is the one who approves or denies such requests.\n\nHowever, there might be company policies regarding PTO. If the coworker has enough accrued time and the request doesn't interfere with work, the manager might have to approve it. But in this case, the coworker is asking for every Monday off, which could be problematic. If the team needs coverage on Mondays, or if the coworker's role is critical and can't be left without notice, the manager's denial is justified.\n\nAnother angle: the coworker might be abusing PTO by taking it for personal reasons. As the manager, the author has the right to say no if the request isn't in the best interest of the team. The coworker could have discussed this with the manager earlier to get approval, but instead, they scheduled it on their own, which might be a mistake.\n\nThe user says they think the author is wrong, but maybe they're assuming that employees can take time off whenever they want. However, in reality, PTO requires approval, and the manager's job is to balance employee needs with business needs. So the author isn't in the wrong here for denying an unreasonable or potentially disruptive request.\n\nAlso, the coworker didn't check with the manager first. If they wanted to take that much time, they should have discussed it and maybe found a compromise. The manager's role is to ensure that work isn't neglected, so denying the request is the right call.\n"
