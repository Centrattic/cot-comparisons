      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The situation is that a guy who reports to them scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay and is confused about taking 3-day weekends every week. They end up denying the request.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break this down.\n\nThe key points here are about company policy, the employee's rights, and the manager's responsibility. The employee is asking for a lot of time off\u2014every Monday for 14 weeks. That's a significant amount of time. If the company's PTO policy allows for that, then the employee might be within their rights. But if not, the manager has the authority to deny it. \n\nThe manager is responsible for ensuring that the team's workload is covered. If the employee taking Mondays off would disrupt operations, the manager has a duty to say no, even if the policy technically allows it. So, the manager isn't necessarily wrong for denying the request if it affects team performance or if the company policy doesn't support such an extended absence.\n\nAdditionally, the employee's reasoning isn't clear. The coworker might need the time off for personal reasons, but the manager has a duty to maintain team productivity. The manager isn't obligated to approve unscheduled or excessive time off unless it's in line with company policy. \n\nSince the manager is in a position of authority and has a responsibility to manage resources and workload, denying a request that could impact the team's ability to function is a valid managerial decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
