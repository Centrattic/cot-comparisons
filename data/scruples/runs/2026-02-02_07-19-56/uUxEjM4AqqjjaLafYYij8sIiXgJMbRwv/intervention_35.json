      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying a co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The author is a manager since the co-worker reports to them. The employee is asking for time off every Monday during the summer. That's a lot of days off, especially all in a row. The author is questioning why the employee thinks that's acceptable and is denying the request.\n\nIn a typical work environment, employees usually need to request time off, and managers have the authority to approve or deny based on business needs. Taking every Monday off for 14 weeks is a significant amount of time. Even if the employee has earned it through their PTO balance, the manager might have operational reasons to deny it, like coverage, team workload, or project deadlines.\n\nThe key points here are: the manager's authority, the reasonableness of the request, and whether the denial was justified. If the employee had the right to use their PTO as they wish, the manager might not be able to deny it. But if the manager can demonstrate that the time off would disrupt operations or if the employee isn't allowed to take that much time off consecutively, then the denial makes sense.\n\nSince the employee scheduled all the Mondays without approval and the manager is denying it, the manager is likely within their rights to do so. The employee might be in the wrong for requesting such a long stretch of time off without considering the team's needs. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
