      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the manager (AITA) is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker, who reports to the manager, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The manager is confused and thinks that's not acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and the employee is using it properly within the guidelines, then the manager might be wrong to deny it. But if there's a policy against consecutive days off without prior approval, or if the employee didn't follow the correct process, then the manager is justified.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the employee follow the proper procedure for requesting PTO? If he just scheduled it without approval, that's a problem. 2) Are there any company policies that restrict taking multiple Mondays off, especially during a busy season like summer? 3) Is there a team impact? If the team can't function without that person on Mondays, the manager has a valid reason to deny.\n\nThe employee might be assuming it's okay because he's using PTO, but if the manager didn't approve it, then it's a misuse. Also, 14 Mondays in a row is a lot. Maybe the manager has a valid reason for not approving such an extended period. So, the manager isn't necessarily wrong if the employee didn't get prior approval or if it affects team operations. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
