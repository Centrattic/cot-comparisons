      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer.\n\nFirst, the co-worker in question reports to the author, meaning the author is their manager. The co-worker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused and denying the request, saying \"No, sir,\" implying they won't allow it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the co-worker is asking for a long-term, recurring PTO (every Monday), the manager is not approving it. The co-worker might be thinking they can take those days off without permission, but since they report to the author, the manager has the authority to approve or deny PTO requests based on team needs, workload, and company policies.\n\nThe co-worker's assumption that it's okay to take those days off without approval is the issue. The manager isn't in the wrong for denying the request because it's their responsibility to manage the team's schedule and ensure that the workload is covered. The co-worker needs approval for PTO, and the manager isn't obligated to grant time off if it's not feasible for the team or business. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The co-worker is possibly overstepping by assuming they can take those days without proper approval. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
