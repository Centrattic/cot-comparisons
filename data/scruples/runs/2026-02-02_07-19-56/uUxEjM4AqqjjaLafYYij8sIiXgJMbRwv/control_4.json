      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a coworker asking to take every Monday off all summer as PTO. The author, who is a manager since the coworker reports to them, is asking if they're in the wrong for denying the request. The question is whether the author did the right thing by saying no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and there's no policy against taking multiple Mondays off, then the coworker might be within his rights. However, if there's a policy that limits consecutive days off or requires coverage, then the manager has a responsibility to enforce that.\n\nThe coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off. That's a lot of time. If the team can't function without him, that's a problem. The manager's job is to ensure the team's work gets done, so if this absence would create issues, denying the request makes sense. Also, if others aren't getting similar perks, there might be fairness concerns. But the author didn't mention other employees getting the same, so maybe it's a one-off case.\n\nAnother angle: the coworker's reasoning for taking those days. If he's using all his PTO at once, maybe the manager's company has rules about how much PTO can be used consecutively. If not, then the manager might be overstepping by denying it, but if there's a valid operational reason, then it's justified.\n\nI think the key here is the manager's duty to maintain team functionality. Without knowing specific policies, it's likely that the manager isn't in the wrong because they need to prevent potential disruptions. Also, the coworker might not have considered the team's needs when scheduling so much time. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
