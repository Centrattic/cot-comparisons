      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off during the summer. The co-worker, who reports to them, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and the employee is within their limits, maybe the manager's denial is unwarranted. But if the co-worker didn't follow proper procedures\u2014like not getting approval before scheduling the time off\u2014the manager has a right to say no. The co-worker's request for every Monday could disrupt team operations, especially if others are working those days. The manager might need employees to be present for coverage or to maintain workflow. \n\nAlso, the tone of the original post seems frustrated. The author is confused why the co-worker thinks this is okay, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding about the PTO policy. If the co-worker didn't follow the right process, the manager is justified in denying. But if the policy allows for such requests and the co-worker followed it, then maybe the manager is overstepping. \n\nAnother angle: the co-worker reporting to the author might have a direct impact on their workload. If the co-worker's absence affects team performance, the manager has a duty to prevent that. So, the manager isn't in the wrong for ensuring the team functions properly. \n\nI think the key points are whether the co-worker followed the correct procedures and if their absence would hinder the team. If both are true, the manager is in the right. So the answer is B.\n"
