      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker, who reports to them, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused why the coworker thinks that's okay and is denying the request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the coworker was following the proper PTO procedures, then the author might have grounds to deny if it's not feasible. However, if the coworker didn't follow the right steps, the author should address that. The problem is the coworker scheduled 14 Mondays off, which is a lot. The author is questioning the coworker's logic since it would mean three-day weekends every week. \n\nThe key points here are: Does the company allow such PTO requests? If the coworker submitted this as a PTO request, the author, as a manager, has the authority to approve or deny based on operational needs. Taking every Monday off could be disruptive, especially if the coworker's role is critical and there's no coverage. The author isn't wrong for denying if they can't manage the team with that person off every Monday. \n\nAlso, the coworker might have misunderstood or misapplied the PTO policy. The author's confusion is valid because 14 Mondays is a significant amount of time. Unless the policy explicitly allows such requests, the author isn't in the wrong for rejecting it. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
