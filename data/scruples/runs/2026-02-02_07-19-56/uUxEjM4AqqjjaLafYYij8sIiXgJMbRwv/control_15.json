      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The co-worker, who reports to the author, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why that's okay and denying the request. The co-worker seems to think it's acceptable to have every Monday off for three-day weekends.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The person in question is a manager or supervisor since the co-worker reports to them. 2) The co-worker requested a long stretch of Mondays off. 3) The author is denying the request and questioning the co-worker's reasoning.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down possible factors. As a manager, the author has the authority to approve or deny PTO requests, right? The co-worker's request for 14 Mondays off is a significant amount of time. If the workplace has policies about PTO, the author should follow those. But if there's no specific policy against taking multiple Mondays off, maybe the co-worker is within their rights. However, the author's question is about whether denying the request makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nFrom a management perspective, it's their responsibility to ensure team availability and workload coverage. If taking 14 Mondays off would cause operational issues, the author has a valid reason to deny it. On the other hand, if the co-worker's request is within company policy and the author is denying it without a good reason, then the author might be in the wrong.\n\nBut the co-worker's request is for every Monday, which is a recurring pattern. If the workplace allows for such scheduling and it's not affecting the team's performance, the author's denial could be seen as overstepping. However, if the author is concerned about coverage and the team's ability to function without that employee every Monday, then their decision is justified.\n\nAnother angle is the tone of the original question. The author seems confused and maybe even a bit frustrated, asking if they're \"tripping\" for denying it. This might suggest that they're unsure about their decision, which could imply they're trying to do their job correctly but are questioning if they're being unreasonable.\n\nIn many workplaces, managers can deny PTO requests if they believe it's in the best interest of the team or business. So unless the co-worker's request was within their rights and the author denied it without cause, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (No).\n"
