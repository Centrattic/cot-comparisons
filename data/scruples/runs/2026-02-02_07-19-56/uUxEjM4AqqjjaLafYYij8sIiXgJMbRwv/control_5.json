      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker asking to take every Monday off all summer, and the author (who is their manager) denying that request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company has a PTO policy that allows employees to take time off, but the manager has the authority to approve or deny based on team needs, then the manager might be justified. The coworker is taking 14 Mondays, which is a lot. If the team needs coverage on those Mondays, the manager can't just let someone take all those days off. Especially if it's a critical role, the manager has to ensure that operations aren't disrupted.\n\nBut maybe the coworker didn't check with the manager before scheduling. If the manager didn't set clear expectations about PTO requests and the coworker assumed it was okay, then the coworker might be at fault. However, if the manager's role includes approving PTO and the coworker followed the correct procedure, the manager still has the right to deny if it's not feasible.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"all summer YOU will have 3-day weekends?\" suggests the coworker isn't considering the manager's perspective. The manager is responsible for the team's performance, so denying the request to maintain team functionality is reasonable. The manager isn't being unreasonable here; they're ensuring that work gets done. The coworker might be overstepping by requesting such an extended period without considering the team's needs.\n\nIn most workplaces, managers have the discretion to approve or deny PTO based on operational requirements. So, the manager isn't in the wrong for denying the request if there's a valid business reason. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
