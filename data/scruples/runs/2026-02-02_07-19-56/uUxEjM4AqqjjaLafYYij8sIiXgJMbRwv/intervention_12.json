      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a coworker taking every Monday off all summer, and the author (AITA) is denying that request. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If there's a policy allowing PTO, then the coworker might be within his rights. But if the coworker scheduled all Mondays without approval, maybe the author has the authority to deny it. The author is a manager since the coworker reports to them. So, the author's role is to manage the team's schedule and ensure coverage.\n\nThe coworker's request for 14 Mondays off could affect the team's workflow. If the author denied it to maintain team balance and ensure no one is overburdened, that makes sense. However, if the coworker followed the proper PTO procedures and the author's denial is without valid reason, that could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the tone of the question is a bit confrontational. The author seems confused why the coworker thinks it's okay. Maybe the coworker didn't communicate well or there was a misunderstanding. The key here is whether the author has a legitimate reason to deny the request based on business needs, team coverage, or policy violations.\n\nIf the coworker scheduled all Mondays without considering the team's needs or the author's approval, the author is justified in denying. But if the coworker had planned this in advance and the author is being inflexible without cause, the author might be wrong. Since the author is the manager, their decision is usually final unless it's arbitrary or discriminatory. Without more context, it's likely the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
