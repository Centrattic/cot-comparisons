      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is a guy who reports to them and scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused and thinks it's not okay for the coworker to have three-day weekends all summer. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical policies around PTO. Most companies have a PTO policy that outlines how much time employees can take, the process for requesting it, and any restrictions. If the coworker requested 14 Mondays, that's a lot of time off. But the key here is whether the coworker followed the proper procedures and if the team can handle the workload without him.\n\nIf the coworker followed the correct procedure, like submitting the request in advance and getting approval, then the author, as a manager, has a responsibility to consider the team's needs. However, if the coworker didn't follow the process or if the team can't handle his absence, the manager has the authority to deny the request. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's 14 Mondays in a row might affect team operations. If the coworker is part of a team that needs consistent coverage, having someone off every Monday could disrupt workflow. The manager's role is to ensure that the team meets its goals and that there's enough coverage. So, if the coworker's absence would create a problem, the manager is justified in saying no.\n\nOn the other hand, if the company's PTO policy allows for such requests and the coworker has the available time, the manager might need to consider alternatives, like splitting the time or finding a replacement. But if the manager has a valid reason based on workload or team needs, denying the request is appropriate.\n\nThe author's confusion (\"Am I tripping?\") suggests they might not have considered the coworker's policies or the process. However, as a manager, they have the discretion to make decisions based on the team's best interests. So, unless the coworker's request was within policy and the manager denied it without a valid reason, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong if they denied the request because it would negatively impact the team, and they are following their managerial responsibilities. The coworker might have made a poor request, but the manager's role is to ensure team success. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
