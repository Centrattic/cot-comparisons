      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is their subordinate since they report to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. Usually, PTO is a set amount each year, right? If the co-worker took 14 Mondays off, that's a lot. Let's calculate. Summer is roughly three months, so around 12 weeks. If they took a Monday each week, that's 12 days. But the user mentioned 14 Mondays. Maybe they're including some specific dates or overlapping with holidays? Either way, 14 days off for PTO in a row might exceed the annual allowance. Companies often have limits on consecutive days off, so taking 14 days straight might not be allowed unless it's an extended leave.\n\nAlso, the user is the co-worker's manager. As a manager, they have the authority to approve or deny PTO requests based on team needs and policies. If the co-worker didn't get approval in advance, the manager is within their rights to deny it. Plus, taking every Monday off would mean the co-worker has 3-day weekends, but that might disrupt team workflow, especially if the manager's team needs coverage those days.\n\nAnother angle: the manager might have a legitimate reason to say no. The co-worker should have checked with their manager before scheduling such a long period off. If the co-worker didn't communicate properly, the manager isn't wrong for denying. The manager isn't being unreasonable here; they're enforcing policies and ensuring the team doesn't get disrupted.\n\nBut wait, could there be a misunderstanding? Maybe the co-worker thought it was okay because they've done it before or the policy allows it. However, the manager's role is to interpret the policy correctly. If the 14 Mondays exceed the allowed days, the manager is right to object. Also, the manager is questioning why the co-worker thinks it's okay, which shows they're trying to understand the request's validity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the manager isn't in the wrong. They're upholding company policy and ensuring their team functions properly. The co-worker should have consulted first, and the manager is just doing their job by denying an unreasonable request.\n"
