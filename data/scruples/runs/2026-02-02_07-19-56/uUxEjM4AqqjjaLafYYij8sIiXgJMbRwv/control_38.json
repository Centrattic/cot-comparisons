      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker who reports to them scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused about why the co-worker thinks that's okay and is denying the request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. Typically, PTO is given for personal use, but there are usually limits. Taking every Monday off for 14 weeks seems excessive. Most companies have a cap on consecutive PTO days or require approval for extended leave. If the co-worker didn't follow proper procedures, the author is right to deny it.\n\nAlso, the co-worker's position: if the co-worker reports to the author, then the author has a responsibility to ensure that the team's work is covered. Allowing such a long stretch of Mondays off could disrupt workflow, especially if the team is short-staffed or if the co-worker's role is critical. The author might need to consider how this affects the team's productivity and other employees.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness of the request. Taking every Monday all summer could set a bad precedent. Other employees might request similar time off, leading to scheduling conflicts. The author's denial is to maintain fairness and operational efficiency.\n\nHowever, if the company's PTO policy allows for such requests and the co-worker followed the proper steps, then the author might be overstepping. But given the description, the co-worker seems to have scheduled without approval, which is a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They are within their rights to deny an unreasonable or improperly requested PTO that could harm the team. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
