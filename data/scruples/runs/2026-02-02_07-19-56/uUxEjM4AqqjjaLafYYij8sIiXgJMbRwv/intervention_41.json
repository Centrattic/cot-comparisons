      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for denying a co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is someone who reports to the author, so the author is their manager.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO, then taking time off is usually up to the manager's approval. The co-worker asked for 14 consecutive Mondays off. That seems a lot. Taking every Monday off during the summer would result in 3-day weekends, which might not be feasible if the team needs coverage. \n\nThe author is questioning the co-worker's request, which is their responsibility as a manager. Denying the request isn't necessarily being in the wrong if the manager deems it unreasonable. But maybe the co-worker had a valid reason, like family obligations. However, the author's job is to ensure the team's work gets done. If the co-worker can't be replaced, denying the leave makes sense. \n\nOn the other hand, if the company's PTO policy allows for such requests, the author might need to consider that. But the author is the one in charge, so they have the authority to say no if they think it's against the team's best interest. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're fulfilling their managerial role by ensuring the team's needs are met. The co-worker might be in the wrong for assuming it's okay without discussing the impact. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
