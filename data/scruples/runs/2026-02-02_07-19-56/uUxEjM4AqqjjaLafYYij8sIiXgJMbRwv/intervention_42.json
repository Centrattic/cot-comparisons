      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off during the summer. The coworker, who reports to them, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. PTO policies vary, and some companies allow employees to schedule time off, but there might be limits. If the coworker took 14 Mondays in a row, that's a lot of time off. The author is the manager here, so they have a responsibility to ensure the team's workload is covered and that operations run smoothly. If the coworker is taking off every Monday, that could create scheduling gaps, especially if the team isn't adequately staffed for those days. \n\nThe coworker might have thought it was okay, but the manager's role is to say no if it's not feasible. The author points out that the coworker's request would mean having 3-day weekends all summer, which might not be sustainable for the team. The author isn't wrong to question this because it's their job to manage resources and ensure that the team can handle the workload. \n\nOn the other hand, if the coworker had valid reasons and the team could manage without them, then maybe there's a different angle. But the key here is that the author is denying the request, which is a management decision. Unless there's a specific policy that allows for such extended PTO, the author isn't in the wrong for upholding company standards. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They're doing their job by ensuring the team isn't overburdened and that the coworker's request is feasible. The coworker might have assumed it's okay, but the manager's role is to assess and make decisions based on the team's needs.\n"
