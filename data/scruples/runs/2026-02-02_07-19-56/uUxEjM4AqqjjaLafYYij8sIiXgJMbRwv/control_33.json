      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a co-worker who reports to them requested every Monday off for the entire summer, which is 14 consecutive Mondays. The author is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's okay and says they're denying the request.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about PTO (Personal Time Off) policies and workplace management. The co-worker is asking for a lot of time off\u2014every Monday for 14 weeks. That seems like a significant amount. Normally, PTO is for personal use, but there are limits based on company policy, job requirements, and team needs.\n\nThe author is their supervisor, so they have the authority to approve or deny PTO requests. If the company policy allows for such time off and the co-worker has enough accrued days, then maybe the request is valid. But if taking every Monday off would disrupt work, the author has a responsibility to ensure that the team's work isn't affected. Maybe the co-worker's role requires them to be available every Monday, or perhaps there's a team workload that needs coverage. In that case, denying the request makes sense.\n\nAnother angle is fairness. If other employees can take time off as needed, but this co-worker is asking for an extended period, the author might need to consider equity. However, if the company policy is flexible, the co-worker might be within their rights. But the author's job is to manage the team effectively, so they have to balance the employee's needs with the team's responsibilities.\n\nThe co-worker's request for 14 Mondays is quite specific. Maybe there's a pattern where the co-worker is trying to maximize their 3-day weekends, which could be possible if their job allows. However, from a management perspective, approving such a long and recurring absence might not be feasible. The author isn't wrong for questioning the request and denying it if it's impractical or against company policy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They are fulfilling their role as a supervisor by ensuring that team operations aren't disrupted. The answer should be B (No).\n"
