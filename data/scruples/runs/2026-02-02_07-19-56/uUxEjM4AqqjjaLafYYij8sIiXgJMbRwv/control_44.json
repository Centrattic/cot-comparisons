      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The writer is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay and is confused about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the company's PTO policies. If the company allows such requests and the coworker used their allotted time correctly, then maybe the writer is overstepping by denying it. But if the coworker's request is unreasonable or violates company policy, the writer's denial makes sense. \n\nThe coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer sounds like a pattern that might affect team operations. If the team needs coverage on Mondays or if this creates scheduling issues, then the writer, as a manager, has a duty to ensure the team functions properly. Allowing someone to take every Monday off could lead to coverage gaps or place more workload on other team members.\n\nAlso, the writer is the coworker's supervisor since they mention \"reports to me.\" So as a manager, it's their responsibility to manage PTO requests to maintain workflow and team balance. Denying an excessive or impractical request isn't necessarily wrong. The coworker might have thought it was okay without considering the impact on the team or the approval process. \n\nThe key factors here are whether the coworker followed the proper procedure for requesting PTO, if the company's policy allows for such a long block of time, and if the writer's denial was based on valid operational reasons. If the policy allows it and the coworker applied correctly, the writer might be in the wrong for denying it without explanation. But if the request would disrupt the team, the writer's refusal is justified. Since the scenario doesn't mention policy specifics, but the writer is the manager, it's more likely that the denial is appropriate. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
