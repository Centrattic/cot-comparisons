      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is someone who reports to them, so they have authority over their schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO requests as long as they don't disrupt operations, then the coworker's request might be within policy. But if the coworker is taking an excessive amount of time off, maybe the manager has a right to deny it. The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off. That's 14 Mondays in a row, which sounds like every Monday all summer. Depending on how long summer is, that could be a lot of days. For example, summer in the Northern Hemisphere is June, July, August, which has around 13 weeks, so 13 Mondays. Taking all of them off seems excessive unless there's a valid reason.\n\nThe author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay. Maybe the coworker didn't check with their manager first, assuming they could just schedule off days. But as a manager, it's the author's responsibility to ensure that team workload is manageable and that coverage is maintained. If taking every Monday off would cause issues, like not having enough staff that day, then denying the request is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the coworker might be using all their PTO at once, which could be against company policy. Some companies require advance notice and have limits on consecutive days off. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing those policies. The coworker might be overstepping by taking so much time without considering the impact on the team or the department's operations. \n\nAnother angle: the coworker reports to the author, so the author has the authority to approve or deny PTO. If the coworker didn't get approval and just scheduled the days off, the author's denial is appropriate. The coworker might have expected it to be okay, but the manager has the final say. The author is just doing their job by ensuring that PTO requests are managed responsibly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The coworker made an unreasonable request that the manager has the right to deny. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
