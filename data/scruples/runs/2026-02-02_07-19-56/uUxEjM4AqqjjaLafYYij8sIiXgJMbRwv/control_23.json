      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is scheduled to report to the author, so the author is in a supervisory role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If there's a policy that allows employees to schedule PTO, then the co-worker might be within his rights. But if there's a policy against consecutive days off or if the author's approval is required, then the co-worker might have overstepped. However, the question is about the author's actions. Denying the request might be justified if there's a business need or if the PTO was not properly approved. \n\nThe co-worker took 14 consecutive Mondays, which is every Monday for the entire summer. That's a lot of time off. If the author didn't approve it, maybe the co-worker violated company policy by scheduling it without permission. But the author is the one who is denying it now. The key is whether the co-worker had prior approval. If not, then the author is right to deny. If the co-worker did have approval, then the author's denial might be problematic. \n\nThe question doesn't mention prior approval. The author says the co-worker \"scheduled\" the days off, which might imply he did it without approval. In that case, the author has the authority to deny it. The author isn't wrong for denying an unauthorized request. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the responsibility to manage their team's availability and ensure work is covered. Approving all Mondays might disrupt team operations, especially if other colleagues are working Mondays. The author is upholding their role by enforcing proper PTO procedures.\n"
