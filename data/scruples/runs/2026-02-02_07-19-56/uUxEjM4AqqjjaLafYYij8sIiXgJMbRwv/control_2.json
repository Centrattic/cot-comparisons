      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is someone who reports to them, so they have authority over their PTO.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. Most companies have PTO policies that specify how much time an employee can take and any restrictions, like minimum notice periods or limits on consecutive days. If the coworker scheduled 14 Mondays off, that's a lot. Even if each Monday is a separate PTO day, taking every Monday might not be allowed if it's more than the allotted PTO or if it conflicts with team needs.\n\nAlso, the manager's role is to ensure the team can function smoothly. If the coworker is taking every Monday, that could create scheduling issues, especially if there's a team that needs coverage or if it affects project timelines. The manager's job is to balance employee needs with business requirements.\n\nThe coworker might think it's okay if they have enough PTO accrued, but even then, managers can have discretion to deny requests if they negatively impact the team. The key factors here are the company's PTO policy and the business impact. Since the user is the manager, they have the authority to approve or deny PTO requests, so denying this request doesn't seem wrong. Unless there's a policy that allows such a schedule, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
