      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is someone who reports to them, so they have some authority here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company has a policy that allows for PTO requests as long as they're approved, then the co-worker might have followed that. However, if the policy requires approval and the manager didn't know about it beforehand, maybe the co-worker acted without permission. The original post mentions the co-worker scheduled 14 Mondays off, which is every Monday for the entire summer. That seems excessive. Managing a team, having someone off every Monday could disrupt workflow, especially if others are working. \n\nAlso, the manager's role is to ensure the team's productivity. If the co-worker took time off without approval, the manager is justified in denying it. The phrase \"scheduled\" might mean the co-worker already booked the time, but if the manager wasn't informed, that's a problem. The manager isn't in the wrong for enforcing rules here. So the answer is B.\n"
