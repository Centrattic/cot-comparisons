      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the manager (the author) is in the wrong for denying a co-worker's request to take every Monday off during the summer. The co-worker, who reports to the manager, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The manager is confused about why the co-worker thinks that's acceptable and is denying the request.\n\nFirst, the manager has the authority to approve or deny PTO requests, especially since the co-worker reports to them. The key points here are the company's PTO policy and the reasonableness of the request. If the company allows unlimited PTO or if there's a policy that permits such extended time off, the manager might need to consider that. However, 14 consecutive Mondays is an unusual pattern. It's possible that the manager is concerned about coverage, team workload, or the precedent this might set. \n\nThe co-worker's request for every Monday off could disrupt team operations, especially if others don't have similar requests. The manager's role is to ensure the team functions smoothly, so denying an unreasonable request isn't necessarily wrong. Unless the company policy specifically allows for such extended time off, the manager is justified in denying it. There's no mention of the co-worker having a valid reason (like medical or family emergency), so it's likely a personal preference. Therefore, the manager isn't in the wrong for upholding their decision.\n"
