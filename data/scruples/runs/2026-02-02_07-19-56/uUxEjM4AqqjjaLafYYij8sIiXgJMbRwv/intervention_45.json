      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a co-worker, who reports to the author, has scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. The author is denying this request and asking if they're the a**hole (AITA). The user is saying they think the author is in the wrong but want to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO, then the co-worker might be using it as per the policy. However, if the co-worker is using up all their PTO for the summer, maybe there's a problem. But the author is their manager, so they have the authority to approve or deny PTO requests, right?\n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is denying the request. If the co-worker has already scheduled 14 Mondays, maybe that's more than the allowed PTO days. Or maybe not. If the company's policy allows for such a request, then the author might be overstepping by denying it. But if the co-worker is using all Mondays, that could create scheduling issues. For example, if the author's team needs coverage on Mondays, then denying the request makes sense. However, the author didn't mention any specific reason why the request is problematic. They just seem to be confused and think it's not okay. \n\nAnother angle: if the co-worker is in a position where they can take that time off without affecting the team's workload, then the author shouldn't interfere. But if the author needs the team to be present on Mondays for meetings or to cover shifts, then the request is unreasonable. The author's response of \"No, sir\" suggests they denied it, but the reasoning isn't clear. Maybe the author didn't consider if the co-worker had the right to use their PTO as long as it's within the company's guidelines.\n\nAlso, the co-worker is asking for every Monday off all summer. How many Mondays are there in a summer? Let's say summer is about 12-13 weeks. If the co-worker has 14 Mondays off, that's using all their PTO. But if their PTO accrues based on time worked, maybe that's within their limit. The author might be denying it without checking the actual PTO balance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the co-worker is using the same day off repeatedly, which could be an issue if it affects team operations. But the author isn't providing a reason, just expressing confusion. Without more context, it's hard to say. But generally, employees do have the right to use their PTO as they choose, unless it conflicts with work needs. Since the author is the manager, they can deny if there's a legitimate business reason. However, if the co-worker is using their own PTO and not causing issues, the author might be wrong to deny. So, if the author denied without a valid reason, then they are in the wrong. But if the request is unreasonable (like too much time or affecting work), then they aren't. The problem here is the lack of details about company policy and the co-worker's PTO balance. The author's confusion might indicate they didn't check the policy first. So, maybe the author is in the right if the request is outside company policy. But if it's within policy, then the author is wrong. Since the user says they think the author is wrong, but I need to decide based on the info given. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the scenario doesn't state that the co-worker is violating any policy, the author might be wrong to deny. So answer B, No.\n"
