      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker, who reports to the author, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why the coworker thinks this is okay and is surprised by the request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company has a PTO policy that allows employees to schedule time off, then the coworker might be within their rights. However, if there's a policy against scheduling all Mondays off without special circumstances, then the coworker could be in the wrong. But the author's role as a manager is to enforce these policies, so if the policy isn't clear, the manager might need to clarify expectations.\n\nNext, the coworker's request for 14 Mondays of PTO seems excessive. Taking every Monday off would result in significant time off, which could affect team coverage and responsibilities. The manager's job is to ensure that the team can function smoothly even when someone is on PTO. If the coworker's absence would create a problem, the manager has the right to deny the request to maintain operational efficiency.\n\nThe author's reaction shows they're questioning the coworker's judgment. The coworker's reasoning for needing every Monday off isn't provided, so without context, it's hard to assess. However, as a manager, the author isn't obligated to approve requests that could disrupt the team. Denying the request doesn't necessarily make the author wrong unless there's a policy violation or lack of communication.\n\nIn many workplaces, managers have discretion to approve or deny PTO requests based on operational needs. The key points are whether the coworker followed the proper procedure and if the manager's decision aligns with company policies. If the coworker didn't follow the correct process, the manager is justified in denying. If the coworker did follow it, but the manager still denies based on valid operational reasons, the manager is likely in the right.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for denying the request if it's based on sound management practices and company policies.\n"
