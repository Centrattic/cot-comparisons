      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off during the summer. The coworker, who reports to the author, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused about why the coworker thinks this is acceptable and is questioning it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical workplace policies regarding PTO. Generally, employees need approval for time off, and managers have the authority to approve or deny these requests based on team needs and workload. If the coworker scheduled 14 Mondays without prior approval, that's a red flag. The manager's role is to ensure that the team's work is covered, so allowing someone to take off every Monday all summer might disrupt operations.\n\nThe author is in a supervisory role here, so they have the responsibility to manage their team's availability. The coworker's request seems excessive and potentially against company policy if it wasn't approved. The author's reaction of confusion and denial is understandable because allowing that much time off without approval could set a bad precedent and affect team productivity.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the coworker had a valid reason for the PTO. If there's a personal reason, maybe the author should have been more accommodating. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the coworker didn't get prior approval and the author denied the request, the author is acting within their managerial duties. The coworker should have discussed the PTO request beforehand, and the author isn't at fault for denying an unsanctioned absence.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The manager isn't at fault for denying unauthorized time off, especially when it's a significant portion of the summer and could impact the team's workflow.\n"
