      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer.\n\nFirst, the co-worker who reports to them scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why they think that's okay and is denying the request. The co-worker is implying that the author is being unreasonable by saying \"No, sir.\" The author is asking if they're tripping, meaning if they're wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The answer options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nNow, considering workplace norms, typically PTO requests are subject to approval based on business needs. If the co-worker is asking for every Monday off, which is a significant amount of time, the author (as a manager) has the authority to deny it if it impacts team operations. The co-worker's statement \"So all summer YOU will have 3-day weekends?\" seems to imply that the author is being selfish, but the author is actually the one making the decision here.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The co-worker is the subordinate, 2) The author has the authority to manage PTO requests, 3) The co-worker's request is extensive (every Monday for 14 weeks), which could be impractical. The author denying it isn't necessarily in the wrong unless there's a policy they violated. If the company allows such PTO, then maybe the author is wrong. But without specific policy details, the default is that a manager can deny requests they feel are excessive. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
