      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off during the summer. The coworker, who reports to them, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused why the coworker thinks this is okay and questions if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. Typically, PTO allows employees to take time off for personal reasons, but there are usually limits. Taking every Monday might be a problem because it could affect team coverage and workload. If the coworker didn't get approval for all those Mondays, the manager has the authority to deny it, especially if it's not feasible for the team.\n\nAlso, the coworker's request might be seen as excessive. Summer is a busy time for many companies, and having a key team member off every Monday could disrupt operations. The manager's role is to ensure the team functions smoothly, so denying unreasonable time off is part of their job.\n\nThe author's question \"Am I tripping?\" suggests they're unsure if their reaction is justified. But given the scenario, it seems reasonable for a manager to deny such a long and frequent PTO request without proper approval. The coworker should have discussed this with their manager first. So the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
