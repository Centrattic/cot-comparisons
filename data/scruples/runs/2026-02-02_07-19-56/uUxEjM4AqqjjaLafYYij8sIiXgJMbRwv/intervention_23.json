      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off for the summer. The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay and clarifies that the coworker isn't getting three-day weekends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the coworker has the right to take PTO on Mondays, maybe under company policy, the author as a manager might have the authority to approve or deny such requests. But is there a policy that allows for consecutive days off? If the coworker used all their PTO for those Mondays, that's their right. However, if the coworker is requesting time off without proper notice or if it affects team operations, the author might be justified in denying it.\n\nAlso, the coworker taking every Monday off could create scheduling issues. The author, as a manager, has a responsibility to ensure that the team's work is covered. If the coworker's absence would hinder productivity or if other team members don't get the same time off, that could be a problem. But if the coworker is within their rights and the author unreasonably denies it without a valid reason, that could be the author's fault.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the coworker didn't follow the correct procedure for requesting time off. If the author didn't approve the request properly, that's on the author. However, if the coworker scheduled it without approval, then the author is right to deny it. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The coworker might be overusing PTO, but the author has a duty to manage resources effectively. If the author denied it without a clear policy or valid operational reason, that's a problem. But if there's a legitimate reason, like needing coverage, then the author is justified.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it's likely the author is not in the wrong (B) because they have a managerial responsibility to ensure the team functions properly. The coworker's request might not be reasonable if it affects the team, and the author is correct in denying it. However, if the company policy allows for such PTO and the author has no valid operational reason, then the author would be wrong. But the question is about the situation as presented, where the author is questioning why the coworker thinks it's okay, implying there's no policy allowing it. So the author is right to deny it.\n"
