      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is a direct report under the author, so the author is likely a manager or team lead. The coworker requested 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and there's no policy against taking multiple Mondays in a row, then the coworker's request might be legitimate. But the author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay. Maybe there's a policy that limits consecutive days off or requires approval for extended absences. The author, as a manager, has the authority to approve or deny PTO requests based on team needs and operational requirements.\n\nIf the coworker's absence on every Monday would disrupt team operations, the author has a valid reason to deny the request. For example, if the team relies on certain days for critical tasks and the coworker's role is essential on Mondays, then denying the request makes sense. However, if the coworker's role can handle Mondays without them and the company's PTO policy allows such requests, then the author might be overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author's tone seems to be questioning the coworker's assumption, which could indicate that the coworker didn't follow proper procedures. If the coworker didn't check the policy or didn't get approval, the coworker might be in the wrong. But the author's responsibility is to enforce policies and ensure team functionality. Denying a PTO request that could impact work is within the author's role.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if other team members can take similar time off without issue, the author might be singling out this coworker, which could be problematic. But if there's a valid reason specific to the coworker's role or the team's workload, then it's justified.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for denying the request if it's based on company policy and team needs. They have the authority and responsibility to manage PTO requests in a way that maintains operational efficiency. The coworker might be in the wrong for not understanding or following the proper procedures. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
