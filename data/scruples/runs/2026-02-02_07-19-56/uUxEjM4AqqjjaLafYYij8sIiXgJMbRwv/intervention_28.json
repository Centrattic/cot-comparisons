The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay and denies it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the coworker had the right to schedule PTO without approval, then maybe the author didn't need to deny it. But if the coworker needed approval and didn't get it, then the author is justified. Also, taking every Monday off for three months might affect team operations. The author, being a manager, has a responsibility to ensure coverage. If the coworker didn't check with the author first, the author is right to deny. On the other hand, if the coworker followed proper procedures, maybe the author should approve. But the post says the coworker is \"scheduled\" without permission, so the author is correct to deny. So the answer is B.\n"
