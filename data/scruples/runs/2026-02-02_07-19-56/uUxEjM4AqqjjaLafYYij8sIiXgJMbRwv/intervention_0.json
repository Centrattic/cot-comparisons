      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is saying no, and the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policy. If the coworker didn't follow the proper procedure for requesting PTO, like submitting it in advance or getting approval, then the author is justified in denying it. PTO is usually at the discretion of the employer, so the manager can decide based on team needs.\n\nNext, the coworker's request for 14 Mondays sounds excessive. Taking every Monday off for three months would mean being away every week. That could disrupt team operations, especially if the coworker's responsibilities aren't covered. The manager has a duty to ensure the team can function without key members missing.\n\nAlso, the coworker's reasoning isn't clear. The post mentions the coworker \"schedules\" the time off, which might imply they did it without approval. If the company requires prior approval for PTO, then the coworker acted improperly. The manager is right to question why they think it's okay.\n\nOn the other hand, if the coworker followed all the rules and the manager is being unreasonable, then the author might be at fault. But the way the situation is presented suggests the coworker overstepped. The author is a manager, so they have authority to deny requests that don't align with operational needs.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they are upholding company policy and ensuring team continuity. The coworker likely didn't follow proper procedures, and the request is impractical.\n"
