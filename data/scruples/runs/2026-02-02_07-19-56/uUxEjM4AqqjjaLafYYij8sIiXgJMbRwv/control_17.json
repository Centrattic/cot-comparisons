      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is someone who reports to them, so they're a manager or a supervisor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The manager is questioning why the coworker thinks that's acceptable and denies the request. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, the key points here: the coworker is asking for a lot of time off\u2014every Monday for 14 weeks. That's a significant amount. As a manager, it's part of their role to approve or deny PTO requests based on team needs, workload, and company policies. \n\nIf the coworker hasn't communicated the need for this time off properly, or if the manager has a policy against such long stretches of time off, then the manager is within their rights to deny. Also, having 3-day weekends every week could affect team coverage, especially if the coworker's role is critical. The manager might need that person present for meetings, client interactions, or other responsibilities on Mondays.\n\nOn the other hand, if the coworker has already scheduled the time off and the manager is now objecting, maybe there was a misunderstanding. But the user is asking if the manager is wrong for denying. The coworker asked to take time off, and the manager has the authority to say no. Unless there's a company policy that allows for such requests, the manager isn't in the wrong here. \n\nI should also consider if there are any other factors, like the coworker's past behavior. If they've consistently taken time off without issues, maybe the manager is being unreasonable. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The manager seems to be questioning the coworker's judgment in requesting so much time off, which could be a valid concern. \n\nIn most workplace scenarios, managers have the discretion to manage their team's availability. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're doing their job by ensuring the team can function and that PTO is used appropriately.\n"
