      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for denying a co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer.\n\nFirst, the co-worker is asking for 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. That's a lot of time off. The author, who is a manager since the co-worker reports to them, is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's acceptable. They're denying the request, which is their role in managing the team's workload and ensuring coverage.\n\nNow, the key points here are: \n1. The co-worker has the authority to request time off, but the manager has the final say on approving it.\n2. Taking every Monday off all summer would mean the co-worker has three-day weekends, which might be acceptable if the workload allows and there's proper coverage. However, if that's not feasible, the manager is right to deny it.\n3. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now seeking opinions. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're unsure.\n\nI need to consider if denying the request is within the manager's rights. Typically, managers can deny PTO requests if it's against company policy, if there's a workload issue, or if it affects team operations. Since the co-worker is asking for a long period of consecutive days off, the manager might have valid reasons to deny it. \n\nThe user's initial stance is that the author is in the wrong, but the manager's role here is to manage the team effectively. If the co-worker's request would disrupt the team or isn't feasible, the manager isn't in the wrong for denying it. The author isn't necessarily being unreasonable unless there's a company policy that allows for such time off without restriction. Without that, the author is doing their job by ensuring the team can function without key members being absent.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
