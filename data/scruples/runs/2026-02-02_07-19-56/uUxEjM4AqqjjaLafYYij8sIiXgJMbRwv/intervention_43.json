      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is someone who reports to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay and denying the request. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now seeking confirmation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the coworker is asking for a significant amount of time off\u2014every Monday for 14 weeks. That's a lot. Most companies have PTO policies that specify how much time employees can take. If the coworker is asking for something beyond the allowed PTO, the author as a manager can deny it. Also, taking every Monday off would mean the coworker has 3-day weekends, which might be seen as unfair, especially if others don't have that luxury. Plus, the coworker's role might require them to be present, especially if their absence would impact the team or operations.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the coworker has a valid reason, like a personal commitment or medical issue, and the author is being inflexible. But the way the post is written, the author seems confused and thinks the coworker's request is unreasonable. The coworker didn't explain the reasoning, so the author is reacting based on the request itself.\n\nIn most workplaces, managers have the authority to approve or deny PTO requests based on team needs and policies. If the coworker's request isn't in line with company policy, the author isn't wrong to deny it. Also, taking all Mondays off might cause scheduling issues, especially if the coworker's responsibilities are critical and can't be covered by others. The author isn't being unreasonable by saying \"no\" in this case. The coworker should have checked the PTO policy first before making such a request. Therefore, the author is justified in their decision.\n"
