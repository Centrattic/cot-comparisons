      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker, who reports to the author, scheduled 14 Mondays as PTO. The author is confused and thinks this isn't acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. Typically, PTO is given for personal reasons, but there are usually limits. If the coworker is taking all Mondays off, that's a lot of consecutive days. Depending on the company's PTO policy, this might exceed allowed time off. The author, as a manager, has a responsibility to ensure that work is covered and that employees aren't abusing their time off.\n\nNext, the coworker's request could disrupt the team's workflow. If the coworker is in a role that's critical, having them off every Monday could affect operations. The author might be right to deny it if it's causing scheduling issues. Also, fairness comes into play. Are other employees allowed similar time off? If this is an exception made for one person, it could create resentment.\n\nThe coworker's reasoning isn't provided here. Maybe they have a valid reason, but the author didn't mention that. However, the coworker scheduled 14 Mondays, which seems excessive unless there's a specific need. The author's role is to manage resources and ensure the team's goals are met. Denying an unreasonable request is part of that responsibility.\n\nSo, unless there's a policy allowing such extended time off or a valid reason not mentioned, the author isn't in the wrong. They're enforcing company policies and maintaining team efficiency. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
