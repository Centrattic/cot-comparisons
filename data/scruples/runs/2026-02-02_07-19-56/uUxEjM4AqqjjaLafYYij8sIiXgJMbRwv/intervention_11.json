      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker, who reports to the author, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused and thinks it's not okay, hence the question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and there's no cap on how much you can take, maybe the coworker is within their rights. But if there are limits or specific guidelines, the author might have a point. However, the author didn't mention any policy details, so maybe they didn't check.\n\nNext, the coworker's request is for every Monday for 14 weeks. That's a long time. If the coworker's role is critical, taking so much time could affect the team's workflow. The author, as a manager, has a responsibility to ensure the team's work isn't hampered. Maybe the coworker didn't consider the impact on the team or didn't communicate properly.\n\nBut here's the catch: the coworker already scheduled the time off. If the author denied it after the fact, maybe they should have addressed it earlier. However, if the coworker scheduled it without approval, that's a different issue. The author might need to enforce proper procedures for requesting PTO instead of just denying it without context.\n\nAlso, the coworker is asking for 3-day weekends, which might be a personal choice. If the company allows PTO for any reason, the author shouldn't have the authority to deny it unless there's a valid business reason. But if the author has management authority, they might need to balance employee needs with team efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the author's position depends on company policies, communication from the coworker, and the impact on the team. Without more info, it's hard to say, but if the coworker followed proper procedures and there's no policy against extended time off, the author might be in the wrong for denying it. Alternatively, if the author had valid business reasons, they might be justified. The question is whether the denial was appropriate given the circumstances. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a duty to manage their team effectively and prevent potential issues from extended absences.\n"
