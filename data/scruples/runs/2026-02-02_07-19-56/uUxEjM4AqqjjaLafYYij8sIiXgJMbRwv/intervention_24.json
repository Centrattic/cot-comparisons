      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO, and the author is questioning that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and the coworker used it appropriately according to the policy, then the author might be wrong to deny it. But if the coworker didn't follow proper procedures, like getting approval or if the PTO isn't available for that amount, the author could be right.\n\nThe coworker is asking for every Monday off all summer. That's a lot of days off. If the company has a PTO system where you can take time off as needed, maybe the coworker just scheduled all Mondays without checking with his manager. The author, being his manager, might need to ensure that the team's workload is covered and that such an extended absence doesn't disrupt operations.\n\nAlso, the coworker might not be aware of the impact of taking every Monday off. For example, if the author needs coverage on Mondays or if there are specific projects that require the coworker's presence. The author's responsibility includes managing the team's workload and ensuring that the team functions smoothly even when someone is off.\n\nOn the other hand, if the coworker had already scheduled and was approved for those PTO days, the author might have a duty to honor that unless there's a valid business reason to change it. But if the coworker didn't get approval and just scheduled it without discussion, the author is within their rights to deny it.\n\nSince the post says the coworker \"scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO,\" it's possible he just used his allocated PTO without manager approval. In many companies, taking PTO for extended periods, especially repeatedly, requires manager sign-off. If that's the case, the author isn't in the wrong for denying it because the coworker didn't follow the correct process.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the manager has the responsibility to manage PTO requests and ensure team operations aren't disrupted. The coworker should have discussed the request with the author first, and the author has the authority to deny it if it's not feasible.\n"
