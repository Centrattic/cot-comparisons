      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The situation is that a guy who reports to them scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused why the coworker thinks that's okay and denies the request.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author made a mistake here. Let me break it down. The coworker is asking for every Monday off during the summer. Depending on the company's PTO policy, this could be allowed or not. If the company allows employees to take PTO as they wish, then the coworker might be within their rights. However, if the manager has the authority to approve or deny PTO based on team needs, then the author might be justified in denying.\n\nBut the key here is that the coworker scheduled the days off without getting approval first. If the author is the manager, then they might have the right to deny unscheduled time off. However, if the coworker followed the proper procedure, maybe the author should have considered it. Also, taking 14 Mondays in a row might affect team operations. The author's role as a manager includes ensuring that the team can function properly, so if the coworker's absence would cause issues, the denial makes sense. \n\nAnother angle: if the company's PTO policy allows for such requests, the coworker could be in the right. But if the manager has discretion, then the author is in the right. The AITA format often looks at company policies and procedures. Since the author is the manager and the coworker didn't get approval, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for denying. Plus, the author is questioning the coworker's decision, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They are doing their job as a manager to ensure team functionality and have the authority to deny unscheduled or excessive time off that could disrupt work.\n"
