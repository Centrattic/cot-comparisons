      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is someone who reports to them, so the author is likely a manager or supervisor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the company's PTO policies. If the company allows accumulating enough PTO to take 14 Mondays off, then technically the coworker could be following policy. But usually, companies have limits on consecutive days off or require approval for extended time. The author might have a policy that prevents such long stretches of PTO, especially if it affects team operations. \n\nAlso, the coworker is asking for every Monday off, which could cause scheduling issues. If the author's team needs coverage on Mondays, denying the request makes sense. The author is a manager, so it's their responsibility to ensure the team's work isn't disrupted. The coworker's request seems excessive, taking 3-day weekends every week for the entire summer. That's a lot of time off, and it's understandable the author would question it.\n\nBut maybe the coworker has a valid reason, like family commitments. However, the author didn't mention any such reason. The key points are whether the request is within company policy and if it's reasonable. If the coworker didn't follow the proper process or if the request is beyond policy, the author is justified in denying it. Since the author is the one in charge, they have the authority to make such decisions. So, the author is probably not in the wrong here. Answer B."
