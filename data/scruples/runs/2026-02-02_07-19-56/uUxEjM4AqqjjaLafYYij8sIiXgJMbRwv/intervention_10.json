      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is that someone's coworker asked to take every Monday off for PTO all summer, which is 14 consecutive Mondays. The person asking (the author) is their manager and denied the request. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and an employee has enough accrued time, then taking time off is generally their right. But if the coworker scheduled 14 Mondays without checking with the manager, that's a problem because the manager needs to approve such requests. The author, being the manager, has the authority to deny it if it's not feasible. But maybe the coworker didn't communicate properly. Also, taking every Monday could affect team coverage, especially if it's a critical time. The author isn't in the wrong for denying an unapproved, potentially disruptive schedule. So the answer is B.\n"
