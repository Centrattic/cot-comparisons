      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that someone who reports to the author asked to take every Monday off all summer as PTO, which is 14 Mondays. The author is asking if they're the a**hole for denying that request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company has specific rules about PTO, like how much can be taken at once or the process for requesting time off, then the co-worker might be violating those. If the co-worker scheduled 14 Mondays without checking with the supervisor, maybe they didn't follow the proper procedure. But the author is in charge, so they have the authority to approve or deny PTO requests. \n\nAnother angle is the fairness of the request. Taking every Monday off for 14 weeks sounds excessive. That's almost half the summer. If the team needs coverage on Mondays, and the co-worker isn't offering to cover other days or find a replacement, that could cause problems. The author might be right in denying it to maintain work coverage and prevent possible burnout on the team.\n\nHowever, the co-worker might have a valid reason for wanting those days off, like a personal commitment or family obligations. If the company allows PTO and the co-worker used their allocated days properly, maybe the author's denial is overly harsh. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since supervisors typically have the authority to manage schedules and workload, the author isn't necessarily wrong for denying the request. They might be ensuring that work continues smoothly and that the team isn't overburdened. The co-worker's request seems unreasonable without a valid justification or arrangement for coverage. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
