      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is scheduled to report to the author, which means the author is their manager.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The co-worker has requested 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. The author is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's okay and is denying the request. The key points here are about company policy regarding PTO, the manager's authority, and whether the request is reasonable.\n\nManagers typically have the authority to approve or deny PTO requests based on business needs and team coverage. If the co-worker requested a lot of time off, especially all Mondays, which are workdays, the manager might deny it if it impacts team operations. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong just for denying the request. However, there might be nuances. If the company allows PTO as long as it's scheduled and doesn't affect work, then denying might be seen as unreasonable. But if the team needs coverage or the manager has a policy against extended time off without a valid reason, then the denial is justified.\n\nThe original post's tone is questioning the co-worker's assumption that taking every Monday off is acceptable. The author isn't being unreasonable by questioning that assumption. The answer would depend on company policy, but since the manager has the authority, the author isn't in the wrong for denying. So the answer is B.\n"
