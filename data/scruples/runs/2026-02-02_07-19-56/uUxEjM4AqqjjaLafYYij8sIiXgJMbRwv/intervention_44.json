      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker is someone who reports to the author, so the author is their manager.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO and the coworker has enough accrued time, then maybe the coworker is within their rights to request those days. But managers usually have the authority to approve or deny PTO based on business needs. So if the author's team needs coverage on Mondays, they can deny it.\n\nThe coworker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off. That's a lot. Maybe the author didn't know about the company's PTO rules. But if the coworker requested it properly and the author didn't check the calendar or policies, then the author might be overreacting. However, if the coworker didn't follow proper procedures, the author is right to deny it.\n\nAlso, the author's tone seems defensive. They might be in the right if they need the team to be present on Mondays. But if the coworker had already scheduled the days correctly, then the author could be at fault for not allowing the time off. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the coworker followed policy and if the author checked before denying. Without more info, but given that the coworker reported to the author, the author has the authority to manage PTO requests. So maybe the author isn't wrong. Answer B.\n"
