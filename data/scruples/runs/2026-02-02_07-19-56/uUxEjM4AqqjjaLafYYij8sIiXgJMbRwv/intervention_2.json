      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for denying their coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the coworker, who reports to the author, has scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. The author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay and is denying the request. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nI need to consider company policies on PTO. If the coworker has the right to take PTO as per company rules, then the author, as a manager, might be overstepping by denying it. However, there might be exceptions. For example, if the coworker didn't follow the proper procedure for requesting time off, or if the timing is causing operational issues (like during a busy period or when coverage is needed), the author could have a valid reason to deny it.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Whether the coworker properly requested the time off following company procedures, and 2) Whether the request is feasible given the department's needs. If the coworker just scheduled it without approval, the author has a right to deny. But if the request was made and approved previously, the author might be in the wrong. The scenario mentions the coworker \"scheduled\" the time off, implying he might have done it without prior approval. In that case, the author denying it isn't wrong. However, if the coworker had the right to schedule PTO independently, then the author might be at fault. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous, but the fact that the author is questioning why the coworker thinks it's okay suggests there might be a policy violation. So leaning towards the author being in the right (B).\n"
