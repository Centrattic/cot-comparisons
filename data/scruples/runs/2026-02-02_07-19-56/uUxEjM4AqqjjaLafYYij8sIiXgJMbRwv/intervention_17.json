      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker, who reports to the author, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is questioning why the coworker thinks that's okay and is denying the request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker is asking for Mondays off for the entire summer, which would mean taking every Monday for 14 weeks. That's a lot of time off. As a manager, the author has the responsibility to ensure that the team's workload is covered. If this coworker is taking such extended time off, it could impact team productivity and coverage. The author's denial might be based on operational needs, ensuring that the team can function without that person's absence each week.\n\nThen there's the question of company policy. If the company allows PTO and there's a process for requesting it, the coworker should have followed that. The author, as a manager, has the authority to approve or deny PTO based on team needs. If the coworker didn't check if the schedule was feasible or if they assumed it was okay without approval, that might be their mistake. The author denying the request isn't necessarily the issue here unless there's a violation of policy or lack of communication.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the coworker ask for the time off in advance? If they scheduled it without prior approval, that's a red flag. The author might not have been informed until the PTO was already scheduled, leading to a conflict. In that case, the coworker's approach is inappropriate because they didn't coordinate with their manager.\n\nHowever, if the coworker did follow the proper procedure and the author unreasonably denied it without a valid business reason, then the author might be in the wrong. But given the scenario as described, the coworker is asking for every Monday off for 14 weeks, which is an unusual and extensive request. The author's responsibility is to manage the team effectively, so denying such a long stretch of Mondays might be necessary to maintain team operations.\n\nAlso, the tone of the author's response seems to indicate confusion and frustration, questioning why the coworker thinks it's okay. This suggests that the author wasn't aware of the coworker's prior approval or process, which points to the coworker not following protocol. The author's denial is a reasonable reaction to prevent potential disruptions.\n\nIn most workplaces, PTO requests, especially for extended periods, require approval. If the coworker assumed they could take that time without checking with their manager, they're at fault. The author isn't in the wrong for denying the request to maintain team functionality.\n"
