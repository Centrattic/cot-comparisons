      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for denying a co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is someone who reports to them, and they scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused why the co-worker thinks that's acceptable and is questioning their own judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policy. If the company allows PTO and the employee is using their allotted days, then maybe the request is valid. But if the policy doesn't allow such a long stretch of consecutive days off without prior approval, then the author might be right to deny it. Also, the fact that the employee scheduled all these days off without discussing it with their manager could be a problem. Typically, time off should be requested and approved, especially if it's a recurring pattern that affects team operations. \n\nAnother angle is the workload. If the co-worker is taking every Monday off, that might create a burden on other team members or disrupt projects. The author's responsibility is to ensure the team functions smoothly, so denying the request could be justified if it impacts work. However, if the co-worker has enough PTO balance and it's a personal matter (like family reasons), the author might need to consider flexibility. \n\nAlso, the tone of the original post suggests confusion. The author isn't sure why the co-worker thinks it's okay. This might indicate they're not clued into the company's usual practices. Maybe other employees take similar time off, or maybe the co-worker has a valid reason. The author should probably check the policy and communicate with the employee to understand the reason before making a decision. \n\nIn summary, if the company policy allows it and the employee followed the correct procedure, then the author might be in the wrong for denying without understanding. But if the policy doesn't allow such a long absence or the employee didn't follow protocol, the author is justified. Since the scenario mentions the employee scheduled 14 Mondays without prior discussion, the author's denial could be correct to maintain team functionality and proper procedures. So the answer is B.\n"
