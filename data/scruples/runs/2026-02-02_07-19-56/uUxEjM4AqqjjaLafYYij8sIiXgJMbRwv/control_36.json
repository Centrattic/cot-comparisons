      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a coworker who reports to the author wants to take every Monday off all summer as PTO. The author is denying that request and asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the company allows PTO, maybe the employee is within their rights to use it. But if there's a policy limiting consecutive days or requiring approval, the manager might have the authority to deny. The coworker took 14 Mondays in a row, which is a lot. That's two months of every Monday off. If the company's PTO policy allows that much time off, maybe the coworker is correct. But if the manager's role is to ensure coverage and team balance, denying could be necessary.\n\nAlso, the manager's responsibility is to manage the team's workload. If every Monday is off, it might create scheduling issues. The author might be right in denying to prevent disruption. The coworker might not have considered how their absence affects the team. The key points here are company policy and team impact. If the company allows it and the team can handle the absence, the manager might be wrong. But if the manager needs to maintain operational efficiency, they might be right to deny. Without knowing the specific policies, it's a bit tricky, but generally, managers have the authority to deny time off if they feel it's unreasonable. So probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
