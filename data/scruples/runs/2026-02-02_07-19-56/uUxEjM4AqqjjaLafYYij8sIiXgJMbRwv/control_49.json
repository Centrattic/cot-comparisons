      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying a coworker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The coworker, who reports to the author, scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays as PTO. The author is confused about why the coworker thinks that's okay and is questioning if they're tripping.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is a manager, and the coworker is their subordinate. The coworker wanted to take every Monday off for three-day weekends all summer. The author denied this request. The question is whether the author is wrong to do so.\n\nIn most workplaces, managers have the authority to approve or deny PTO requests based on business needs. Employees typically need to request time off in advance and get approval. The coworker scheduled 14 Mondays off, which seems like a pattern that could disrupt team operations, especially if Mondays are a busy time. The author, as the manager, has the responsibility to ensure that the team's workload is managed and that operations aren't negatively impacted by an employee's absence.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author is the manager, so they have the authority. 2) The coworker's request is for a long period (all summer), which could be seen as excessive and potentially affecting team productivity. 3) The coworker scheduled it themselves without approval, which might be against company policy. \n\nIf the company policy allows for such PTO, the author might have to consider it, but if the coworker didn't follow the proper process, the author is justified in denying it. Also, taking every Monday off could set a bad precedent for other employees. The author's confusion is valid because 14 Mondays is a significant amount of time. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for denying the request. They have the responsibility to manage the team's schedule and ensure that work is covered. The coworker's approach seems inappropriate, and the author is correct in questioning the request. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
