      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for denying their co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The person who wrote the post is a manager, since the co-worker reports to them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The co-worker asked for 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. The author is confused and thinks it's unreasonable to have a three-day weekend each week during the summer. They're questioning if they're wrong for denying the request.\n\nSo, to figure out if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider a few things. First, are there company policies about PTO? If the company allows employees to take PTO as they see fit, as long as it's scheduled and approved, then maybe the co-worker is within their rights. However, if the manager has the authority to approve or deny based on team needs, then the manager might have the right to say no.\n\nAnother angle is the co-worker's reason for taking the Mondays off. If the co-worker provided a valid reason (like a family commitment or another legitimate personal matter), the manager might need to accommodate unless it's causing operational issues. But if the request is arbitrary and the co-worker just wants more time off without a specific reason, the manager could reasonably deny it, especially if it affects team coverage or workload.\n\nAlso, considering the manager's role, they have a responsibility to ensure the team's work is covered. If having the co-worker off every Monday would create scheduling problems, it's the manager's job to address that. The manager isn't wrong for denying a request that could disrupt the team's workflow.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but upon reflection, the manager has the authority to make such decisions. The co-worker might be overreaching by taking so much time off without a clear justification. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for denying the request.\n"
