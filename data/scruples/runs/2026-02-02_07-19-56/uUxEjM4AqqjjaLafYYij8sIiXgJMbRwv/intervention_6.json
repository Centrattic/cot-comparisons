      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for denying a co-worker's request to take every Monday off all summer. The co-worker is a guy who reports to the author, so the author is their manager.\n\nFirst, the co-worker scheduled 14 consecutive Mondays off as PTO. That's a lot of time off, especially if it's all in a row. The author is questioning why the co-worker thinks that's acceptable and is surprised that the co-worker expects three-day weekends all summer. The author then says \"No, sir\" implying they denied the request.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The user is asking for a yes or no answer (A for yes, B for no), so I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nLegally and in terms of company policy, if the co-worker had the appropriate number of PTO days accumulated and the company allows such requests, then the author denying without clear cause might be in the wrong. However, if the company policy doesn't allow taking time off in such large blocks or if the author has a reason to deny it (like operational needs, coverage issues, etc.), then the author is justified.\n\nBut in the AITA scenario, the key is whether the author acted appropriately given the situation. The co-worker is an employee, and as their manager, the author has the authority to approve or deny PTO requests. If the author has a valid reason for denying, like the team can't cover the workload or the request is unreasonable (taking every Monday for 14 weeks), then the author is not in the wrong. However, if there's no policy against it and the author is being unfair without a valid reason, then maybe the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe problem is that the author didn't provide specific reasons for the denial. They just expressed confusion and surprise. The co-worker might have a policy that allows such requests, and the author's refusal without explanation could be seen as unfair. However, in many workplaces, managers do have discretion to deny PTO requests if they believe it's in the best interest of the team or business. So, unless there's a clear policy violation, the author's decision might be within their rights.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the manager can reasonably deny unreasonable requests, especially if taking every Monday off would cause operational issues. The author's confusion is understandable, and the denial is within their authority as a manager.\n"
