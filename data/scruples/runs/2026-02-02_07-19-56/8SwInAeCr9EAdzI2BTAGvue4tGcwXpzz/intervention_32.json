I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend making sexist remarks about female gamers and the author getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the boyfriend's behavior. He made a generalization that all girls who game are bad, used derogatory language like \"bitches,\" and dismissed the author's concerns. That's clearly problematic. Generalizing a group based on stereotypes is a form of sexism, and using derogatory terms adds to the issue. His response to her being a girl who games was dismissive and condescending, which is not acceptable.\n\nThen there's the author's reaction. She got mad, called him a \"dick,\" and ended the game session. She confronted him about the sexism and expressed her disagreement. Her actions seem like a reasonable response to being subjected to sexist remarks, especially since she's a female gamer herself. She's standing up for herself and challenging his generalizations, which is valid.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that she took offense when there was no offense is a classic deflection. He's not taking responsibility for his words. The author pointing out that he doesn't make the same comments about male players is a good point, highlighting the double standard.\n\nThe author's reaction of being upset and ending the session isn't overreacting. It's a healthy boundary to not engage in toxic behavior. Even though she called him a few expletives, that's a common expression of frustration in such situations and doesn't necessarily make her wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend is in the wrong for his sexist remarks and toxic behavior. The author is justified in her reaction. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
