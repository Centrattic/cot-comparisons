I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend when he made sexist comments about female gamers. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend said all girls who game are bad and used derogatory terms. The author took offense, which is a reasonable reaction. The boyfriend's comments are clearly sexist, promoting a stereotype that all women are bad at gaming. The author called him out for it, which shows she's standing up against his harmful views.\n\nThe boyfriend then called her a \"whiny bitch\" and said she wasn't a \"female in the wild,\" which seems like a dismissive and degrading response. The author's frustration led her to call him a \"dick,\" but that's a common reaction when someone feels disrespected. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's initial sexist remarks and his subsequent belittling of her feelings. The author had a right to be upset because his comments were not just offensive but also contradictory to the reality they've experienced (they've encountered bad male players too). \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he didn't say anything offensive is weak, especially since he was generalizing all women. The author's response, while heated, was a defense against his sexism. She also acknowledged his helpfulness in teaching her, but that doesn't excuse his harmful statements. \n\nIn such situations, expressing discomfort and setting boundaries is important. The author didn't overreact; she responded to toxic behavior. The boyfriend's reaction was more problematic. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
