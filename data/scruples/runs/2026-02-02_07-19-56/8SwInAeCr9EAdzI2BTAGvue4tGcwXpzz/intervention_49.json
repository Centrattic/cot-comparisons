I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a sexist comment, saying all girls who game are bad. He used a teammate's \"girly\" username to generalize about all female gamers and used derogatory language like \"bitches.\" The author got frustrated, asked if he thought she was bad, and he replied that she wouldn't be if she had him. Then the boyfriend called her a \"whiny bitch\" and said she's not a \"female in the wild,\" implying she's an exception. \n\nThe author felt offended and called him a \"dick,\" told him not to play with her if he thinks she's bad, and accused him of sexism. The boyfriend then ranted about hunting instincts, which is a gender stereotype. \n\nThe author is questioning if she overreacted. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking another opinion.\n\nConsidering the situation, the boyfriend made a sexist generalization and used derogatory terms. The author responded in kind, which could be seen as reactive, but the core issue is the boyfriend's sexist remarks. The author is not in the wrong for being upset about his comments. Generalizing about a gender is offensive, and calling someone a derogatory term in response is understandable in self-defense. The boyfriend's behavior was the root cause, so the author's reaction is justified. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
