I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend after he made sexist remarks about female gamers.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend said all girls who game are bad and used derogatory language. The author called him out, which is a reasonable response to sexism. He then called her a whiny bitch and made excuses, which escalates the conflict. \n\nThe author got mad, called him a dick, and ended the conversation. She's questioning if she overreacted. The key points here are about respect and addressing harmful speech. The boyfriend's initial comments are clearly problematic, and the author standing up for herself isn't overreaction. \n\nThe boyfriend's justification that he didn't say anything offensive ignores the hurtful nature of his remarks. The author's frustration stems from being defensive of her own presence in gaming and others'. Her reaction is valid under these circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing sexism appropriately. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not her response.\n"
