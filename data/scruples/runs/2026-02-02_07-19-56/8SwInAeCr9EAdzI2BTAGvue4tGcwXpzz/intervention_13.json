I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they got angry at their boyfriend for making sexist remarks about female gamers. The boyfriend said all girls who game are bad, used derogatory language, and then called the author a \"whiny bitch\" after she confronted him. The author responded by calling him a \"dick\" and ending the game session.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's actions. Making a blanket statement that all girls are bad at gaming is clearly sexist. Using terms like \"bitches\" is disrespectful and misogynistic. When the author challenges him, his response is dismissive and further degrading. He also brings up the idea that she's not a \"female in the wild,\" which seems to imply that only certain women are good at gaming, which is still sexist. His complaint that she took offense when he didn't mean to be offensive is a form of gaslighting, which is manipulative.\n\nThe author's reaction includes getting mad, calling him names, and stopping the game. While calling someone a \"dick\" might be harsh, it's a common expression to express frustration. The key issue here is the boyfriend's sexist remarks and his failure to acknowledge the problem. The author is standing up against his harmful statements, which is a valid response. The boyfriend's use of derogatory terms and his refusal to see the issue are problematic. The author isn't overreacting to being called a \"bad\" gamer because the boyfriend's statement is a generalization and an insult. The fact that the boyfriend has taught her things in games doesn't excuse his bigotry. People can have both helpful qualities and harmful beliefs.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for defending herself against sexist comments. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
