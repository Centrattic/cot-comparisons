I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the boyfriend making sexist remarks about female gamers, the author getting upset, and the subsequent argument.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comments about girls being bad at gaming and using derogatory terms like \"bitches\" are clearly problematic. The author called out his behavior, which is a valid response. The boyfriend then escalated by calling her names and dismissing her feelings, which is not acceptable.\n\nThe author's reaction includes getting mad and using some strong language (\"dick\" a few times), but that's in response to his sexist remarks. She also set a boundary by stopping the game and discussing the issue. It's important to note that the boyfriend didn't acknowledge his part in the conflict and instead blamed her for being too sensitive. \n\nThe key points here are about respect and equality. The boyfriend's initial comments were sexist, and the author's response was defending her stance against that. The boyfriend's follow-up comments about her not being a \"female in the wild\" are condescending and further evidence of his problematic views. \n\nWhile the author did respond with frustration, her actions were in self-defense against sexist behavior. She also acknowledged his help but stood her ground on the issue. The boyfriend's refusal to see his wrongdoing is a bigger issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She had every right to be upset and to address his sexism. The boyfriend's actions and words were the main problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
