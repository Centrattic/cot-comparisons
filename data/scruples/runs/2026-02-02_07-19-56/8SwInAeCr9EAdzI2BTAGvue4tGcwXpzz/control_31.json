I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their boyfriend's comments about female gamers.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a generalized negative statement about all girls in gaming, using derogatory language like \"bitches.\" The author is a girl who games and felt targeted by his remarks. She confronted him, and he dismissed her concerns, even calling her a \"whiny bitch.\" He then continued to make sexist comments about women lacking hunting instincts. \n\nThe author stopped playing and called him a few names in response. The key points here are the initial offensive comments from the boyfriend, the author's valid reaction to being targeted, and the boyfriend's subsequent dismissive and derogatory responses. \n\nThe boyfriend's statements about gender stereotypes in gaming are clearly problematic. The author's reaction is understandable as she's being personally attacked. While she did use some harsh language, the context is a heated argument where both parties are upset. However, the main issue is the boyfriend's sexist remarks and refusal to acknowledge the problem. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself against sexist comments. Her reaction, while maybe a bit heated, is a response to being belittled. The boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
