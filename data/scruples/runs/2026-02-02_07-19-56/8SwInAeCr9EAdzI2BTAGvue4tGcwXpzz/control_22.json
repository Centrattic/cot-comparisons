I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether she overreacted when her boyfriend made sexist comments about female gamers.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend made a generalization that all girls who game are bad and used derogatory language, calling them \"bitches.\" The author, who is a girl, took offense because he was essentially saying she was bad too unless he helped her. She confronted him, and he called her a \"whiny bitch\" and other things. She then stopped playing and they had an argument.\n\nThe key points here are the use of sexist remarks and the generalization of all female gamers. The boyfriend is making a sweeping statement based on gender, which is a form of sexism. The author is upset because he's dismissing her skills and the skills of other women based on their gender. She also points out that he doesn't make similar comments about male players, which highlights the double standard.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he didn't say anything offensive, but his language and the generalization are clearly offensive. The author is justified in feeling that his comments were sexist and that she took offense because they were discriminatory. She didn't overreact by standing up for herself, pointing out the sexism, and ending the interaction. The boyfriend's response of calling her names and dismissing her feelings is also problematic.\n\nIn terms of whether she is in the wrong (option A) or not (option B), the answer should be B. The author is not in the wrong because she is responding to sexist comments, which are not acceptable. Her reaction is a valid response to being disrespected and to the boyfriend's discriminatory views. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's reaction to it.\n"
