I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend making a sexist comment about girls being bad at gaming, and the author getting upset. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The boyfriend said that all girls who game are bad, used derogatory language (\"bitches\"), and then dismissed the author's concerns by saying she's not \"a female in the wild\" because she's with him. The author responded by getting mad, calling him a dick, and confronting him about the sexism.\n\nThe core issue here is the boyfriend's sexist remarks. Making a generalization about an entire gender based on stereotypes is problematic. The author is justified in being upset because the boyfriend's comments are not only offensive but also invalid. The boyfriend is making a sweeping statement that's not based on evidence, which is a form of sexism. The author pointing this out is reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend then doubles down by calling her a \"whiny bitch\" and continuing to rant about gender differences, which shows he's not taking her concerns seriously. The author's reaction, while maybe emotional, is in response to being disrespected and invalidated. She's standing up for herself and pointing out the inconsistency in his behavior when dealing with male players versus female ones.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he didn't say anything offensive is weak. Using terms like \"bitches\" and making a generalization about all women in gaming is clearly offensive. The author isn't overreacting by taking offense. She's challenging the sexism and setting boundaries, which is appropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend's justification that \"he only noticed the girl's username was girly\" doesn't hold because it's still stereotyping. It doesn't matter if he's pointing out a specific instance; making a generalization about all women based on one example is flawed logic. The author is correct in pointing out that he's being sexist.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's response to her confrontation\u2014calling her names and dismissing her feelings\u2014shows a lack of empathy and an unwillingness to engage in constructive dialogue. The author's decision to stop playing and address the issue is a valid choice to protect her own comfort and values.\n\nThe boyfriend's previous helpfulness in teaching her to play doesn't negate his current behavior. The author isn't denying his contributions but is standing up against his sexist remarks. It's reasonable to have different expectations for respectful behavior in a relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend's actions were in the wrong by making sexist comments and then retaliating against the author's valid concerns. The author's response was appropriate in calling out the sexism and setting boundaries. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
