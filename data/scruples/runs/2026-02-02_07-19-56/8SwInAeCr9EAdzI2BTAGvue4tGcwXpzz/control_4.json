I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The main issue is that the boyfriend made a comment about all girls being bad at gaming, called them bitches, and the author got mad. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a generalization about all girls being bad at gaming, which is a sexist statement. The author points out that this is unfair, especially since there are bad male players too. The boyfriend then justifies his comments and even insults the author by saying she's not a \"female in the wild,\" implying that only certain women are bad. He also calls her a \"whiny bitch\" and accuses her of taking offense to something that wasn't offensive. \n\nThe author's reaction includes calling him a \"dick\" and ending the gaming session, which is a reasonable response to hurtful comments. She's also pointing out the inconsistency in his criticism towards women versus men, which is valid. The boyfriend's behavior includes making sweeping generalizations and using derogatory language, which are problematic. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for standing up for herself and expressing her discomfort with his sexist remarks. The boyfriend's comments are the root issue here. While the author did respond with some strong language, his initial statements were more harmful and offensive. The fact that he has taught her things in the game doesn't negate the sexist comments he made. It's about respecting each other's views and recognizing that making generalizations based on gender is inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, and the author is justified in her reaction. The answer should be B.\n"
