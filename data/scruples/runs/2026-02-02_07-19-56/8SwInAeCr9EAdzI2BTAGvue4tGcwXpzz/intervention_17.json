I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend made a sexist comment about girls being bad at gaming, and the author got upset, leading to an argument. The boyfriend called her a \"whiny bitch\" and said she's not a \"female in the wild,\" implying that only \"real\" females are bad. The author feels she didn't overreact, but the user thinks maybe she did.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's actions. Making a generalization that all girls are bad at gaming is a classic example of sexism. He's devaluing a group based on gender, which is offensive. The author points out that he doesn't say the same about bad male players, which shows inconsistency. That's a valid point. Also, he called her a \"whiny bitch\" when she expressed her feelings, which is both sexist and abusive. That's a red flag.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he didn't say anything offensive is incorrect. Generalizations based on gender are harmful even if they're not direct slurs. The author's reaction to his sexist comments is justified. She's standing up against his harmful beliefs. It's important to note that calling him names like \"dick\" in response is not ideal, but it's a reaction to his offensive behavior, not the root issue.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but from the description, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. The author is defending herself against his sexism. The boyfriend's actions include not just the initial comment but also the derogatory language and invalidation of her feelings. The author is in a position where she's trying to address his behavior, which is important for a healthy relationship. She's not the one in the wrong here; the boyfriend's actions are the issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
