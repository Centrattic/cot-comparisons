I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for making sexist comments during a game. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend called all girls who game \"bad\" and used a derogatory term. The author took offense, which is understandable because making a blanket statement based on gender is sexist. She challenged him by asking if he thought she was bad, and he made a condescending reply. She stopped playing and they had a heated exchange where he called her a \"whiny bitch\" and dismissed her concerns by saying she wasn't a \"female in the wild\" anymore. \n\nHe also argued that she took offense to something he didn't mean to be offensive. The author points out the double standard where he doesn't criticize male players who perform poorly. She did call him a \"dick\" a few times, but that's a common expression of frustration and doesn't seem out of line given the context. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend's comments were offensive. Making a generalization that all girls are bad at gaming is clearly sexist. The author is right to challenge that. Even though the boyfriend taught her some gaming skills, that doesn't excuse his sexist remarks. The author's reaction is a valid response to discrimination. There's no evidence she overreacted; she expressed her feelings and set boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
