I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend making sexist comments about girls in gaming, and the author reacting by getting angry and calling him a dick.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend made a generalization that all girls who game are bad, using a teammate's \"girly\" username as an example. He used derogatory language, calling girls \"bitches.\" The author, being a female gamer, took offense and confronted him, leading to an argument where he dismissed her feelings and continued with his sexist remarks. The author stopped playing and called him a dick, which led to a back-and-forth.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's comments are clearly sexist and make a broad, harmful stereotype. The author's reaction is a valid response to being discriminated against. It's important to note that the boyfriend's behavior was offensive first. The author's use of strong language (\"call him a dick\") is a reaction to his derogatory remarks. The boyfriend also dismissed her concerns, which is problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions are the initial problem. The author defending herself and expressing her frustration is justified. The boyfriend's argument that she's not \"a female in the wild\" implies that only certain women are bad, which is still sexist. The author pointing out the double standard (he didn't comment on bad male players) is a valid point.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for reacting to offensive comments. Her response is a reasonable defense against sexism, and the boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
