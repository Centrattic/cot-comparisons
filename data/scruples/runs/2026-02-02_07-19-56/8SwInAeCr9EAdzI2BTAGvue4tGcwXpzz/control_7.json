I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A or B). The situation involves the boyfriend making a sexist comment about all girls being bad at gaming because a teammate with a girly username did something questionable. The author is upset and confronts him, which leads to more arguments where he calls her a \"whiny bitch\" and talks about hunting instincts. She calls him a dick and stops playing.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's statements are clearly sexist. Generalizing all girls based on one player's behavior is a stereotype and offensive. He uses derogatory language like \"bitches,\" which is harmful. The author points out that he doesn't generalize bad players as male, which is a valid observation. She's justified in feeling her identity is being attacked here.\n\nHe then says she's not a \"female in the wild,\" implying that her being a woman doesn't count unless she's in a competitive environment he defines. That's condescending and dismissive. When she stands up for herself, he labels her as whiny, trying to invalidate her feelings. The author responding by calling him a dick is a reaction to his disrespect, not an initial wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior includes making harmful generalizations and using derogatory terms, which is on him. The author is defending herself against sexism. Even though she might have used strong language, it's in response to his offensive remarks. The key point is that the boyfriend's actions were the root of the conflict. She's questioning if she overreacted, but his comments were clearly the issue. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
