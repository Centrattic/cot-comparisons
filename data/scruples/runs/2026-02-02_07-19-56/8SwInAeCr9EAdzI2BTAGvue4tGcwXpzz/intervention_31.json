I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the boyfriend making sexist remarks about female gamers, and the author getting upset and ending the game session. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend made a generalization that all girls who game are bad, and used derogatory language. The author took offense, which is a reasonable reaction given the sexist comments. The boyfriend then called her a \"whiny bitch\" and said she's not a \"female in the wild,\" which seems dismissive and further degrading. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is now seeking input. The key points here are about sexism in gaming, personal boundaries, and whether the author overreacted. The boyfriend's behavior included making a broad, sexist statement and using abusive language. The author's response was to express her frustration, which is valid when faced with discrimination. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he didn't say anything offensive is problematic because his statements clearly targeted a group (women) and used derogatory terms. The author's actions of calling him a \"dick\" and ending the session are justified as she was defending herself against his harmful remarks. \n\nConsidering that the boyfriend has a history of making sexist comments and the author felt disrespected, it's important to recognize that standing up against sexism is not overreacting. The fact that the author has benefited from his help in gaming doesn't negate the issue of his sexist behavior. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her reaction is a valid response to being subjected to sexist and abusive comments. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and the author had the right to express her discomfort and stop engaging. So the answer should be B.\n"
