I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend's comments about girls in gaming. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The boyfriend made a generalization that all girls who game are bad, using a teammate's \"girly\" username as a reason. He called girls \"bitches\" and then when she confronted him, he trivialized her feelings, saying she's not \"a female in the wild\" so she's not bad. He also compared it to guys being bad players but he didn't comment on them, which makes her feel it's double standard.\n\nThe boyfriend's comments are clearly sexist. Making broad generalizations about any gender is problematic. By saying all girls are bad at gaming because of one instance, he's perpetuating a stereotype. Using derogatory language like \"bitches\" adds insult to injury. When the author confronts him, he minimizes her feelings and brings in the idea that she's an exception because of him, which is dismissive and invalidating.\n\nThe author's reaction is to call him a dick and confront him about his sexist views. She's standing up for herself and pointing out the hypocrisy. Since he was the one who initiated the bigoted comments, her being upset isn't overreacting. The boyfriend is in the wrong here for his initial comments and his subsequent response. The author isn't wrong for taking offense and standing up for herself. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
