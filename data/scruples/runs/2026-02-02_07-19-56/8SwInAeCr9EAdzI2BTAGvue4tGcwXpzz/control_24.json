I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend making sexist remarks about female gamers.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend says all girls who game are bad and uses derogatory language like \"bitches.\" The author gets upset and confronts him, which leads to further conflict. He also makes a comment about her not being a \"female in the wild,\" which seems dismissive and degrading. \n\nThe key points here are the sexist comments and the use of derogatory terms. The author's reaction\u2014calling him a dick and confronting him\u2014is a response to his offensive statements. The boyfriend's argument is that he didn't say anything offensive, but his language and generalizations about women are clearly problematic. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's statements are sexist and offensive. The author taking offense is a reasonable response. The boyfriend's justification that he didn't mean to be offensive doesn't negate the harm caused by his words. Additionally, the author's actions in standing up for herself and expressing her frustration are valid given the context. \n\nThe boyfriend's history of teaching her how to play doesn't excuse his sexist remarks. It's possible to acknowledge someone's positive contributions while still holding them accountable for harmful behavior. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for being upset and responding to his sexist comments. Her reaction is a legitimate response to discrimination and disrespect.\n"
