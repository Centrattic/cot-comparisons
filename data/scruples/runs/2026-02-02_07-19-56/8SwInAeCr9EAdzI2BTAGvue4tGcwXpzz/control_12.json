I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because their boyfriend made a comment about all girls who game being bad. He was talking about a teammate with a \"girly\" username and started saying girls are bad at games, using derogatory language. The author asked if he thought she was bad too, and he replied that she wouldn't be if it weren't for him. They stopped playing, and later he called her a \"whiny bitch\" and said she wasn't a \"female in the wild,\" implying she's an exception. He also claimed she took offense to something he didn't say. The author called him a dick and told him to not play with her if he thought she was bad. He went on about how girls lack hunting instinct. The author has been grateful for his help with games but disagrees with his comments.\n\nSo, the question is whether she overreacted. The boyfriend made sexist remarks, used a derogatory term (\"bitches\"), generalized all female gamers as bad, and dismissed her feelings by calling her names. The author stood up for herself, which is a valid response. He's the one who made offensive comments and then blamed her. Even though she called him names, his comments were more harmful and sexist. The key points are his generalizations and derogatory language. She's not in the wrong for being upset about sexism. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
