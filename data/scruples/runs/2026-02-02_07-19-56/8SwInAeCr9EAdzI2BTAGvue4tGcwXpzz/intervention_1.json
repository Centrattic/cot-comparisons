I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (their boyfriend's girlfriend) is in the wrong for getting mad at his sexist comments during a game.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made generalizations about all girls being bad at gaming and used derogatory language (\"bitches\"). The author called out his behavior, which he dismissed by saying she was a \"whiny bitch\" and that she wasn't a \"female in the wild,\" implying that only certain women are bad. The author then called him a \"dick\" a few times and confronted his sexism. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's sexist remarks and the author's reaction. The boyfriend justified his comments by claiming he was talking about the player's username being girly, but making a broad generalization about all women is inherently sexist. The author is within her right to be upset and call him out for that. His response was dismissive and further degrading, which escalated the conflict. \n\nThe author didn't overreact by standing up for herself and pointing out the sexism. His argument that he was \"not saying anything offensive\" is invalid because the comments were indeed offensive. The fact that he later made a comment about women lacking hunting instincts shows a pattern of sexist thinking. \n\nThe author's anger is justified because the boyfriend was making derogatory and generalizing statements about women, which are harmful. The boyfriend's actions and words were the root cause of the conflict. The author's response, while emotional, was a reasonable reaction to being called names and facing his disrespect. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
