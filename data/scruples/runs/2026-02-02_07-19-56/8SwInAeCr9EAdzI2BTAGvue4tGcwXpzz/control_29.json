I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend making a sexist comment about female gamers, and the author getting upset.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend said that all girls who game are bad, using derogatory language like \"bitches.\" The author is frustrated because she's a female gamer herself, so his comment directly affects her. She challenges him, which leads to an argument where he calls her a \"whiny bitch\" and makes more sexist remarks about women not having a \"hunting instinct.\" \n\nThe boyfriend claims he didn't say anything offensive, but he clearly made a generalization based on gender, which is a form of sexism. The author's reaction includes calling him a \"dick\" a few times, which is understandable in the moment. However, he ends up ranting more about gender stereotypes. \n\nThe key points here are: the boyfriend's sexist comments, the author's valid response to his offensive remarks, and the boyfriend dismissing her concerns. The author isn't overreacting because she's standing up against harmful stereotypes. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author's reaction is appropriate given the situation. The answer should be B, that she's not in the wrong.\n"
