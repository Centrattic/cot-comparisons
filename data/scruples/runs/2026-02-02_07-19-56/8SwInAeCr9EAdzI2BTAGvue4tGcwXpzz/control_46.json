I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend making sexist comments about female gamers, and the author getting upset and ending the game session. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the boyfriend's actions. He made a generalization that all girls who game are bad, used derogatory language (\"bitches\"), and made a comment about the author not being a \"female in the wild.\" These are clear examples of sexist remarks. His statements are discriminatory and disrespectful, targeting a specific gender based on a stereotype.\n\nThe author's reaction includes feeling frustrated, asking if he thinks she's bad, and then deciding to stop playing. She also called him a \"dick\" a couple of times and expressed her disagreement with his views. Her response is a direct reaction to his offensive comments. It's important to note that she's standing up against sexism, which is a valid and important stance.\n\nThe boyfriend claims that she took offense where none was intended, but his comments were clearly sexist. The author points out that the same boyfriend doesn't make similar remarks about male players, highlighting the inconsistency. She also acknowledges the boyfriend's helpfulness in teaching her how to play, but that doesn't excuse his sexist behavior.\n\nNow, considering whether she overreacted. Reacting to sexist remarks with frustration and calling someone out for their behavior isn't overreaction. It's a reasonable response to discrimination. Her decision to stop playing is a personal choice to disengage from toxic behavior. The boyfriend's subsequent rant about hunting instincts and his derogatory comments further justify her stance.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to respect each other's views and address issues when they arise. The boyfriend's comments are harmful, and the author is justified in feeling upset. Her actions were a response to being disrespected and facing sexist attitudes. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
