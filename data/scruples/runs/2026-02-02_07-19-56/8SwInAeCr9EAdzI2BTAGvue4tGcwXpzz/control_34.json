I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is upset with their boyfriend because he made a comment about all girls being bad at gaming, using the term \"bitches.\" The situation came up when a teammate with a \"girly\" username was playing poorly. The boyfriend started making generalizations about all girls being bad at games. The author took offense, asked if he thought she was bad too, and he replied that she wouldn't be because she has him. Then the author stopped playing and they had a text argument where he called her a whiny bitch and said she wasn't a female in the wild anymore. The author called him a dick a few times and mentioned his sexism. The boyfriend also brought up hunting instincts being male traits. The author is wondering if she overreacted.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The boyfriend made a sexist comment generalizing all women gamers. The author felt this was offensive and confronted him, leading to an argument. The boyfriend doubled down, making more sexist remarks. The author is defensive and points out that he didn't make similar comments about male players. She also acknowledges that he has helped her with gaming, but is upset about his sexism.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's initial statement: making a generalization that all girls are bad at gaming and using derogatory language (\"bitches\") is clearly sexist. The fact that he singled out a player with a \"girly\" username as the reason for the poor play reinforces this. The author's reaction is a direct response to his sexist remarks. She questions if he thinks she's bad, which is a valid concern given his comment. His response that she's not bad because she has him is dismissive and implies that her skill is due to his help, not her own, which is also problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend's subsequent comments, calling her a whiny bitch and making a joke about her not being a female in the wild, are further examples of disrespectful and sexist behavior. The author's frustration is justified because he didn't acknowledge her feelings and instead continued to make stereotypical remarks. \n\nThe author did call him a dick, which is a strong reaction, but it's in response to his repeated sexist behavior. She also confronted him about his sexism, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's refusal to recognize that his comments were offensive, especially when he would not make similar comments about male players, shows a lack of awareness or acceptance of his bias.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Generalizing and making derogatory remarks about any group is unacceptable, and the boyfriend's behavior crosses a line. The author's reaction, while perhaps heated, is a valid response to being marginalized and facing sexism. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here, not the author's response to them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's comments and behavior are the primary problems. The author's frustration and confrontation are justified responses to his sexism. The fact that she tried to address the issue calmly before escalating shows she wanted to resolve it, but the boyfriend's unwillingness to acknowledge his fault led to the argument. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
