I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend's sexist remarks during a game. The boyfriend made a generalization about all girls being bad at gaming, used derogatory language, and dismissed her feelings. The author called him out, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the boyfriend's comments were inappropriate. Saying all girls are bad and using \"bitches\" is definitely sexist and offensive. The author rightly pointed out that this is a harmful stereotype and that he's applying it to her. His response that she's not \"a female in the wild\" seems to minimize her experience, implying that only certain women (maybe those not into gaming) are exceptions.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense that he didn't say anything offensive is problematic. Using derogatory terms and making sweeping generalizations is offensive regardless of intent. The author's frustration is understandable given the sexist remarks. She also pointed out the inconsistency in his behavior\u2014complaining about female players but not male ones. That's a valid point because it's double standards.\n\nThe author did call him names, but that might be a reaction to his initial comments. It's a common response when someone feels attacked. However, the core issue is his sexist behavior, which is not excusable. The boyfriend's insistence that she's overreacting and his continued sexist remarks (about hunting instinct) further show he's in the wrong.\n\nThe author is justified in standing up for herself, especially since she's been a victim of such stereotypes. She also acknowledges his help in gaming, which shows she's not dismissing his contributions but is focusing on the sexism. Her reaction isn't over the top given the context. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
