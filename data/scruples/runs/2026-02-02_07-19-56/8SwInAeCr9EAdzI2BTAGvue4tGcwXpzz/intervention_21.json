I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. So the boyfriend was making negative comments about girls in gaming, using derogatory terms, and the author got mad, leading to a conflict. The user initially thought the author might be wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend made sweeping generalizations about all girls being bad at gaming because of one teammate's username. He used the term \"bitches,\" which is definitely offensive. The author felt offended and confronted him, leading to an argument where he called her a \"whiny bitch\" and other comments. She called him a \"dick,\" which is a strong reaction, but maybe justified given his words.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's sexist remarks and the use of derogatory language. That's a problem because it perpetuates stereotypes and is disrespectful. The author's reaction stems from feeling targeted by these comments, especially since she's a woman in a space where such stereotypes are common. Her frustration is understandable. She also points out that there are many bad male players, and he doesn't generalize against them, which shows inconsistency.\n\nThe boyfriend's response, claiming he didn't say anything offensive, is part of the issue. Dismissing someone's feelings when they're hurt by sexist remarks is problematic. The author's actions in stopping the game and expressing her feelings are valid reactions. While calling him a \"dick\" is confrontational, it's a response to his offensive language.\n\nThe boyfriend's teaching her about games is a positive, but it doesn't negate his harmful comments. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself against sexism. Her reaction is a form of self-respect and challenging toxic behavior. So, the boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for getting mad and setting boundaries.\n"
