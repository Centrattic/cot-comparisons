I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the boyfriend making a generalization about all girls being bad at video games, using a teammate's username as an example. The author was upset and confronted him, leading to an argument. The boyfriend called her a \"whiny bitch\" and said she wasn't a \"female in the wild,\" implying that because she's his girlfriend, she's an exception. The author called him a \"dick\" and left the game.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author overreacted. The boyfriend made a sexist generalization, which is definitely inappropriate. The author standing up for herself and her own competence as a gamer is reasonable. The boyfriend's comments about other players being bad when they were male but not commenting on that, while doing so for a female player, shows a double standard. The author's reaction\u2014calling him out and not engaging further\u2014seems justified given the offensive remarks. The boyfriend's response, including name-calling, exacerbates the conflict. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about sexist comments. Even though she called him names, that's a reaction to his initial sexism. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
