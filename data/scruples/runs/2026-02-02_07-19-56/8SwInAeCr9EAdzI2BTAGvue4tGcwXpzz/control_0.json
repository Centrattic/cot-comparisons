I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where their boyfriend made sexist remarks about female gamers.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend made a generalization that all girls who game are bad, using a teammate's \"girly\" username as an example. He used derogatory language, calling girls \"bitches.\" The author felt offended because of this, and when she confronted him, he dismissed her feelings, even going so far as to call her a \"whiny bitch\" and saying she's not a \"female in the wild,\" implying she's an exception. The author then calls him a dick a few times and challenges his sexism.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the boyfriend's behavior. Making a broad, derogatory statement about a group based on gender is a form of sexism. The author is calling out that behavior, which is valid. The boyfriend's response is to belittle her feelings, which can be seen as invalidating her experience. The author's reaction, while heated, is a response to being disrespected.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he didn't say anything offensive is contradictory because his language and generalization clearly were offensive. The fact that the author has been grateful for his help in the games doesn't negate the issue here. It's about addressing harmful stereotypes, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nThe user is asking if the author overreacted. The boyfriend's statements are problematic, so the author's reaction isn't over the top. The boyfriend's follow-up insults and invalidation make the situation worse. The author is standing up against sexism, which is a right and reasonable action. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
