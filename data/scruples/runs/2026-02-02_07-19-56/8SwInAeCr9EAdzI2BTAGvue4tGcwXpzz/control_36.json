I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for getting angry at her boyfriend's sexist remarks during a game. The boyfriend made a generalization about all girls being bad at gaming and used derogatory language, which upset the author. He then called her a whiny bitch and made a comment about her not being a \"female in the wild,\" implying that his opinion was based on some outdated or gendered stereotypes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate. Making broad, negative generalizations about a group based on gender is clearly sexism. The boyfriend's use of the word \"bitches\" is also derogatory and disrespectful. The author's reaction is justified because she's pointing out the sexism in his statements. He should not have made those remarks, and her feeling offended is entirely valid.\n\nNext, the boyfriend's response to her being upset is problematic. He called her a \"whiny bitch,\" which is not only dismissive but also uses the same kind of derogatory language he was accused of using. He also tried to justify his comments by saying he didn't say anything offensive, which is a deflection. His argument that girls lack a \"hunting instinct\" is a harmful stereotype that perpetuates gender bias.\n\nThe author did confront him, which shows she stood up for herself. While she did call him a \"dick\" a few times, that's a common reaction to being insulted and doesn't necessarily indicate overreaction. She also communicated that his comments were uncalled for and that she found his behavior offensive. The boyfriend's refusal to acknowledge his part in the conflict and his insistence that she overreacted suggest that he was in the wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend had previously helped her with gaming, which the author acknowledged, but that doesn't excuse his sexist remarks. The fact that he has been supportive in other areas doesn't negate the harmful nature of his comments when it comes to gender stereotypes. People should be held accountable for their harmful statements regardless of other positive interactions.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's sexist generalizations, use of derogatory language, and his dismissive response to her concerns. The author's reaction is a reasonable response to being subjected to such treatment. She's not overreacting; she's addressing the issue of sexism in a situation where it's clearly present. There's no indication that the author is in the wrong for standing up for herself in this context.\n"
