I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend makes a comment about all girls who game being bad, using derogatory language like \"bitches.\" The author, who is a female gamer, gets upset and confronts him. He then says she's not bad because she has him, which seems patronizing. She stops playing and they argue over text. He calls her names and makes a comment about her not being a \"female in the wild,\" which probably means she's not a real gamer. He also insists he didn't say anything offensive. The author calls him a dick, tells him to not play with her if he thinks she's bad, and points out his sexism. He rants about hunting instincts, and the author acknowledges he has helped her with gaming but disagrees with his views.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's sexist remarks and the use of derogatory language. The author is offended because his comments are sexist, and she confronts him. He doesn't seem to apologize and instead doubles down. The question is whether the author overreacted by getting mad and calling him names.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, making sexist comments and using slurs is clearly inappropriate. The author's reaction is a response to being discriminated against. Even though she called him names, his initial behavior was problematic. The boyfriend's justification that he didn't say anything offensive is wrong. The author is standing up for herself against his sexist views. So, the boyfriend is in the wrong for making those comments and not acknowledging her feelings. The author is not in the wrong for being upset and defending herself. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
