I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend's sexist comments during a game.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a generalization about all girls being bad at gaming just because a teammate had a \"girly\" username. He also used derogatory language like \"bitches\" and made a backhanded compliment implying her skill depends on him. The author took offense, which is understandable given the sexist remarks. She called him a \"dick\" and stood her ground, which seems reasonable when facing toxic behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend then retaliated by calling her a \"whiny bitch\" and denying making offensive comments. He brings up her gender in an argument, which isn't productive. The author isn't overreacting to sexism; she's holding him accountable for his words. He's been supportive in teaching her games, but his comments cross into harmful territory with gender stereotypes.\n\nThe key points are: making sweeping generalizations about a group (sexism), using derogatory language, and the author defending herself against that. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author's reaction is a valid response to his sexism. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
