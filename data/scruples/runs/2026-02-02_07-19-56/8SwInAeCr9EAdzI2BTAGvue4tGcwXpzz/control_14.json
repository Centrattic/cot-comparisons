I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about all girls being bad at gaming because of a teammate with a \"girly\" username. The author got mad because of the sexist remark, especially since she's a girl who plays games. The boyfriend then called her a whiny bitch and made other sexist comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the boyfriend said. He generalized all girls as bad at games, which is a stereotype. The author took offense, which is a valid reaction because such generalizations can be harmful and discriminatory. The boyfriend's response to her being upset was to call her names and minimize her feelings by saying she wasn't a \"female in the wild,\" implying that only certain women are good at gaming. That's pretty toxic behavior.\n\nThe author did call him a dick a few times, which might seem harsh, but his comments were sexist. She also set a boundary by stopping the game, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior included sexism and dismissive attitudes, which are problematic. The author standing up for herself and pointing out his bias isn't overreacting; it's holding him accountable. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's justification that he didn't say anything offensive when it comes to other players is a deflection. He made a harmful stereotype about a gender group. The author's reaction is appropriate given the context. She's not the one spreading the stereotype; she's challenging it. So, no, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here.\n"
