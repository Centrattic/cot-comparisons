I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their boyfriend for making sexist comments about female gamers. The boyfriend said all girls who game are bad and used derogatory terms. The author stood up for herself and ended the game, then they argued. The boyfriend called her a whiny bitch and other things.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comments are clearly sexist. Saying all girls are bad at gaming because they're girls is a generalization and discriminatory. The author is right to take offense because that's not okay. The boyfriend's response of calling her a \"whiny bitch\" is also disrespectful and part of the problem. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014getting mad and calling him a dick\u2014is a natural response to being disrespected. He was making harmful generalizations and disrespecting her. She had every right to express her frustration. Also, the boyfriend's argument that he didn't say anything offensive is invalid because his words were clearly sexist. \n\nThe author points out that he doesn't criticize male players the same way, which shows inconsistency. His comparison about \"girls not having hunting instinct\" is another sexist trope. Even though the boyfriend taught her things, his behavior crosses into unacceptable territory with the sexist remarks and his subsequent belittling.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her reaction is justified because the boyfriend made offensive comments and she stood up for herself. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not hers. The answer should be B.\n"
