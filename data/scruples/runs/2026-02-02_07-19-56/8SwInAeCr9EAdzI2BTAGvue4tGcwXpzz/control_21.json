I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend's comments about girls in gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend makes a generalization that all girls who game are bad and uses derogatory language (\"bitches\"). The author takes offense because she's a girl who games and she points out the sexism. He then calls her a \"whiny bitch\" and says she's not a \"female in the wild,\" implying she's an exception. The author stops playing, texts him, and calls him a \"dick\" a few times. The boyfriend argues he wasn't being offensive and brings up hunting instincts, which is another sexist stereotype.\n\nNow, the key points here: the boyfriend's statements are sexist, using gender to make judgments about skill, and using slurs. The author is standing up against that sexism. Even though she called him names, her reaction is in response to his offensive remarks. She also points out his inconsistency\u2014when bad players are male, he doesn't comment. \n\nThe boyfriend's defense that he didn't say anything offensive is weak because his statements clearly make a sweeping negative generalization about women. The author isn't overreacting to being called a \"bitch\" for playing; that's a direct sexist comment. Her frustration is valid because he's undermining her and other female gamers. Even though she called him names, it's in the context of his sexism, which is the root issue here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem. Generalizing about all women based on the actions of some is sexist, and the author is justified in confronting him. Her reaction is a valid response to his offensive comments, even if there's some back-and-forth. The answer should be B (No).\n"
