I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend making sexist remarks about girls in gaming, and the author getting upset and cutting off the game session.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comments: he said all girls who game are bad, used derogatory language like \"bitches,\" and made a comment about not having a \"hunting instinct.\" These are clear instances of sexist and disrespectful behavior. The author took offense, which is a reasonable reaction given the context.\n\nThe boyfriend then called her a \"whiny bitch\" and said she wasn't a \"female in the wild,\" implying she's an exception. He further claimed she took offense to something not offensive. The author's response was to stop playing and express her frustration, including calling him a \"dick\" and pointing out his sexism. She also mentioned that he's been supportive in teaching her games, but that doesn't negate his harmful comments.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overreacted. The boyfriend's statements are problematic and perpetuate negative stereotypes. The author's reaction is a valid response to being disrespected. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself and calling out his sexism. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not hers. Even if their communication escalated, his initial remarks were offensive, and her response was justified. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
