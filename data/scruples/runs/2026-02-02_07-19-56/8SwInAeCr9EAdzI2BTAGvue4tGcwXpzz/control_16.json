I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's boyfriend made a sexist comment about female gamers, saying all girls are bad and using derogatory language. The author got mad, asked if he thought she was bad, and he replied that she wouldn't be if she had him. They had a fight, and he called her a \"whiny bitch\" and other things. The author called him a \"dick\" and ended the gaming session.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author overreacted. The boyfriend's comments were clearly sexist and generalized. He used the term \"bitches\" and made a sweeping statement about all female players. The author taking offense isn't unreasonable because such statements are discriminatory. The boyfriend's follow-up comments, like saying she's not a \"female in the wild,\" further dehumanize her. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he didn't say anything offensive is problematic. Using derogatory language and making gender-based generalizations is offensive. The author pointing out the inconsistency\u2014why he doesn't comment on bad male players\u2014is valid. The boyfriend's response was dismissive and continued to be sexist.\n\nThe author's reaction, while emotional (calling him a dick), is a reasonable response to being belittled and faced with sexism. It's important to consider that defending against sexist remarks, even with strong language, is a form of self-advocacy. The boyfriend's behavior was the root cause here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's comments were the issue, and the author's reaction was a justified stand against his sexism. The key points are the use of sexist language, generalization, and the author's right to express discomfort. The boyfriend's actions were the main problem here.\n"
