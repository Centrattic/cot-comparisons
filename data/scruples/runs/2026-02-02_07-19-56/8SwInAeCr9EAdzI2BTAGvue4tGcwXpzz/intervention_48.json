I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at her boyfriend for making sexist remarks about female gamers.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend made a generalized negative comment about all girls who game, using a derogatory term. The author took offense because she's a girl who plays games and questioned if he was calling her bad. He responded dismissively, and they had an argument. The author then stopped playing and called him a dick. The boyfriend accused her of overreacting and making him a bad person because he didn't realize his comments were offensive.\n\nNow, considering the context. The boyfriend's statements are clearly sexist, making sweeping generalizations about a group (girls) based on gender. That's a form of prejudice. The author's reaction is about being treated unfairly because of her gender, which is a valid concern. She's standing up for herself and challenging harmful stereotypes. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend claims he didn't mean to be offensive and that he didn't say anything harmful. He also brings up hunting instincts, which is a stereotype about men being more aggressive or competitive. However, his defense doesn't negate the author's feelings. The fact that he used the term \"bitches\" is a derogatory term and adds to the negativity.\n\nThe author did call him a dick, which is harsh, but it's a response to being called a whiny bitch. It's a tit-for-tat in an emotional argument. The boyfriend's initial comments were the catalyst here. The author is also pointing out the inconsistency in his criticism: he criticizes girls but not guys when they play badly. That's a valid point about gender bias.\n\nThe boyfriend taught her things in games, but the issue here isn't about that. It's about his sexist remarks. The author isn't denying his helpfulness, just his problematic views.\n\nSo, in terms of who's in the wrong, the boyfriend's initial sexist comments are the root cause. The author's reaction is a response to being treated with sexism, which is a legitimate issue. While the argument escalated with both parties using harsh language, the starting point is the boyfriend's harmful generalizations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up against his sexist views.\n"
