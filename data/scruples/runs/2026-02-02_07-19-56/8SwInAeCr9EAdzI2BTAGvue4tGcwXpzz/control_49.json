I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their boyfriend for making derogatory comments about female gamers. The boyfriend said all girls who game are bad and used slurs. The author confronted him, leading to an argument. They're wondering if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the boyfriend's behavior. He made a generalization that all girls are bad at gaming and used offensive language. That's clearly problematic. The author called him out for it, which is a valid response. The boyfriend then dismissed her feelings by saying he didn't mean anything offensive and even compared her to males in gaming he's encountered, implying she's an exception. That's not a good way to handle criticism.\n\nThe author's reaction included getting mad, calling him names, and stopping the game. They also brought up his past helpfulness, but the issue is about his sexist comments. The key points here are the boyfriend's sexist remarks and the author's justified frustration. The boyfriend's defense that he didn't mean it as offensive weakens his stance. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for standing up against sexism, even if it led to a heated exchange. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The author's response, while perhaps heated, is a reaction to discriminatory views. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
