I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset with her boyfriend because he made a comment about all girls being bad at video games, specifically targeting a teammate with a \"girly\" username. She got mad, asked if he thought she was bad, and he responded that she wouldn't be if he was there. She stopped playing, they had a text argument where he called her a whiny bitch, and he didn't see why she was offended. She called him a dick a few times and told him to stop playing with her if she's so bad. He brought up something about hunting instincts, and she acknowledged he's helped her but disagrees with his comments.\n\nThe question is whether she overreacted. The user wants to know if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a generalization about all girls being bad at gaming and used derogatory language (\"bitches\"). That's clearly misogynistic and sexist. The author is justified in being upset because he's making a sweeping negative statement about her gender. His comment that she'd be bad too if not for him is dismissive and implies his superiority.\n\nHe also called her a \"whiny bitch\" when she expressed her feelings, which is abusive language. The fact that he didn't see why she took offense shows a lack of empathy and understanding of his own bias. She called him a dick in response, which is an emotional reaction but not unwarranted given his behavior.\n\nShe's standing up for herself and pointing out that he's making a sexist generalization. He's using stereotypes about gender differences (hunting instinct) which are baseless and used to justify discrimination. She's not overreacting because it's reasonable to be offended by sexist remarks, especially when they come from a partner.\n\nHe has a history of not making similar comments about male players, which shows his bias. She's pointing out the double standard, which is valid. Even though he's helped her in games, his comments are harmful and need to be addressed. The author is in the right to express her discomfort and set boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. The boyfriend is in the wrong for making sexist remarks and being dismissive, and the author is not in the wrong for standing up for herself.\n"
