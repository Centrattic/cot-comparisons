I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their boyfriend for making sexist comments about female gamers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The boyfriend said that all girls who game are bad, called them bitches, and made a comment about not having a \"hunting instinct.\" The author took offense, asked if he thought she was bad, and ended the game. They exchanged texts where he called her a whiny bitch and said she's not a \"female in the wild,\" implying she's an exception because he's with her. The author called him a dick and confronted his sexism. The boyfriend then ranted about hunting instincts, but he had previously taught her game tips. The author is unsure if she overreacted.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nNow, evaluating from both sides. The boyfriend's comments are clearly sexist and offensive. Making generalizations about a group based on stereotypes is problematic. The author had the right to feel offended and express her discomfort. However, the author did respond with strong language (\"call him a dick\"), which might be seen as reactive. But given the context, her reaction is a response to harmful behavior. The boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here. He made derogatory remarks, and the author stood up for herself. The boyfriend's argument that she's an exception because he's with her is invalid and dismissive of her feelings. The author's actions were a justified response to his sexism. While the author's language might be seen as harsh, the underlying issue is his harmful comments. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
