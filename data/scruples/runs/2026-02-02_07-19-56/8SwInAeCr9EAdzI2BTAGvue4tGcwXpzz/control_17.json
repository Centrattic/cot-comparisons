I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their boyfriend making a sexist comment about female gamers. He said all girls who play games are bad and used a derogatory term. The author got mad and confronted him, which led to an argument. He called her a \"whiny bitch\" and made some comments about her not being a \"female in the wild,\" which I guess is a video game term for a female player. They had a back-and-forth where he didn't seem to acknowledge his part in the issue and instead dismissed her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend made a generalized negative statement about all women in gaming and used a slur. The author responded by questioning his views and pointing out the inconsistency, since he didn't make similar comments about male players. She called him a \"dick\" a couple of times, but that's probably not the main issue. The boyfriend escalated the conflict by calling her names and bringing up his own views about women not having a hunting instinct, which sounds like more sexism. The author is defensive about her reaction, saying she's justified because she finds the comments offensive and he's being sexist.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The main factors here are the boyfriend's sexist remarks and the author's response. If someone makes a derogatory and sexist statement, it's reasonable for the other person to express their discomfort or disagreement. The boyfriend's comments are problematic because they generalize and stereotype, which is a form of sexism. The author's response, while heated (calling him a dick), is a reaction to his offensive statements. She's pointing out his inconsistency and the issue with his comments, which is a valid response. The boyfriend, in turn, is dismissing her feelings and doubling down on his views, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's standing up against sexism. Her reaction is a natural response to being offensive remarks, even if the exchange got heated. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning here. He's making harmful generalizations and not taking responsibility, which is worse. The author is justified in her feelings and actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
