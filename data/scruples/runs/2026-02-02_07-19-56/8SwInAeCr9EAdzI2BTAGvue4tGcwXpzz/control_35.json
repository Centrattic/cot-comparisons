I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend making a sexist comment about girls in gaming. The boyfriend says all girls who game are bad and uses derogatory language. The author confronts him, he responds disrespectfully, and they argue. The author calls him a \"dick\" and ends the game session. Then the boyfriend claims she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author overreacted. The boyfriend made a generalization based on gender, which is a clear instance of sexism. The author is justified in being upset because such statements are not only offensive but also perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The boyfriend's use of the word \"bitches\" is particularly derogatory. \n\nThe author's response includes questioning if he thinks she's bad, which shows she's challenging his sexist remarks. His reply that she's not bad because she has him is condescending and dismissive. The fact that the boyfriend then calls her a \"whiny bitch\" and makes a joke about her not being a \"female in the wild\" is further evidence of his disrespect.\n\nThe author also points out the inconsistency in his criticism, noting that he doesn't make similar comments about male players. This highlights his double standard. The author's frustration and subsequent actions (calling him a dick, ending the game) are reasonable given the toxic behavior she's facing. \n\nWhile the author did use some strong language (\"call him a dick\"), it's a reaction to his sexist and disrespectful comments. The boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here. The author's response is a valid stand against sexism, and she's not wrong for taking offense. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions and statements are the problematic part. The author's reaction is a justified response to his sexism and disrespect.\n"
