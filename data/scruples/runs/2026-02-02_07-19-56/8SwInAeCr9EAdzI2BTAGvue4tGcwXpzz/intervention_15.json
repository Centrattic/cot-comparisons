I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about the author getting angry at her boyfriend for making sexist remarks about female gamers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The boyfriend made a comment that all girls who game are bad, used derogatory terms like \"bitches,\" and generalized based on a teammate's girly username. The author felt offended, challenged his statement, and they had a falling out. She mentions calling him a \"dick\" and confronting his sexism. He, in turn, accused her of being a \"whiny bitch.\"\n\nThe question is whether she overreacted. The user initially thought she might be in the wrong but is unsure. Let me break it down.\n\nSexism is a serious issue, and making generalized negative statements about a group based on gender is discriminatory. The boyfriend's remarks are clearly sexist, and the author standing up for herself is a valid reaction. He made a harmful stereotype, which is offensive regardless of the context. The author isn't just being sensitive here; she's pointing out a problematic attitude. \n\nHe also brought up her gender in a derogatory way (\"you would be if you didn't have me\") and later made a comment about hunting instincts, which adds to the toxic behavior. The fact that she challenged him is reasonable. His response (\"whiny bitch\") is disrespectful, which probably escalated the conflict. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014ending the game, expressing her frustration, and calling him out for his sexism\u2014are justified. Using the term \"dick\" is a strong reaction, but given the context, it's a common expression of frustration and doesn't seem unwarranted. \n\nHe has a history of making negative comments about women in gaming, which isn't excused by the fact that he's helped her learn the games. The author's reaction is about addressing the harmful behavior, not about being petty. \n\nSo, in this case, the boyfriend's behavior was problematic and sexist, and the author's reaction is a valid response to that. She isn't in the wrong for standing up against his comments. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
