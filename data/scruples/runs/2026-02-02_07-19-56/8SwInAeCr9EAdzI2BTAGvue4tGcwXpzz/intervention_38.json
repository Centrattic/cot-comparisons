I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their boyfriend for making sexist comments during a game. The boyfriend said all girls who game are bad, used derogatory terms, and made a comment about the author not being a \"female in the wild.\" The author felt offended, stopped playing, and called him a dick a few times. They also pointed out that the boyfriend generalized all female gamers, which is a form of sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend made offensive remarks based on gender, which is clearly problematic. His comments were not just about the teammate but generalized all girls, which is a stereotype. The author took offense, which is valid because such statements can be hurtful and discriminatory. The boyfriend's defense that he didn't mean it as an offensive comment might not hold up because the impact of his words matters, regardless of intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did call the boyfriend a dick multiple times and ended the interaction. They might have overreacted in terms of the response, but the initial offense is rooted in his sexist remarks. The author's reaction is a response to the boyfriend's harmful comments, so it's hard to say they're entirely at fault. The boyfriend's behavior started the conflict, and the author's frustration stems from being treated with disrespect and sexism. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the boyfriend has been helpful in the past, but that doesn't excuse his comments. The key issue here is the boyfriend's sexist attitude and the author standing up for themselves. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset by sexist remarks, even if their response included some harsh language. The main problem lies with the boyfriend's comments, not the author's reaction to them. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
