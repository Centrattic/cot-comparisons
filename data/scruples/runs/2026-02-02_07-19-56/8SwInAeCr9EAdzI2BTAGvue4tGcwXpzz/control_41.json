I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the boyfriend making a comment about all girls being bad at gaming because a teammate had a \"girly\" username. The author took offense, asked if he thought she was bad, and he replied that he wouldn't because she has him. Then the conversation escalated with him calling her names like \"whiny bitch\" and bringing up stereotypes like women lacking a hunting instinct. The author called him a dick and ended the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author overreacted. The boyfriend made a generalization about all girls being bad at gaming based on the gender of a teammate. That's a stereotype and can be considered sexist. The author pointed out that he's applying this standard only to women, not men, which is valid. His response that she wouldn't be bad because she has him implies that her gaming ability is only good because of him, which is condescending. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable because the boyfriend's comments are discriminatory. He went further by calling her a \"whiny bitch\" and making more sexist remarks, which makes his behavior worse. Even though the author called him names, she had reason to be upset. The key point is that the boyfriend made a sexist statement, and the author stood up for herself. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The boyfriend's comments were the root issue, and her response was a reaction to his sexist remarks. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
