I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend making sexist comments about female gamers, and the author getting mad and stopping the game. The boyfriend called the author a \"whiny bitch\" and made other offensive remarks. The author called him a \"dick\" and ended the game.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend is making a generalization that all girls who game are bad, which is sexist. He refers to girls as bitches, which is disrespectful. The author points out that he's being sexist and that his comments are uncalled for. The boyfriend's response is to call her names and dismiss her concerns, saying she's not a \"female in the wild\" which is confusing and probably minimizing her feelings.\n\nThe author's reaction includes getting angry, stopping the game, and calling him a dick a few times. She also confronts him about the sexism. The boyfriend has taught her some gaming skills, so there's some positive aspect, but his comments are clearly problematic.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now seeking opinions. The main question is whether the author overreacted. In terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's comments are the root issue here. He's making sexist remarks, using derogatory language, and then dismissing her valid concerns. The author is defending her position and expressing her discomfort, which is a reasonable response to being called names and subjected to sexist comments.\n\nCalling someone a \"dick\" a few times in the context of being insulted and dismissed might be a strong reaction, but given the boyfriend's behavior, it's not entirely unwarranted. The author is standing up for herself against sexist behavior, which is important. The boyfriend's response of calling her a \"whiny bitch\" is clearly inappropriate and shows a lack of respect. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. She took offense to his sexist remarks, which is valid. The boyfriend's generalization about women players and his derogatory language are offensive. The author is not wrong for being upset by that. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, so the author's reaction, while perhaps heated, is a response to his wrongdoing. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
