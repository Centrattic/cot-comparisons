I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry when her boyfriend made sexist remarks about female gamers. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a generalization that all girls who game are bad and used derogatory terms like \"bitches.\" The author took offense because she's a girl who games, and he even implied that she's not bad because he's there. That's a clear double standard. He's applying a negative stereotype specifically to women in gaming, which is a form of sexism.\n\nThen, after the argument, the boyfriend called her a \"whiny bitch\" and mentioned she's not a \"female in the wild,\" which seems dismissive and degrading. The author's response included calling him a \"dick,\" which is understandable in the heat of the moment. However, she also stood her ground by pointing out his sexist views, which he dismissed by comparing it to how he doesn't target male players. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's initial sexist remarks and the author's justified reaction. She's not overreacting to being called a \"bitch\" or to his generalizations. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author is correct in pointing out his sexism. While both might have escalated the conversation with harsh words, the root issue is his sexist comments. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up to that.\n"
