I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a boyfriend making a sexist comment during a gaming session, and the author getting upset and ending the session.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. The boyfriend criticized a female player's gaming skills, generalizing all girls as bad. The author took offense because he was making a sexist remark and even implied that she was bad because he was there. Then he called her a \"whiny bitch\" and made a comment about her not being a \"female in the wild,\" which is a bit unclear but seems to dehumanize her. The author responded by calling him a \"dick,\" which she admits, but she also points out that he made multiple sexist remarks. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's sexist generalizations and the author's reaction. The boyfriend is making a sweeping negative statement about an entire gender based on the behavior of one individual. That's a classic example of stereotyping and sexism. The author's frustration is justified because such comments are offensive and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. \n\nThe boyfriend's response to her taking offense is dismissive and rude. By calling her names and denying that he said anything offensive, he's not only invalidating her feelings but also escalating the conflict. The author's reaction includes expressing her disagreement, calling him out for his sexism, and ending the session, which are reasonable responses to being disrespected. \n\nHe also mentions that he taught her things in the game, which she appreciates, but the issue here is about the sexist comments. The fact that he has been supportive in other aspects doesn't negate the sexism in this instance. \n\nThe author did call him names, but given the context of being called derogatory terms by him, her response is a reaction to his behavior, not just an overreaction. She's standing up for herself against his sexist remarks. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the boyfriend made sexist comments, dismissed her feelings, and used sexist language. The author responded by expressing her discomfort and stopping the interaction. Her reaction is a valid response to being treated disrespectfully. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
