I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their boyfriend for making sexist comments about female gamers. So the boyfriend said something like all girls who game are bad, referred to them as bitches, and then tried to justify it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a generalization based on gender, which is a classic example of sexism. The author took offense because they are a female gamer, and they felt targeted. The boyfriend's comments were derogatory and generalized, which is definitely problematic. The author's response was to stop playing and express their frustration, which seems like a reasonable reaction to offensive speech.\n\nThen, the boyfriend called the author a \"whiny bitch\" and said they aren't a \"female in the wild,\" which implies that as long as the author isn't in a certain category (maybe not a competitive player?), they don't count. That's dismissive and invalidates the author's feelings. The boyfriend also complained that the author took offense where there wasn't any, which is incorrect because the comments were clearly offensive.\n\nThe author did call the boyfriend a \"dick\" a couple of times, but that's a common expression of frustration and doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The boyfriend also didn't acknowledge that his comments were sexist, instead bringing up more stereotypes about hunting instincts. The author was justified in pointing out the sexism and setting boundaries.\n\nConsidering all that, the boyfriend's behavior was the root of the problem. The author's reaction was a valid response to being treated with sexist remarks. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
