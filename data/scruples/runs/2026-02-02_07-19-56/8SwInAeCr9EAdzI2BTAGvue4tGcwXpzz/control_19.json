I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.\n\nI decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.\nHe complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.\nI told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many \"bad\" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. \nHe has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.\nWhat do you guys think, did I overreact? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The main issue here is the boyfriend's comment about girls being bad at gaming and using derogatory language.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend makes a generalization about all girls being bad at games, calls them bitches, and compares the author to other players he's played with. The author takes offense, which leads to an argument where he calls her a whiny bitch and makes more sexist remarks. The author then calls him a dick a few times and ends the conversation.\n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend's sexist remarks, the author's response, and whether her reaction was justified. The question is if the author is in the wrong (option A) or not (option B).\n\nThe boyfriend is making a harmful generalization based on gender, which is a form of sexism. Using derogatory terms like \"bitches\" is definitely inappropriate. The author is upset because he's making a sweeping statement that affects her as well. She confronts him, and he doubles down, calling her names and making more sexist comments. Her response of calling him a \"dick\" a few times is a common reaction to being insulted, and it's not uncommon for people to say that in an argument. She also sets a boundary by saying she won't play with him if he's treating her that way. \n\nHe claims she's overreacting, but the fact that he made a sexist statement and then insults her shows that he's at fault here. The author isn't wrong for standing up for herself and expressing her feelings. The boyfriend's behavior is the root of the issue. While the author did use some strong language, it was in response to his insults. The situation involves the boyfriend violating the author's boundaries with his sexist remarks, and the author defending herself. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are problematic, and her reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
