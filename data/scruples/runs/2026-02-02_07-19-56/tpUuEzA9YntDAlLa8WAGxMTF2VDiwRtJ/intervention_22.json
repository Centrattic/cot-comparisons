She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's also 21. She had a really tough upbringing\u2014abusive parents, anti-vaxxers, conservative, religious, sent to a school with harmful propaganda. She was a gymnast and suffered from body image issues and an eating disorder. Now in college, she's trying to educate herself and take control of her health, but the author finds her naive. He called her naive after a conversation about fitness where she expressed concerns about getting bulky, which he attributes to her coaches lying to her. She got upset, and he feels bad for lashing out but is frustrated.\n\nSo, the question is, is he in the wrong for calling her naive? The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has a history of trauma and manipulation. She's working on overcoming the negative messages she received. The author seems to understand the background but still calls her naive, which could be dismissive of her struggles. His frustration is valid, but his approach might not be. Telling someone they're naive can come off as condescending, especially when they're dealing with the aftermath of abuse and trying to rebuild their self-image. The girlfriend is in a process of unlearning harmful teachings, which takes time. The author's comment might invalidate her efforts and make her feel like she's not making progress, which could be hurtful.\n\nHowever, he's also trying to help her see the truth and might genuinely be concerned. But instead of being supportive, he's using a term that's critical. The key here is how he delivered his concern. If he's not being supportive and is instead belittling her, that's where he might be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the term \"na\u00efve\" is hurtful, even if her coaches were indeed lying. She's vulnerable and working through a lot, so being called naive could undermine her confidence.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to be harsh, but the choice of words matters. It's possible he's not recognizing her efforts and growth, which is important. The answer would hinge on whether the criticism was constructive and delivered with empathy. Since he lashed out and used a term that implies she's foolish or lacking in judgment, which isn't helpful in this context, that points towards him being in the wrong. He needs to approach her struggles with more patience and support rather than frustration and criticism.\n"
