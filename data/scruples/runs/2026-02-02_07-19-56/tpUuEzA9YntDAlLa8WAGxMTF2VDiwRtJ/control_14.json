She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe guy is 21, his girlfriend is also 21. She has a really tough background: abusive parents, anti-vaxxers, conservative religious, sent her to a school with harmful propaganda. Coaches made her feel bad about her body. Now she's trying to be more liberal and take control of her health, but she's still struggling with body image and doesn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her.\n\nHe got frustrated when she said she was worried about getting bulky from lifting, and he called her na\u00efve. She got upset because he's not letting her take time to unlearn her past. He feels she's clueless about obvious things even though she's smart academically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if calling someone na\u00efve in this context is wrong. He's trying to help, but maybe he's not considering her trauma. She's dealing with a lot of ingrained beliefs from her past, so it's hard for her to see things differently. He's being impatient, not giving her the time she needs to process and heal. \n\nHe's frustrated because he can't understand why she can't see things clearly, but her background makes it so that she's been conditioned to accept harmful things. His comment might have come off as dismissive of her experiences and the progress she's making. Even if his intentions are good, the way he expressed his frustration could be hurtful. \n\nHe might not realize that his criticism could trigger her past experiences, making her feel attacked like her coaches did. She's trying to unlearn a lot, and his outburst might set her back. So, in this case, he's not in the wrong in wanting to help, but his approach is problematic. The key is whether his actions were supportive or not. Since he lashed out and called her na\u00efve, which she's working hard to overcome, that's where the issue is. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not being supportive and is dismissing her struggles instead of being patient and understanding.\n"
