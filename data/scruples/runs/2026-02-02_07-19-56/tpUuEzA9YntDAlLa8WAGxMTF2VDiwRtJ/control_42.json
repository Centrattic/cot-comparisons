She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" is in the wrong. Let's go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a really traumatic background. Her parents were abusive, stole from her, and were anti-vaxxers. She was in a school with harmful teachings and had coaches who made her feel bad about her body, leading to an eating disorder. Now she's in college, trying to educate herself and take control of her health.\n\nThe author is frustrated because she doesn't see the abuse she went through as abuse until he told her. He finds it obvious that her parents' actions were abusive and her coaches were lying. He called her na\u00efve when she expressed concerns about lifting weights, referencing her past coaches' negative comments.\n\nThe key points here are about her upbringing and how it affected her perception. She's working to undo the damage from her past, which is a lot to process. The author might not realize how ingrained those negative beliefs are for her. Calling her na\u00efve might come off as dismissive of her struggles. Even though he's trying to help, his frustration could be making him overlook the emotional labor she's going through.\n\nShe's trying to rebuild her self-image and understanding of the world. It's possible that her slow progress is due to deep-seated trauma, not just lack of awareness. The author's reaction might be impatience with her healing process. He might not be in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but the way he expressed it could be harmful. The term \"na\u00efve\" might be triggering or invalidating her experiences, even if he meant it as a push for her to see the truth.\n\nSo, considering her background and the sensitivity required in such situations, the author might be in the wrong for not being more empathetic and understanding of her challenges. He should approach the situation with more compassion and support rather than frustration.\n"
