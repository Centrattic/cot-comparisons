She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a guy who's 21 and his girlfriend is also 21. She had a really tough upbringing with abusive parents who were anti-vax and conservative. They sent her to a religious school where she was exposed to harmful ideologies. Plus, her gymnastics coaches made her feel bad about her body, leading to eating disorders.\n\nNow, the author is frustrated because he feels she's na\u00efve. For example, he told her her parents were abusive, which she didn't realize before, and he's upset that she still believes some of the negative things her coaches said. He called her na\u00efve in a conversation about fitness, which upset her. She's trying to unlearn all the bad stuff from her past, but he finds it frustrating that she's not seeing things as clearly as he does.\n\nSo the question is: is the author wrong for calling her na\u00efve? Let's break it down. First, consider her background. She's had significant trauma and manipulation. People who grow up in such environments might internalize harmful beliefs, making it hard to recognize abuse or manipulation later. Her being in college and trying to educate herself shows she's working on it, but healing and unlearning take time. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it might be the problem. Calling someone na\u00efve can be dismissive, especially when the person has a history of being manipulated. It might invalidate her struggles and make her feel like her efforts to improve are not being acknowledged. Instead of pointing out her naivety, a more supportive approach might be better, like validating her experiences while gently guiding her towards new perspectives.\n\nAlso, the example about the coaches and body image: she's still struggling with body dysmorphia, which is a result of past trauma. The author's response, while factually correct, might not be compassionate enough. She's dealing with deep-seated issues, and a harsh comment can trigger her insecurities. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships, especially when one partner has a history of trauma. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" for feeling frustrated, but the way he expressed that frustration could be harmful. He needs to balance honesty with empathy. So, the answer might hinge on whether the criticism was constructive and considerate of her past. Since he lashed out and used the term \"na\u00efve\" which she found upsetting, it's possible he's in the wrong. But maybe there's nuance here. Maybe he's trying to help, but the method is flawed. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at intent, impact, and context. The impact here is that she got upset. The intent was to help her see the truth, but the method wasn't supportive. Considering the context of her trauma, the impact is significant. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more understanding in his approach.\n"
