She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy calling his girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" because of her not recognizing abuse and certain body image issues from her past. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend had a very traumatic upbringing with abusive parents who were anti-vaxxers and taught her harmful things. Her coaches also gave her a bad body image. She's trying to educate herself now, but the guy feels frustrated because she doesn't see things as obvious as he does.\n\nThe key points here are: Was the guy's reaction appropriate? He called her na\u00efve, which she took as an insult. She's in the process of healing from trauma, so maybe his frustration is misplaced. He's in a position where he should be supportive, but his comments might be dismissive of her struggles. \n\nHe says she's \"clueless\" and \"na\u00efve,\" which could be seen as invalidating her experiences. Just because something is obvious to him doesn't mean it's obvious to her, given her background. People with trauma might internalize negative messages deeply, so it takes time to rewire those thoughts. His frustration is valid, but the way he expressed it might be unkind. \n\nAlso, the example about the gym comment: Her coaches told her she'd get bulky easily, and he told her they were lying. While he's right, pointing out that her coaches manipulated her might come off as harsh. It's important to acknowledge her feelings without dismissing her past experiences.\n\nSo, in terms of AITA: The man might be in the wrong if his approach wasn't supportive and understanding. He should consider that healing takes time and that his girlfriend is working on overcoming her past. Being patient and helping her instead of criticizing her for not being \"aware\" quickly enough could be the better approach. Therefore, the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
