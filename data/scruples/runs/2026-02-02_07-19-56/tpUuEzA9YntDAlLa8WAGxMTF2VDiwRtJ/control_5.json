She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend na\u00efve.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The girlfriend has a history of abuse and manipulation from her parents and coaches. She's trying to unlearn a lot of harmful stuff. The boyfriend finds her reactions and beliefs na\u00efve, especially regarding her body image and her parents' behavior. He called her out on it, which made her upset.\n\nNow, considering her background: she was in an abusive environment for a long time. Her parents stole money, were verbally abusive, and her coaches told her she was fat. She's working on overcoming anorexia and body dysmorphia. She's also in a new stage of life, college, where she's trying to be more open-minded.\n\nThe boyfriend's frustration is understandable. He sees things she's struggling with as obvious, but she's coming from a place of trauma. It's possible he's not being patient enough. Using the term \"na\u00efve\" might come off as dismissive of her experiences. He might be underestimating how deeply ingrained her parents' and coaches' teachings were, and how hard it is to change those beliefs.\n\nHe did lash out, even if he feels bad about it. The key here is whether he's in the wrong for calling her na\u00efve. Since he's trying to help her see the truth, but his approach might be too harsh given her history, it's possible he's not considering the emotional impact. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being supportive enough and is dismissing her struggles.\n"
