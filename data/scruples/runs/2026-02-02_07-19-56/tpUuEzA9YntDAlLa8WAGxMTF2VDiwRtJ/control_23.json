She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling his girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" and getting upset when she doesn't see things as clearly as he does. The girlfriend has a history of abuse, manipulation, and harmful upbringing. The author is frustrated with her not recognizing these issues and her body image issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was raised in an abusive environment where she was told negative things about herself. She's trying to overcome that now. The author is pointing out that her coaches were lying to her, but she still holds onto those beliefs because they were ingrained for so long. \n\nThe key here is whether calling someone \"na\u00efve\" is wrong in this context. The author might think he's helping her see the truth, but his approach could be dismissive of her trauma and the time it takes to heal. He's frustrated, which is understandable, but how he expresses that might be the issue. \n\nThe girlfriend is in the process of unlearning harmful teachings. It's possible that the author's frustration and the way he called her na\u00efve could be invalidating her experiences. Even if his intentions are good, the delivery might be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author might not be considering how his words affect her. She's already dealing with significant emotional and psychological challenges. Being told she's na\u00efve in a critical way might make her feel criticized instead of supported. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to help her see the reality of her past, which is a good intention. However, the method of communication is crucial here. Instead of labeling her as na\u00efve, maybe a more compassionate approach would be better. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because his frustration led him to dismiss her struggles, and he didn't approach the situation with enough empathy and understanding.\n"
