She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about calling his girlfriend na\u00efve.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend had a very traumatic upbringing: abusive parents, anti-vax, conservative, religious, and she was in a sport where coaches told her she was fat. Now she's in college, trying to become more liberal and informed. But the boyfriend finds her na\u00efve because she didn't realize her parents were abusive and still believes some things from her gymnastics coaches.\n\nThe key points here are her background and the boyfriend's reaction. He called her na\u00efve after she expressed concern about getting bulky from lifting, which her coaches had previously told her. He told her the coaches were lying to make her feel bad. She got upset but says she's working on undoing the past influences.\n\nNow, is he wrong for calling her that? Well, given her history, her naivety might stem from being manipulated and not having the right information. The boyfriend seems frustrated that she's not seeing things clearly, but he might be underestimating the impact of her upbringing. He might be impatient with her progress in overcoming those issues. \n\nCalling someone na\u00efve can be hurtful, especially if they're already dealing with low self-esteem and body image issues. Even if his intentions were to correct her, the way he expressed it might have been harsh. The fact that she's trying to learn and unlearn things suggests that she's aware of her past and working on it. The boyfriend might not be considering the emotional labor she's going through.\n\nOn the other hand, he's concerned and wants to help, but his approach might need to be more empathetic. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being critical. Since her naivety is a result of her traumatic experiences, it's not her fault. The boyfriend could be in the wrong for not being patient and for blaming her for something beyond her control. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's criticizing her for being na\u00efve, which is a result of her upbringing rather than her own fault. He should be more supportive and understanding given her background.\n"
