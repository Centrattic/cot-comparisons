She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend had a very traumatic upbringing: abusive parents, anti-vaxxers, sent to a school with harmful propaganda, and coaches who body-shamed her. Now in college, she's trying to educate herself on these issues but is still struggling to see the abuse she endured. The author is frustrated that she can't recognize these things as abuse or harmful, leading to a conversation where he calls her na\u00efve. She got upset and is working on undoing the damage from her past.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's history of trauma and the author's frustration. The author is clearly concerned, but his approach might be too harsh. He's pointing out things she's unaware of, but given her background, it's not surprising she hasn't recognized these issues yet. He's using the term \"na\u00efve,\" which can come off as dismissive or belittling, especially when someone is still healing and learning. \n\nThe girlfriend is making progress, like getting vaccinated and managing her health, which shows she's trying. The author's frustration is valid, but his method of calling her na\u00efve might not be the best way to support her. It's important to consider that trauma can affect one's perception and that healing takes time. The author might need to approach the situation with more empathy and patience instead of frustration.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be good, his actions are causing harm. He's in the wrong because he's not considering the depth of her trauma and how his words might impact her healing process.\n"
