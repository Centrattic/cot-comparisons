She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve.\" The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a really tough background. Her parents were abusive, stole from her, and were anti-vax, conservative, and religious. She was sent to a school that spread racist, homophobic, and sexist ideas. Plus, her gymnastics coaches made her feel fat and disgusting. Now, she's in college, vaccinated, and trying to educate herself on liberal topics. But she still struggles with body image and doesn't see the abuse her parents inflicted.\n\nThe author is frustrated because she's not recognizing these issues as abnormal. He called her na\u00efve after she expressed concerns about getting bulky, leading to an argument. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, why might the author be wrong (A)? He's criticizing her for not seeing things clearly, but given her traumatic upbringing, it's possible she's still processing all that. She's trying to unlearn harmful teachings, which takes time. Calling her na\u00efve might be dismissive of her struggles and invalidating. It could be seen as not respecting her healing process. He might be projecting his own understanding onto her, not considering how trauma affects perception.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong (B). He's expressing frustration because he sees things clearly, and it's hard to watch someone he cares about not see them. He's trying to help, even if his approach is rough. Maybe his intentions are good, but the method is poor. However, the term \"na\u00efve\" can come off as condescending, especially in a relationship where there's a power dynamic. He might be impatient and not giving her enough credit for the progress she's making.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of trauma and how it affects someone's ability to recognize abuse or manipulation. People raised in such environments might internalize the messages they received, making it hard to see the abuse as abuse. The author might not fully understand the psychological impact of her upbringing, leading him to misinterpret her confusion as naivety rather than a result of trauma.\n\nAdditionally, the comment about the coaches lying to her could be triggering. If she's still struggling with body image issues, directly accusing her coaches of lying might reopen wounds. It's important to approach such topics with sensitivity, not just bluntly calling someone na\u00efve.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters. Even if the author's intentions are to help, the way he communicates his frustration can cause harm. The term \"na\u00efve\" can feel like an insult, making her feel defensive instead of supported. It's possible he's not considering her emotional state when he makes such comments, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author is also trying to support her by pointing out the manipulative behavior she experienced. The line between helpful criticism and condescension is thin here. Without understanding the depth of her trauma, his words might not be as constructive as he intends.\n\nIn summary, the key factors are the girlfriend's traumatic background, the author's frustration, and the communication approach. The author's use of the term \"na\u00efve\" might be dismissive of her ongoing healing process and the complex effects of her upbringing. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more empathy and understanding.\n"
