She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. The situation involves a lot of backstory about the girlfriend's upbringing and current struggles. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had a really tough childhood with abusive parents and coaches who were manipulative. Her parents are anti-vax and conservative, and she's now trying to unlearn all that. The boyfriend is frustrated because she doesn't see the obvious issues in her past, like her parents being abusive or their coaches lying about her body.\n\nThe key here is whether calling her na\u00efve is the right approach. The boyfriend points out that she's \"clueless\" about things that seem obvious to him. But given her traumatic background, maybe she's still in the process of recognizing these things. She's trying to undo years of manipulation, which takes time and support, not criticism.\n\nHe used the word \"na\u00efve\" in a situation where she's still healing. Even if she's making progress, pointing out her naivety might come across as dismissive of her struggles. The fact that she got upset and he felt bad after lashing out suggests that his approach might not be helpful. \n\nHe might be right that she's missing things because of her upbringing, but the way he's addressing it could be damaging. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, maybe he should be more patient and help her work through her issues without judgment. So, yes, he's in the wrong for not being supportive and for invalidating her efforts to recover from her past.\n"
