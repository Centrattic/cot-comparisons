She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. The situation involves a lot of background about the girlfriend's upbringing. She had abusive parents, anti-vax, conservative, religious, and she was in a Christian school that taught harmful ideologies. She was also manipulated by her gymnastics coaches into thinking she was fat, leading to an eating disorder. Now in college, she's trying to be more liberal and proactive about her health.\n\nThe key here is that the boyfriend is frustrated with her not recognizing the abuse she went through and her current misconceptions, like thinking she's too bulky when she's naturally lean. He calls her na\u00efve, which leads to her getting upset. He acknowledges she's trying to undo the harmful teachings but finds it hard to understand her lack of awareness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if calling someone na\u00efve is the right approach. The girlfriend's background is filled with trauma and manipulation. Her not realizing her parents were abusive until now is a result of those manipulative environments. The boyfriend might feel frustrated, but his approach of labeling her as na\u00efve could be dismissive of her experiences. He's pointing out obvious things, but for someone who's been conditioned to believe certain things, it's not that simple. She's in the process of unlearning, which takes time and support, not criticism.\n\nAlso, the example with the gym conversation: her coaches told her lies about her body, and she still internalizes that. The boyfriend's frustration is valid in a way, but his response might not be helpful. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, approaching it with patience and support might be better. He says he's trying to undo the teachings, but his method here seems to be judgment, which could hinder her progress.\n\nIn terms of the question: Is the author in the wrong? The answer would likely be A (Yes) because he's not considering her trauma and the time it takes to unlearn harmful beliefs. His frustration is understandable, but the way he's responding (labeling her as na\u00efve) is dismissive and could be damaging. The right approach would be to be more supportive, even if he's frustrated with her progress.\n"
