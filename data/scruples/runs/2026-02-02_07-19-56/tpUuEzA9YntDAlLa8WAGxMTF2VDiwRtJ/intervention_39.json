She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend na\u00efve. The situation involves a lot of background about her difficult upbringing and the challenges she's facing. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a traumatic childhood with abusive parents, anti-vaxxers, and a conservative, religious environment. She was also mistreated in gymnastics, which led to an eating disorder and body image issues. Now in college, she's trying to educate herself and make positive changes, like getting vaccinated and managing her reproductive health.\n\nThe author's frustration comes from the girlfriend not recognizing the abuse she endured and still believing negative things about herself, like her body image. The specific incident was the author calling her na\u00efve when she was worried about getting bulky from lifting, which the author believed was due to her coaches' manipulation.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's girlfriend has faced significant trauma and is in the process of healing and learning new perspectives. 2) The author is expressing frustration with her inability to see things as he does, which he considers obvious. 3) The term \"na\u00efve\" is used in a context where her experiences may have limited her understanding of certain things.\n\nI need to consider whether calling someone na\u00efve in this context is wrong. The author's intention might be to correct her and help her see the truth, but the way he's doing it could be harmful. The girlfriend is already vulnerable and trying to overcome deep-seated issues. Labeling her as na\u00efve might invalidate her experiences and efforts to heal. It could also be seen as dismissive of the trauma she's endured, which affects her perception and self-image.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if his intention is to support her growth. However, the way he's communicating his frustration (calling her na\u00efve) could be unhelpful. It's possible that he's not considering the emotional impact of his words. The girlfriend is working on undoing years of harmful teachings, which is a complex process. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might be counterproductive.\n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have trauma, communication is crucial. Instead of labeling her as na\u00efve, the author should approach the situation with empathy and patience. The use of \"na\u00efve\" might come off as condescending, making her feel criticized rather than supported. This could hinder her progress and strain their relationship.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not acknowledging the challenges his girlfriend faces and is using language that could be hurtful and dismissive of her healing process.\n"
