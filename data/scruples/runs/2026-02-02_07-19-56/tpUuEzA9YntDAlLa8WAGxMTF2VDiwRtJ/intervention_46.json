She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a really traumatic background. Her parents were abusive, stole money, and were anti-vaxxers. She was in a conservative environment and sent to a school that taught harmful ideologies. Also, her gymnastics coaches body-shamed her, leading to an eating disorder and body dysmorphia. Now she's in college, trying to educate herself and make healthier choices, but she's still struggling with the effects of her past.\n\nThe boyfriend is frustrated because he feels she's too na\u00efve. He points out that she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her, and she still believes the negative things her coaches said about her body. He called her na\u00efve, which upset her. She's trying to work through her trauma, but it's a slow process.\n\nThe key here is understanding the context. The girlfriend's naivety is a result of her upbringing and the trauma she's experienced. She's in the process of healing and unlearning harmful messages. The boyfriend's frustration is valid, but the way he reacted might not be considerate of her struggles. Calling someone na\u00efve in this context could be dismissive of her past and the challenges she's facing. It's important to recognize that healing takes time, and she's doing the best she can with the experiences she has.\n\nThe boyfriend might not be \"in the wrong\" in the sense that his frustration is understandable, but his approach could be more empathetic. The question is whether his actions were wrong. Since he labeled her as na\u00efve without acknowledging her efforts to overcome her upbringing, it's possible he's not being supportive enough. The answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's not considering her perspective and trauma, which is a significant factor in her behavior.\n"
