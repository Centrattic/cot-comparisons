She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend na\u00efve in this situation. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, his girlfriend had a really tough upbringing. Her parents were abusive, stole from her, and were anti-vaxxers and conservative, which led to exposure to harmful propaganda. Plus, her gymnastics coaches made her feel bad about her body, leading to eating disorders. She's now in college, vaccinated, and trying to educate herself but still has issues like body dysmorphia and anorexia.\n\nThe author is frustrated because she doesn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her. He called her na\u00efve when she expressed concern about getting bulky from lifting, which he felt was based on her coaches' manipulation. She got upset, and he's conflicted between feeling bad for lashing out and being frustrated with her \"cluelessness.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether calling her na\u00efve is wrong. Well, considering her traumatic background, her struggles might stem from that. The author might not be considering how her past affects her perception. He's being critical of her for not seeing things he deems obvious, but given her history, maybe she's doing her best to adapt. Being called na\u00efve could be hurtful, especially if she's already dealing with low self-esteem from her past. It might be unkind and not supportive for him to judge her that way without understanding the depth of her trauma. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's not showing empathy and is being dismissive of her efforts to heal.\n"
