She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if they're at fault for calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" in various situations.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a really tough background. Her parents were abusive, stole from her, and were anti-vaxxers. She went to a school with harmful teachings and had coaches who made her feel bad about her body. Now she's trying to be more open-minded, but there are areas where she's struggling to see through the upbringing she had. The author feels frustrated because she doesn't recognize that her parents were abusive and still believes some of the bad things her coaches told her about her body.\n\nThe key point here is whether calling her \"na\u00efve\" is appropriate. The author mentions that these things are obvious to him, but he's in a position of understanding her history. Her naivety stems from a very traumatic and manipulative upbringing. She's in a process of healing and unlearning harmful messages, which takes time. When he tells her she's na\u00efve, it's not just a minor misunderstanding\u2014it's a reflection of deep-seated trauma and manipulation she's working through.\n\nHe uses the example of her body image. Her coaches told her she'd get bulky easily, leading to an eating disorder. He corrects her, but the way he phrases it as her being na\u00efve could be dismissive of her struggles. Instead of validating her efforts to change and work through her past, he's pointing out her current limitations without considering the context of her upbringing.\n\nEven though his intentions might be to correct her, the term \"na\u00efve\" can come off as condescending. It's important to approach someone who's healing from trauma with patience and support. The girlfriend is actively trying to undo years of harmful teachings, which is challenging. His frustration is valid, but the way he's expressing it might be unhelpful and hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's not acknowledging the complexity of her situation and the effort she's making. He's using a term that's harsh given the circumstances, which could undermine her progress and make her feel invalidated.\n"
