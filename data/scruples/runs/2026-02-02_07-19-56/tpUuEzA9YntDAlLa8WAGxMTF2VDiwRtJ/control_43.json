She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old guy whose girlfriend is also 21. Her background is really tough: abusive parents who stole from her, were verbally abusive about her mental illness, anti-vax, and extremely conservative/religious. They sent her to a Christian school with racist, homophobic, and sexist teachings. Then she was a gymnast with coaches who told her she was fat and disgusting. Now in college, she's trying to become more liberal and educated, got vaccinated, and is proactive about her health.\n\nThe problem is the author calls her \"na\u00efve\" because she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her, and she still believes her coaches' negative comments about her body. He's frustrated that she doesn't see things he finds obvious, even though she's bright academically. He called her na\u00efve in the example about fitness, leading her to get upset. She's working on undoing the negative teachings, but he's frustrated with her progress.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether calling her na\u00efve is wrong. The author is frustrated, but the key points here are the context of her upbringing. She's had a lot of trauma and manipulation, which could affect her ability to see certain things. Her body image issues stem from coaches who lied to her. So, her \"na\u00efvety\" might not be due to stupidity but a result of being conditioned by abusers and manipulative figures.\n\nThe author is in a position where he's trying to help her see the truth, but his approach is to label her as na\u00efve. That could be hurtful, especially given her history. It might invalidate her struggles. She's making progress, but he's impatient. The question is whether his frustration and the way he expressed it (calling her na\u00efve) were wrong.\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often considers intent and impact. Even if the author's intent was to help, the impact of calling her na\u00efve could be damaging. It might make her feel like she's not trying hard enough or that her experiences aren't valid. Her trauma makes her more susceptible to these issues, so patience and understanding are needed. The author might be in the wrong because he's not accounting for her background and the time it takes to heal from such deep-seated issues.\n\nAlso, the example about the coaches' comments shows that she's still internalizing harmful messages. The author's response might be dismissive of her struggle to overcome that. Instead of patience and support, he's using frustration, which isn't helpful. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But some might argue that he's trying to help. However, the way he's approaching it is problematic.\n"
