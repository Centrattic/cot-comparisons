She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend \"na\u00efve.\" The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a tough background with abusive parents, anti-vax, conservative, religious, and she was in a Christian school with exposure to harmful propaganda. She also had issues in gymnastics where coaches body-shamed her, leading to an eating disorder. Now she's in college, trying to educate herself, and is proactive about her health.\n\nThe argument here is that the boyfriend calls her na\u00efve because she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her, and she still has body image issues based on her past. He gets frustrated when she can't see what he considers obvious. The question is whether he's wrong for that.\n\nHmm. So, considering her background, her naivety might stem from being manipulated and not having proper role models. She's trying to unlearn a lot of things, which takes time. The boyfriend's frustration is understandable, but is it wrong to call her na\u00efve? Well, using the term \"na\u00efve\" might be dismissive of her experiences and the trauma she's faced. It's possible he's not considering the psychological impact of her upbringing. He might be projecting his own understanding onto her without acknowledging her starting point. Also, the way he lashed out, even if he feels bad later, could invalidate her efforts to heal. So, maybe he is in the wrong because he's underestimating the effects of her trauma and the progress she's making. Using the word \"na\u00efve\" is judgmental and doesn't account for her circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong)."
