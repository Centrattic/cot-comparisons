She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve.\" The situation involves the girlfriend having a difficult upbringing with abusive parents and coaches who imposed harmful beliefs and behaviors on her. The author is frustrated that she doesn't recognize her parents' abuse or their manipulation by her coaches, and he called her na\u00efve, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's background is traumatic. She was subjected to abuse, misinformation, and body image issues from a young age. She's now actively trying to educate herself about the things she was denied. The author points out specific instances where she still clings to negative beliefs from her past, like thinking she'll get bulky easily, which her coaches told her to make her feel bad about eating.\n\nCalling someone na\u00efve in this context might be harsh. The girlfriend is working through trauma and trying to unlearn harmful teachings. The author might not realize that healing takes time and that her behavior isn't just willful ignorance but a result of deep-rooted conditioning. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it\u2014using a term like \"na\u00efve\"\u2014could be dismissive of her struggles. It's possible he didn't consider how his words might hurt her, especially given her history of being manipulated and abused. She might internalize the term \"na\u00efve\" as criticism of her intelligence or efforts to improve, which could trigger her past experiences of being belittled.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing concern and frustration because he sees things as obvious that she doesn't. He might be trying to help her see the truth. However, the method of addressing it by labeling her as na\u00efve might not be the most supportive approach. The key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate of her trauma and current healing process. The answer would likely be that he is in the wrong (A) because he didn't approach the situation with the empathy and patience needed for someone dealing with such a history.\n"
