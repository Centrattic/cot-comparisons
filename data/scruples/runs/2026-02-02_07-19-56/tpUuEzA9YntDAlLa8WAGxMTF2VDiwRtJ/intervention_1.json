She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. The girlfriend has a history of abuse and manipulation by her parents and coaches, leading to issues like body dysmorphia and anorexia. The boyfriend is frustrated because she doesn't see the abuse for what it was and still believes some of the negative things she was told.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's intention was to correct her misconceptions, but he used the word \"na\u00efve.\" That term can come off as dismissive or condescending. It's a judgment of her character rather than a constructive way to address her trauma. He might not realize that her lack of awareness is a result of her upbringing, not just naivety.\n\nHe mentions she's trying to unlearn harmful teachings, which requires time and support. By labeling her as na\u00efve, he's not acknowledging the effort she's making and might be invalidating her experiences. This could hurt her feelings and make her feel like she's failing, given her history of being criticized.\n\nAlso, the example he gave about her body image\u2014her coaches told her she'd get bulky, which led to her fear. He corrected her but called her na\u00efve. It's important to address misinformation without making her feel attacked. Maybe a better approach would be to explain the science behind muscle gain and reassure her, rather than criticizing her for believing harmful things.\n\nThe girlfriend's emotional response is valid; she's upset because he's not being supportive. The boyfriend might need to work on his communication style, being more empathetic and patient. His frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was harmful. He should focus on supporting her healing rather than judging her for past experiences she can't control.\n"
