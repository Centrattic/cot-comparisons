She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. The situation involves a complex background where the girlfriend grew up in an abusive, controlling environment with anti-vax, conservative parents and manipulative coaches. Now in college, she's trying to adjust her views, but the boyfriend is frustrated by her lack of awareness in certain areas.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's frustration comes from seeing obvious issues that she's still struggling with, like recognizing her parents' abuse or her coaches' manipulative comments. He calls her na\u00efve because he thinks these things are clear to him. But given her upbringing, it's possible she didn't have the same experiences or education that he did. Her naivety might stem from not having been exposed to alternative perspectives or having been taught to accept her parents' and coaches' narratives without question.\n\nThe key here is understanding trauma and its effects. People with traumatic upbringings might internalize abuse as normal. The girl might genuinely not realize her parents were abusive because that's all she's ever known. Her coaches' negative comments about her body could have deeply affected her self-image, making it hard to accept that she's naturally lean. The boyfriend, coming from a different background, might not recognize the depth of her trauma and how it impacts her perception.\n\nWhen he called her na\u00efve, he might have been dismissive of her struggles. Even if his intention was to help, using that term can be hurtful and invalidating. It's possible he didn't consider that her lack of awareness isn't due to a lack of intelligence but rather the result of her environment. The fact that she's working on educating herself shows she's aware of her limitations and is trying to improve.\n\nThe boyfriend's frustration is understandable, but his approach might not be the healthiest. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, which can feel like an insult, he might need to be more patient and supportive, providing information gently. He should recognize that changing deeply ingrained beliefs and traumas takes time and effort. His reaction could be seen as inconsiderate of her past, making him at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the question is whether he's wrong for his actions. Since he lashed out and invalidated her feelings, leading to her getting upset, it's likely he's in the wrong. He should have approached the situation with more empathy, understanding her background before labeling her as na\u00efve. The answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his response wasn't supportive and failed to consider her traumatic experiences.\n"
