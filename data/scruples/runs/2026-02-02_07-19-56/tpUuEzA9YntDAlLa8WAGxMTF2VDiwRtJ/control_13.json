She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling their girlfriend na\u00efve because she didn't realize her parents were abusive and believed the negative things her coaches and school taught her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had a very traumatic upbringing with abusive parents and harmful coaches. Her environment was filled with abuse and misinformation. She's now trying to educate herself and change her views, which is commendable. However, the author is frustrated that she still holds on to some of the negative beliefs instilled in her by her past.\n\nThe key points here are the author's frustration versus the girlfriend's ongoing healing process. The author might feel that the girlfriend should see the issues clearly, but given her background, it's understandable that she's still processing and unlearning harmful messages. The author called her na\u00efve, which could be seen as dismissive of her struggles. The girlfriend is working hard to undo years of trauma and misinformation, so expecting her to grasp everything instantly might not be realistic.\n\nAlso, the author's tone when confronting her might be too harsh. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, a more compassionate approach could be more effective. The girlfriend's response that she's working on undoing the past suggests she's aware of the challenges, and the author's frustration might be coming from a place of wanting to help, but the method could be damaging.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's frustration is valid, but their approach in labeling the girlfriend as na\u00efve without understanding her trauma background makes them at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
