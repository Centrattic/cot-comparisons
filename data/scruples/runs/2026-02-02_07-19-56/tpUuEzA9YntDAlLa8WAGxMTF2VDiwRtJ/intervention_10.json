She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend \"na\u00efve.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend had a really tough upbringing with abusive parents and coaches. Her parents were abusive, anti-vax, and conservative, leading her to be exposed to harmful ideologies. The coaches were also abusive, making her feel bad about her body. Now, she's trying to educate herself on these issues but still has a hard time seeing the truth.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he thinks she's too na\u00efve not to realize her parents were abusive and that her coaches were lying about her body. He called her na\u00efve, which upset her. She's working on undoing the damage from her past, and he's getting frustrated because it's taking time.\n\nSo, the key points are her history of trauma, the author's frustration, and the conflict over communication. The author's use of the word \"na\u00efve\" might come off as dismissive of her struggles. Instead of being patient and supportive, he's pointing out her lack of awareness, which she's already aware is a challenge.\n\nBut wait, is the author wrong to express frustration? People can feel frustrated in relationships, but how they express it matters. Saying she's na\u00efve might not be the best approach. It's important to consider how his words affect her, especially given her trauma. She might feel criticized for things beyond her control.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might think he's helping her see the truth. But using \"na\u00efve\" could be triggering or invalidating. The best approach might be to support her efforts to unlearn, not criticize her for the progress she hasn't made yet.\n\nSo, considering her background and the way he communicated his frustration, the author is likely in the wrong. He should have used a more supportive approach instead of labeling her as na\u00efve.\n"
