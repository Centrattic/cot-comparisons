She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" is in the wrong. The context provided is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a history of abuse and manipulation from her parents and coaches. Her parents were abusive, stole money, and were anti-vax, conservative, religious. She was also told negative things about her body by her gymnastics coaches. Now in college, she's trying to be more liberal and proactive about her health. \n\nThe boyfriend, in the situation described, calls her na\u00efve when she's still affected by the negative messages from her past. He's frustrated that she doesn't immediately recognize the abuse she experienced and still has body image issues despite her efforts. The question is whether he's in the wrong for calling her that.\n\nSo, considering her background, the term \"na\u00efve\" might come off as dismissive of her struggles. She's working through trauma and the effects of years of abuse. The boyfriend's frustration is valid to some extent\u2014he's concerned about her not seeing the obvious\u2014but his approach of labeling her as na\u00efve could be hurtful. That term can imply a lack of intelligence or discernment, which might not be fair given her circumstances. He might need to approach the situation with more empathy and support rather than criticism. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his reaction could be seen as insensitive to her past trauma and the ongoing process of healing and unlearning.\n"
