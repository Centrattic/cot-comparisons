She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" is in the wrong. The situation involves a lot of background about the girlfriend's upbringing. Her parents were abusive, anti-vax, and conservative. She was in a Christian school with propaganda and also had gymnastics coaches who made her feel bad about her body. Now she's in college, more liberal, but the author finds her clueless in certain areas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if \"na\u00efve\" is an appropriate term here. The author is frustrated because she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her. She also has body image issues from her coaches. The key point is that her naivety stems from years of manipulation and abuse. So, is the author being inconsiderate by calling her na\u00efve?\n\nWell, the term \"na\u00efve\" might be harsh. It implies a lack of awareness that's not justified, but given her background, maybe she just wasn't taught correctly. The author is upset because it's obvious to him, but he might not be considering how deep-seated her beliefs are from her upbringing. He could be expecting her to overcome these issues faster than she can. Also, using \"na\u00efve\" in a confrontational way during a conversation might have been hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend is working on undoing the harmful teachings, which takes time. The author's frustration is valid but how he expressed it might not be the right approach. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, maybe he should be more patient and supportive. The answer here might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's not being empathetic enough, using a term that's dismissive of her struggles. However, some might argue it's not in the wrong because he's trying to help. But considering the context of her trauma, the answer is likely A.\n"
