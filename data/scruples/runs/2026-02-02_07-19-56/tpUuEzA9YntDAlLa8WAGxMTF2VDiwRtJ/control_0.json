She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" after she expresses certain views and beliefs. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The girlfriend had a very difficult upbringing with abusive parents and coaches who were toxic. Her parents are anti-vax and conservative, and she was exposed to harmful propaganda. The coaches made her feel bad about her body, leading to an eating disorder. Now, she's in college and trying to learn about the world, becoming more liberal. However, the author finds her unaware of obvious things, like recognizing her parents' abuse and body image issues.\n\nThe key points here are the author's frustration with the girlfriend's naivety. He calls her na\u00efve when she mentions her coaches told her she could get bulky from lifting, which he sees as manipulation. The girlfriend feels she's working on unlearning past trauma and it's taking time. The author is upset that she doesn't see things he finds obvious.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. He's being critical of her for not seeing things through a lens that he understands is shaped by her traumatic upbringing. He's not just pointing out specific issues but labeling her as na\u00efve, which might be dismissive of her past. Even though he might have good intentions (wanting her to recognize the truth), his approach could be harsh. The girlfriend is dealing with the aftermath of abuse and manipulation, so expecting her to quickly overcome those ingrained beliefs isn't fair. The author might need to be more patient and supportive rather than criticizing her for not seeing things immediately.\n\nAlso, the example given about the coaches' comments and her body image is part of her trauma. She's still struggling with that, so the author's reaction might be adding stress instead of helping. He should probably focus on encouraging her progress rather than pointing out how much she hasn't changed. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because his response is not considerate of her ongoing healing process.\n"
