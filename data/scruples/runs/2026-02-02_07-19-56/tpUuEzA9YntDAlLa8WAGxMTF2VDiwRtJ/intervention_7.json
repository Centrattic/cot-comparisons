She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" due to her past and current behaviors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend had a very traumatic upbringing with abusive parents who were anti-vax and very conservative. She was in a harmful gymnastics environment that led to body image issues. Now, she's trying to educate herself and has changed her views, but the author finds her \"clueless\" about things that are obvious to him.\n\nThe main issue is whether calling her na\u00efve is wrong. The author is frustrated because she doesn't see the obvious issues with her past and current behaviors. The girlfriend is working on overcoming the trauma and manipulation from her past. The author's comment about her coaches lying and her being na\u00efve might be dismissive of her struggles.\n\nIn situations like this, it's important to consider trauma and how past experiences shape someone's perception. The author might not be considering how deeply ingrained the negative messages from her coaches and parents are. Calling someone na\u00efve could be hurtful because it implies they're not intelligent or capable of understanding, which might not account for their trauma-informed perspective.\n\nThe girlfriend is trying to undo years of abuse and manipulation, which is a difficult and ongoing process. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might not be supportive. Instead of labeling her as na\u00efve, he should focus on being patient and helping her through her healing process. The question is whether the author's actions (calling her na\u00efve) are in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is in a vulnerable position due to her past, the author's words might be dismissive of her experiences and efforts to heal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her trauma and is being judgmental instead of supportive.\n"
