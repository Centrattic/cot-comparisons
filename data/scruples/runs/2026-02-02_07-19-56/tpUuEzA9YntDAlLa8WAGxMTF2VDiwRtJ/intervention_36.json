She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend na\u00efve. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a really tough upbringing. Her parents were abusive, stole money, and were anti-vaxxers with conservative, religious views. She was in a school that spread harmful propaganda. Plus, her gymnastics coaches made her feel bad about her body. Now she's in college, trying to educate herself on progressive issues, but she's still struggling with the effects of her past\u2014like not realizing her parents were abusive and dealing with body dysmorphia.\n\nThe author got frustrated when she didn't see through the lies her coaches told her about her body. He called her na\u00efve, which upset her. He acknowledges she's smart and emotional but clueless in other areas. He feels bad for lashing out but is still frustrated.\n\nSo, the question is: Is he in the wrong? \n\nI need to consider if calling someone na\u00efve is appropriate here. The girlfriend is working on overcoming trauma and internalized messages from her past. Her not recognizing the abuse yet might be due to learned helplessness or gaslighting. The author's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it might be the issue. Telling someone they're na\u00efve can sound dismissive, especially when they're already dealing with low self-esteem and trauma. \n\nHe might not fully grasp the psychological impact of her upbringing. Even if the things he points out seem obvious to him, they might not be to someone who's been manipulated for years. His comment about her coaches lying to her could come off as blaming her for not seeing through the manipulation, which isn't fair. She's in recovery mode, and such feedback might hinder her progress.\n\nOn the other hand, he's concerned and wants to help. But the approach matters. Instead of labeling her na\u00efve, maybe a more supportive way to address her misconceptions would be better. The key is whether his words were hurtful and if they undermined her efforts to heal. \n\nGiven that she's in a process of unlearning and healing, his frustration leading to a harsh comment might be unkind. So, he's not entirely wrong for being frustrated, but his approach was probably not helpful. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for how he expressed his feelings.\n"
