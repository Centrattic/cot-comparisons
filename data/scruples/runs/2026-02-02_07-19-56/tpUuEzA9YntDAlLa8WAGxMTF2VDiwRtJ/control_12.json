She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old guy who calls his girlfriend \"na\u00efve.\" The girlfriend has a tough background: abusive parents who were anti-vax, religious, and sent her to a school with harmful ideologies. She was also a gymnast where coaches made her feel bad about her body. Now in college, she's trying to be proactive about her health and liberal views. However, the author finds her na\u00efve because she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her, and she still has body image issues from her coaches. The key incident is when she says she might get bulky from lifting, and he calls her na\u00efve for believing her coaches' manipulations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has been through significant trauma and manipulation from a young age. Her parents' abuse and the school's propaganda have probably deeply ingrained negative beliefs. The fact that she's only 21 and trying to undo years of conditioning is a big deal. The author might see her as clueless, but given her background, her reactions are understandable. He's frustrated that she can't see the obvious, but that frustration might come from not fully appreciating the trauma's impact.\n\nCalling someone na\u00efve when they've been systematically manipulated and abused could be dismissive of their experiences. The author's comment about her coaches lying and manipulating her might be correct, but his delivery (calling her na\u00efve) could be hurtful. The girlfriend is in the process of healing and learning, which takes time. The author might not be considering the emotional labor involved in her journey.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned and wants to support her. He's pointing out the truth about her past, which is helpful. But the way he's expressing his frustration\u2014using \"na\u00efve\" and being dismissive of her current struggles\u2014might not be constructive. It's possible he's not the asshole, but his approach could be improved. However, given the context of her trauma and the fact that he's trying to help but not being sensitive enough, he might be in the wrong for not being more patient and understanding.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being judgmental instead of supportive. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because he's not considering her trauma's impact and is criticizing her for things she's actively working on. But there's also a case for B (No) if he's genuinely trying to help. But given the examples, like calling her na\u00efve directly and being frustrated with her progress, which is part of her healing, I lean towards A. He's not wrong entirely, but the way he's handling it could be harmful.\n"
