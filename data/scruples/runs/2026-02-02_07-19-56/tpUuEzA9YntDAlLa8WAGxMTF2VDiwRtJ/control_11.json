She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" in the given situation. The scenario involves a lot of background about the girlfriend's difficult upbringing, including abuse, anti-vax parents, and harmful messages from her gymnastics coaches. The author is frustrated because he feels his girlfriend isn't seeing the obvious issues with her parents' behavior and other things like body image.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has been through a lot of trauma and has had her worldview shaped by toxic influences. The author points out that she's trying to educate herself and is making positive changes, like getting vaccinated and managing her reproductive health. However, the author is upset that she's not seeing things he considers obvious, like the abuse from her parents or the manipulation by her coaches.\n\nThe key here is whether calling her \"na\u00efve\" is the problem. On one hand, the author is expressing frustration because he sees these issues clearly, and he might feel that his girlfriend isn't learning from her past. On the other hand, given her history of abuse and manipulation, it's possible that her ability to perceive and process these issues is still developing. She's mentioned trying to undo the teachings from her past, which takes time and support.\n\nUsing the term \"na\u00efve\" can be seen as dismissive. It might invalidate her efforts and her past experiences. Instead of helping her see the issues, calling her na\u00efve could make her feel defensive or like she's failing. The author might not be recognizing the impact of her upbringing on her current perspective. Even if his intentions are to help, the way he's communicating his frustration could be unhelpful.\n\nAlso, the example given about her worrying about getting bulky when lifting weights\u2014her coaches told her that, and the author points out they were lying. But she's still clinging to those messages from her past. It's understandable that she's struggling to rewire those thoughts. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might not be the most supportive. He might need to be more patient and work with her to build her confidence in recognizing the truth, rather than labeling her as na\u00efve, which could hurt her self-esteem.\n\nIn relationships, especially where there's a power dynamic or one person is trying to support another through trauma, communication is key. Being critical might push her away instead of helping her. The author could be in the wrong if he's not taking into account her history and the progress she's making, even if he's concerned about her not seeing things as clearly as he does. The term \"na\u00efve\" might be hurtful and not constructive in this context. So, considering all that, the answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
