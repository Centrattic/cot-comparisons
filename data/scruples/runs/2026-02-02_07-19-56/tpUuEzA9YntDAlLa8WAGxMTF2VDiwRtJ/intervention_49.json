She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve.\" The situation involves the girlfriend having a history of abuse and trauma from her family and coaches, which led to her current struggles with recognizing abuse and body image.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was raised in an abusive environment by anti-vaxxers and was subjected to harmful propaganda. Her coaches also contributed to her low self-esteem. She's now in college, trying to educate herself and take control of her health. However, she still has difficulty seeing the abuse she experienced and holds onto negative beliefs about her body.\n\nThe author called her \"na\u00efve\" when she expressed concerns about building muscle, referencing her past coaches' manipulative comments. The author is frustrated because they feel these things are obvious, but the girlfriend is still influenced by her traumatic experiences.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the use of the term \"na\u00efve\" and the context of her trauma. Using judgmental language like \"na\u00efve\" can be dismissive of someone's experiences, especially when they've been through significant abuse. The author is frustrated, but it's important to recognize that the girlfriend is still in the process of healing and unlearning harmful messages. The author might not be considering how their words can invalidate her struggles and make her feel worse.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014getting upset\u2014suggests that the term hurt her. Even if the author's intention was to correct her, the delivery was harsh. It's possible that the author should approach the situation with more empathy and support, helping her see things differently without making her feel criticized. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it might be unkind and not conducive to her healing.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their use of \"na\u00efve\" was dismissive and potentially hurtful, not accounting for her traumatic background. They should focus on supportive communication rather than frustration-driven criticism.\n"
