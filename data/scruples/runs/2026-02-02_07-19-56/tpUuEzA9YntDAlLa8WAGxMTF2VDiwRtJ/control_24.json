She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who called their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" is in the wrong. The context is that the girlfriend grew up in a very difficult environment with abusive parents and coaches who manipulated her. She's now in college, trying to adjust her views, but the boyfriend feels she's not seeing things clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has a history of being manipulated and abused, which probably affected her self-esteem and perception. Her background includes being told she's fat and ugly, leading to body dysmorphia and eating disorders. Now, when her boyfriend calls her na\u00efve, he's pointing out that she still believes the negative things she was told by her coaches, like she builds muscle quickly and might get chunky. But from her perspective, these are ingrained beliefs from years of abuse.\n\nThe boyfriend's frustration is understandable. He sees things that are obvious to him as not being obvious to her, which can be frustrating. However, he's in a position where he's trying to challenge her deeply rooted beliefs. The key here is whether his approach was appropriate. Calling someone na\u00efve can come off as dismissive, especially if they've been through trauma. It might undermine her efforts to heal and learn new perspectives.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is actively trying to educate herself and unlearn the harmful things she was taught. This is a process that takes time and patience. The boyfriend's frustration might be valid, but the way he expressed it\u2014using the term \"na\u00efve\"\u2014could be hurtful and not supportive. Instead of labeling her as na\u00efve, he might benefit from a more empathetic approach that encourages her without making her feel criticized.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the boyfriend wants to support her in recognizing the manipulative tactics she faced, he needs to approach the conversation with understanding and patience. The term \"na\u00efve\" might not convey that support and could instead make her feel defensive or invalidated, especially given her history.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the boyfriend's intention might be to help, but his method might be harmful. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and for using a term that could be seen as dismissive of her struggles.\n"
