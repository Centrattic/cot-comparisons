She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend, who has a traumatic background with abusive parents, anti-vaxx and conservative views, and was subjected to harmful coaching in gymnastics leading to body image issues. The author is frustrated with her naivety and called her that, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has a lot of trauma and has had to unlearn a lot of harmful beliefs. The author feels frustrated because they think she's missing obvious truths, like recognizing her parents' abuse or her body image issues. However, the girlfriend is in the process of healing and learning, which takes time and can be difficult.\n\nThe author's comment about her being \"na\u00efve\" might come off as dismissive of her struggles. Even if the author thinks they're helping, using that term could invalidate her experiences and efforts. It's important to acknowledge that trauma can affect how someone perceives reality. The girlfriend might genuinely not see things the author does because of her upbringing.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration is understandable, but expressing it by labeling her as na\u00efve might not be constructive. It could hurt her feelings and make her feel like she's not being supported. Instead of pointing out her naivety, maybe the author should approach her with patience and provide support in a way that encourages her growth without making her feel criticized.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is in a position of trying to help her see things differently, but the method might be harmful. Calling someone na\u00efve can feel like minimizing their trauma. The girlfriend is working hard to unlearn harmful teachings, so the author's frustration might stem from not seeing the progress as quickly as they'd like. However, healing isn't linear, and the author needs to respect that process.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might need to have a more compassionate and understanding approach, recognizing that what's obvious to them isn't necessarily obvious to someone with such a different background. The term \"na\u00efve\" could be hurtful and not the best way to express concern. Instead, the author should focus on supporting her efforts and offering guidance without judgment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words could affect their girlfriend's self-esteem and healing process. They need to approach the situation with more empathy and understanding, rather than frustration and a label like na\u00efve.\n"
