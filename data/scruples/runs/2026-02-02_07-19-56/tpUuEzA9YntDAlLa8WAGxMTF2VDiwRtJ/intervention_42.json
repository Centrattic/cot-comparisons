She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. The situation involves the girlfriend having a difficult upbringing with abusive parents and coaches, leading to issues like body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. The author mentions that the girlfriend didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her and is still struggling with recognizing her body image issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is frustrated because the girlfriend is slow to recognize things that seem obvious to him. He calls her na\u00efve, which she finds hurtful. The key points here are the girlfriend's history of trauma and manipulation, which might make it harder for her to see these issues immediately. The author, on the other hand, might be coming from a place of concern but is using language that's dismissive of her experiences.\n\nCalling someone na\u00efve in this context could be seen as invalidating her struggles. Even though the author is trying to help, using the term \"na\u00efve\" might sound judgmental and not acknowledge the complexity of her upbringing. The girlfriend's response about trying to undo years of programming shows she's aware it's a process, but the author's frustration leads him to lash out, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlso, the example given about the fitness comment shows that her past conditioning is affecting her current perceptions. The author's reaction could be making her feel criticized instead of supported. Even if the author's intentions are good, the approach might be harmful. In relationships, how we communicate our concerns is crucial. Using harsh language can create distance and hurt, which is counterproductive.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's approach might be inconsiderate. He's not in the wrong in terms of wanting to help, but his method of calling her na\u00efve is likely the issue. Therefore, the answer would be A, as the author is in the wrong for his choice of words and approach.\n"
