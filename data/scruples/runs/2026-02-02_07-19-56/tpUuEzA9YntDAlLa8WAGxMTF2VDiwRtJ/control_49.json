She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" for not realizing the abusive nature of her parents and coaches.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend had a tough upbringing with abusive parents and coaches who were harmful. She's now in college, trying to educate herself on liberal issues, but the author finds her na\u00efve because she doesn't see the obvious problems in her past. The key incident was when the author criticized her for not recognizing that her coaches were lying to her about building muscle, which led to anorexia.\n\nSo, the author is frustrated because the girlfriend isn't seeing things as clearly as he does. He calls her na\u00efve, which upsets her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has a history of being manipulated and abused. She's in the process of recovering and unlearning harmful messages. The author, while maybe well-intentioned, is criticizing her for not having the same level of awareness he does. It's possible that he's underestimating the trauma she's experienced and the difficulty in overcoming it. Calling someone na\u00efve in this context might be dismissive of her struggle and the time it takes to heal.\n\nBut also, the author might feel frustrated because he sees the obvious issues and wants her to recognize them. However, the way he's expressing his frustration\u2014using the term \"na\u00efve\"\u2014could be hurtful. The girlfriend is trying to work through this, and the author's approach might not be supportive. It's important to validate her efforts and progress rather than pointing out her shortcomings.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the key is whether the author's actions were unkind or dismissive. The answer might lean towards A (author is the asshole) because he's not being supportive enough, given her background. But maybe there's nuance. The author is concerned and wants her to see the truth, but his method of expressing that concern is harmful. The right approach might be to offer support and patience rather than criticism. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
