She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend na\u00efve. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a really tough upbringing: abusive parents, anti-vaxxers, conservative, religious, sent her to a school with harmful propaganda. Plus, her gymnastics coaches made her feel bad about her body. Now she's trying to educate herself and is being proactive about her health, but the author thinks she's na\u00efve because she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her, and she still struggles with body image issues.\n\nThe author's main frustration is that these things are obvious to him, but she doesn't see them. He called her na\u00efve, and she got upset. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the background of the girlfriend and the context of the argument. The girlfriend's upbringing has left her with deep-seated issues. The author is trying to help her see the truth, but his approach might be dismissive. \n\nCalling someone na\u00efve can come off as condescending, especially if they've been through trauma. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way he's expressing his frustration might not be supportive. He's trying to correct her, but maybe he's not accounting for how long it takes to undo years of abuse and misinformation.\n\nAlso, body dysmorphia is a serious issue. Her coaches made her feel like she was building muscle too quickly, which affected her self-image. The author pointing out that they were lying is valid, but the way he did it might not be the most constructive. She's in a process of healing, and being told she's na\u00efve could make her feel worse.\n\nThe author might be in a good place wanting to help, but his method could be hurtful. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend has significant trauma, expecting her to quickly overcome those ingrained beliefs and perceptions isn't fair. The author's frustration is understandable but the approach is problematic. \n\nSo the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering her background and trauma, and his response is condescending rather than supportive.\n"
