She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" for not realizing that her parents were abusive and for having body image issues from her coaches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had a very traumatic upbringing with abusive parents and coaches. Her parents were controlling, stole money, and were anti-vax and conservative. The coaches made her feel bad about her body. Now, she's trying to educate herself and has made progress in some areas, like getting vaccinated and managing her health. However, she still struggles with body dysmorphia and not seeing her natural leanness.\n\nThe author called her na\u00efve when she expressed concerns about getting bulky from lifting weights. He pointed out that her coaches were lying to her. She got upset, and the author feels frustrated because he thinks these things are obvious. But given her history, maybe her reactions are understandable. Trauma can affect how someone perceives themselves and the world. Being called na\u00efve might come off as dismissive of her past experiences and ongoing struggles.\n\nThe author might not realize that his girlfriend's responses are rooted in deep-seated trauma. Even though he's trying to help, his approach could be triggering or invalidating. He says he feels bad for lashing out, which shows some self-awareness, but the core issue is whether he's in the wrong for his reaction.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's frustration is valid, but his method of expressing it might not be. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, maybe a more supportive approach would be better. The girlfriend is working on undoing years of negative programming, so patience and empathy might be needed here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's dismissing her experiences and trauma, which is not helpful and could be harmful.\n"
