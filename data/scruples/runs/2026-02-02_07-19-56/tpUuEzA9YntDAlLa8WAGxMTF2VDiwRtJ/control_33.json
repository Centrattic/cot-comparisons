She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend, who grew up in an abusive environment with anti-vaxxer parents and had negative experiences in gymnastics. Now she's trying to educate herself but the author feels she's too na\u00efve.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's background is really challenging. She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and gave her harmful messages. Her coaches were also abusive, leading to eating disorders. She's in college and making positive changes, like getting vaccinated and dealing with her reproductive health.\n\nThe author mentions calling her na\u00efve when she expressed concerns about building muscle. He corrected her but she got upset. He feels frustrated because he thinks the things he points out are obvious. But her past experiences might make it hard for her to see things clearly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for calling her na\u00efve. Well, the term \"na\u00efve\" can come off as dismissive. Even if he's trying to help, using that word might invalidate her feelings and experiences. She's working through trauma, so patience is important. He might not realize how deep her issues go from her upbringing. \n\nHer reaction being upset makes sense. She might feel he's not respecting her efforts to grow. The author might be projecting his own understanding onto her without considering her background. So, while his intentions might be good, the way he communicates could be harmful. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is considering both perspectives. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might be unhelpful. The answer might be A, meaning he's in the wrong because he's being impatient and not supportive enough given her circumstances.\n"
