She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend naive. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a really tough upbringing. Her parents were abusive, stole money, and were anti-vaxxers. She was in a religious school that taught her harmful stuff, and her gymnastics coaches made her feel bad about her body, leading to an eating disorder. Now, she's in college, trying to correct her beliefs and is proactive about health issues, which is a big step.\n\nThe author is frustrated because the girlfriend seems naive in certain situations. For example, when she worries about getting bulky from lifting weights, and the author points out her coaches were probably lying. He calls her naive, which hurts her feelings. She's working on unlearning the bad stuff from her past, which is a long process.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's history of trauma and manipulation, the author's frustration, and the way he expressed it. Calling someone naive can be dismissive, especially if they've had their worldview distorted by others. The author might not realize that the girlfriend is still in the process of healing and learning. Even though he has good intentions, his approach might be too harsh. The question is whether his frustration justifies the way he communicated, or if he should be more patient and supportive. Considering her background, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more understanding. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
