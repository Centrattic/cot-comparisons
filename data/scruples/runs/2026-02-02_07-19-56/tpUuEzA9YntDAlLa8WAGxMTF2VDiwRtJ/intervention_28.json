She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" in various situations.\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend had a really tough upbringing with abusive parents and coaches. Her parents are anti-vax, conservative, and religious, and she was in a school that taught her harmful stuff. The coaches made her feel bad about her body, leading to eating issues. Now she's in college, trying to educate herself but is still struggling to see through the trauma she experienced.\n\nThe boyfriend is frustrated because she doesn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her, and she still believes some harmful things her coaches said. He called her \"na\u00efve\" when she expressed concern about getting bulky from lifting, which he thinks her coaches manipulated her into believing. She got upset, and he's conflicted between feeling bad for lashing out and being frustrated by her lack of awareness.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, calling someone na\u00efve can be dismissive, especially if they're dealing with deep-seated trauma. The girlfriend is working on unlearning harmful messages, which takes time. The boyfriend's frustration is understandable, but his approach might not be supportive. Instead of labeling her as na\u00efve, he could be more patient and offer education or resources. His comment about the coaches was factual, but delivered in a way that might feel blaming. He needs to consider her emotional state and the trauma she's overcoming. The key here is that his criticism might not be helpful, even if his intention was to correct her. The answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's not supporting her healing process with empathy, and his words were hurtful despite his good intentions.\n"
