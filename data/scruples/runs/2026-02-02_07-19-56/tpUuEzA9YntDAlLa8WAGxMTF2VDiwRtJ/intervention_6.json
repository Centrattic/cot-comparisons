She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" is in the wrong. The context provided shows that the girlfriend had a very difficult upbringing with abusive parents and coaches. She's now trying to unlearn the negative things she was taught, which is a tough process. The author is frustrated because she doesn't see the obvious issues, like her parents' abuse or her body image.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamic here. The girlfriend has been through a lot of trauma and manipulation. Her parents stole money, were verbally abusive, and her coaches contributed to her eating disorder. She's now in college, trying to educate herself and take control of her health, which is commendable. However, she's still influenced by the negative messages from her past.\n\nThe author points out that she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her. That's a red flag. Abuse is often not immediately recognized by victims, especially if they were conditioned to believe it's normal. The author's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it might be the issue. Calling her \"na\u00efve\" in the example about the gym comment could be dismissive of her past experiences. He's essentially saying her coaches were lying, but maybe she internalized those messages so deeply that it's hard for her to see their manipulation now.\n\nHe says she's \"clueless\" about obvious things, but given her background, it's not surprising she's struggling. People with trauma often have distorted perceptions, especially when it comes to self-image. Her body dysmorphia and anorexia history tie into this. The author might not realize how ingrained those negative beliefs are in her psyche.\n\nHe might be projecting his own understanding onto her. Just because he sees the issues clearly doesn't mean she'll overcome them quickly. Healing takes time, and she's actively working on it. The author's frustration is valid, but his reaction could be harmful. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, he might need to approach it with more empathy and patience, maybe helping her through her healing process rather than criticizing her progress.\n\nAlso, the way he lashed out might have triggered her or made her feel invalidated. She's in a vulnerable position, trying to undo years of manipulation. The author's choice of words, especially labeling her as na\u00efve, might come off as condescending. It's important to recognize that her naivety isn't due to a lack of intelligence but because of her upbringing.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to help her see the truth, his method could be hurtful. He needs to approach her struggles with compassion, understanding that unlearning deep-seated beliefs is a slow and difficult process. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because of the lack of empathy and the dismissive nature of his reaction.\n"
