She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend calls his girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" because he thinks she doesn't recognize the abusive behavior of her parents and coaches. He also gets frustrated when she doesn't see things as clearly as he does, like the coaches lying to her about her body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had a really tough upbringing with abusive parents and controlling coaches. They were anti-vax, religious, and spread harmful ideologies. Her gymnastics coaches made her anorexic, which is serious. She's now in college, trying to educate herself and make healthier choices, like getting vaccinated and taking charge of her reproductive health. So she's making progress, but there's a lot of trauma and conditioning from her past.\n\nThe boyfriend is frustrated because he sees her as na\u00efve. He called her out for not realizing her parents were abusive until he told her, and for believing the lies her coaches told her. His comment about her being na\u00efve led to an argument. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI should think about how to respond. He's trying to help her see the truth, but maybe his approach is harsh. She's working through trauma, which takes time. Calling her na\u00efve might invalidate her experiences and make her feel worse. She's not being ignorant on purpose; it's a result of her environment. He might need more patience and empathy. Even though his intentions are good, the way he's expressing his frustration could be hurtful. So, is he in the wrong? It's a judgment call between his concern versus her need for support. The answer might be A, yes, because his approach is dismissive of her trauma, but maybe B if his intentions are good. Hmm. I think the key point is that he's being impatient and not considering her background enough. So AITA is about accountability. He's not wrong in wanting to help, but the way he's doing it is wrong. So answer A.\n"
