She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve.\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend had a really tough upbringing. Her parents were abusive, anti-vaxxers, conservative, and religious. She was sent to a school with harmful propaganda. Plus, her gymnastics coaches were abusive about her body image, leading to an eating disorder. Now, she's trying to undo all that, becoming more liberal and proactive about her health.\n\nThe author is frustrated that she's \"na\u00efve\" because she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her. He's upset when she clings to things her abusers said, like the coaches lying about her muscle gain. He called her na\u00efve, which upset her.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author sees things clearly, but the girlfriend is still healing. Her not recognizing the abuse might be because of trauma or gaslighting she experienced. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might be harsh. He's not just pointing out her past; he's labeling her as na\u00efve, which can be dismissive of her struggles. Even if she's making progress, calling her na\u00efve could be undermining her efforts. She's in a difficult process of unlearning harmful messages, and the author's tone might not be supportive. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response is that she's trying to change but it's hard. The author might need to be more patient and understanding. While he wants to help, his method of calling her na\u00efve might be counterproductive. It's possible he's not in the wrong entirely, but he's not handling it well. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given the context of her trauma, the answer might lean towards \"Yes\" because his frustration is expressed in a way that doesn't consider her healing process. He should be more supportive rather than critical, even if he's trying to help.\n"
