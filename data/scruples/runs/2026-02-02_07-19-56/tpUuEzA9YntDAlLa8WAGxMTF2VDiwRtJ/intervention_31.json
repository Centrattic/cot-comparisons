She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called their girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend having a really bad upbringing with abusive parents and manipulative coaches. The author feels frustrated because she's not seeing things as he does, like recognizing the abuse or her body image issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had abusive parents who were stealing from her and using her mental health issues against her. Plus, her coaches were making her feel bad about her body. She's trying to unlearn all that, which is a tough process. The author's frustration might come from not understanding how long trauma recovery takes.\n\nHe called her na\u00efve after she expressed concerns about building muscle, citing her past coaches' negative comments. The author accused her of being manipulated, which is true, but the way he did it might have been hurtful. The girlfriend is clearly working on healing, so being told she's na\u00efve could make her feel defensive or like she's failing to improve.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's approach was constructive. He might be right about her needing to see the truth, but using the term \"na\u00efve\" and expressing frustration in that way might not be supportive. He should probably approach her struggles with more empathy, recognizing that overcoming years of abuse and indoctrination isn't easy. So, the answer might be that he's in the wrong because his response wasn't considerate of her healing process.\n"
