She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're at fault for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. The girlfriend has a lot of trauma from her past\u2014abusive parents, anti-vax, conservative religious upbringing, and manipulative gymnastics coaches. She's trying to educate herself now, but the author feels frustrated when she doesn't see things as obvious as he does, like her coaches lying to her about her body or her parents' abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her background. Growing up in such an environment, especially with abuse and manipulation, can really affect someone's self-perception and ability to recognize when they're being mistreated. Even as an adult, the trauma might make it hard for her to see things clearly. She's mentioned working on undoing those teachings, which takes time. So, the author's frustration is understandable, but how does that translate to the way he expressed it?\n\nCalling someone na\u00efve can come off as dismissive. The author is pointing out things that are clear to him, but from her perspective, those might be deeply ingrained beliefs. The term \"na\u00efve\" might imply she's just not trying hard enough, which isn't fair. She's actively trying to learn and heal, but it's a process. The author might not realize that his criticism could trigger her past experiences, making her feel criticized or like she's failing.\n\nAlso, in the example with the gym, her coaches' comments are part of her traumatic experience. When he says they were lying, it's a valid point, but the way he delivered it\u2014labeling her as na\u00efve\u2014might not help her healing. It's important to approach such situations with empathy, recognizing her efforts rather than focusing on what she hasn't overcome yet.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of his intentions (he's concerned and wants her to see the truth), but the method of communication is problematic. Using harsh language like \"na\u00efve\" without understanding her trauma could be harmful. The key is supporting her growth without judgment. So, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong for not considering her trauma-informed approach and for using dismissive language.\n"
