She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the boyfriend) is at fault for calling his girlfriend \"na\u00efve.\" \n\nFirst, context is key here. The girlfriend has a history of being raised in an abusive, anti-vax, conservative environment, plus she was a gymnast with coaches who made her feel bad about her body. She's now trying to educate herself on these issues. The boyfriend is frustrated because she doesn't see the obvious problems with her past, like her parents' abuse or her coaches' manipulation.\n\nHe called her na\u00efve because she still believes some of the negative things her coaches told her about her body and health. The question is whether that criticism is justified or if he's being too harsh. \n\nConsidering her background, she's working against a lot of ingrained beliefs. Even if something seems obvious to him, it's possible she's still processing trauma and learning new perspectives. The way he phrased his criticism (\"how can you be so na\u00efve\") sounds dismissive and maybe lacks empathy. He might be projecting his own understanding onto her, not considering the time and effort required to unlearn harmful messages. \n\nAlso, when someone is dealing with body dysmorphia and past trauma, their perception of reality can be skewed. His frustration is understandable, but calling her na\u00efve could hurt her feelings and undermine her progress. He might need to approach the situation with more patience and support instead of frustration. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely that he is at fault because he's not being supportive and is dismissing her struggles, even though he's well-intentioned. The key point is that he's not considering the depth of her challenges and the time needed to overcome them.\n"
