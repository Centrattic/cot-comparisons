She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. The situation involves a lot of context about the girlfriend's background. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a really tough upbringing with abusive parents, anti-vax, conservative, religious, and she was sent to a school with harmful propaganda. Also, her gymnastics coaches made her feel bad about her body. Now, she's trying to become more liberal and educated, but the boyfriend is frustrated because she seems clueless or na\u00efve about things that are obvious to him. The example given is about her body image and lifting weights.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling her na\u00efve. The user thinks yes, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend might feel frustrated because he sees things that are harmful and she still believes the negative messages from her past. He's trying to help her see the truth, but his approach could be harsh. Being called na\u00efve might feel like an attack, especially when she's already dealing with trauma and trying to heal. That could be hurtful and counterproductive.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is concerned because he genuinely wants her to understand the reality of her situation. He might not be aware of how his words come off. He mentions that he feels bad for lashing out, indicating he recognizes that his approach might be too harsh. The girlfriend is working on undoing years of programming, which is a difficult process. The boyfriend's frustration is understandable, but the way he expresses it might not be supportive.\n\nConsidering the context, the key points are the girlfriend's traumatic background and the boyfriend's approach to helping her. Calling her na\u00efve might invalidate her struggles and her efforts to overcome past trauma. Instead of being condescending, a more empathetic approach could be more effective. The boyfriend needs to approach her with patience and understanding, acknowledging her progress and the challenges she's facing. \n\nTherefore, the author's frustration is valid, but the way he expressed it (calling her na\u00efve) is not constructive. He should be in the wrong because his words could be hurtful and unkind, even if his intentions are good. So, the answer is A.\n"
