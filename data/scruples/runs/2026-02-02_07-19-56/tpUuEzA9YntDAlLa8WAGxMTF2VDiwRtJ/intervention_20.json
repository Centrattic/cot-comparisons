She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend na\u00efve. The situation is a bit complex. The girlfriend has a lot of trauma from her upbringing and past experiences. Her parents were abusive, anti-vax, and taught her harmful things. The coaches also manipulated her about her body. Now she's in college, trying to educate herself, but the author finds her clueless in certain areas.\n\nFirst, the author calls her na\u00efve, which she takes as an accusation. The key here is whether the author is wrong to do so. The girlfriend has a history of being manipulated and abused, which might affect her ability to see things clearly. The author points out that she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her. That's a big red flag, but maybe she was in denial or hadn't had the right insight yet.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but the way he responds\u2014calling her na\u00efve\u2014might be hurtful. He uses a confrontational tone, which could be dismissive of her past trauma. The girlfriend is actively working on unlearning the harmful messages she received, which takes time and support. Telling someone they're na\u00efve, especially in a relationship, can feel like an attack on their intelligence or worth, which might be damaging given her history of being belittled by coaches and family.\n\nAlso, the example he gives about the fitness comment shows that she's internalized negative messages about her body. His response was to say her coaches were lying, which might not be helpful. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, a more supportive approach might be to acknowledge her struggle and offer encouragement rather than criticism. The author might not realize the emotional impact of his words, especially considering her background. So, even if his intentions are to help, his method is hurtful and ineffective. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
