She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves him calling his girlfriend \"na\u00efve\" because she didn't realize her parents were abusive and had been manipulated by her coaches.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend had a really tough upbringing. Her parents were abusive, stole from her, and were anti-vax, conservative, religious. She was in an environment that spread hate and misinformation. Her gymnastics coaches also contributed to her body image issues. Now she's in college, trying to educate herself and take control of her health, but there are gaps in her understanding of certain things.\n\nThe author gets frustrated when she doesn't see the obvious, like realizing her parents' abuse or believing the coaches' negative messages about her body. He used the term \"na\u00efve\" and criticized her, which upset her. She's working on healing and unlearning harmful teachings, but it's a process.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. So, using the term \"na\u00efve\" here might not be the best approach. The girlfriend's background is filled with manipulation and trauma, so her not recognizing abuse or internalizing harmful messages isn't just naivety\u2014it's a result of her upbringing. The author's frustration is understandable, but calling her na\u00efve could be dismissive of her struggles and the lasting impact of her experiences.\n\nHe should be more empathetic, considering the trauma and the time it takes to heal. His approach might come off as judgmental instead of supportive. Even though his intentions might be to help her see the truth, the way he communicates it matters. He needs to validate her efforts and recognize that unlearning is a complex process, especially with such a history.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not accounting for the depth of her trauma and the challenges she's facing in overcoming it. His frustration is valid, but his method of addressing it isn't helpful or kind in this context.\n"
