She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old guy whose girlfriend is also 21. She had a really tough upbringing with abusive parents who were anti-vaxxers and conservative, sending her to a school with harmful propaganda. She was also a gymnast whose coaches made her feel bad about her body, leading to an eating disorder. Now, she's in college, trying to educate herself on progressive topics and taking care of her health. But the author is frustrated because she's \"na\u00efve\" in some ways. For example, she didn't realize her parents were abusive until he told her, and she still struggles with body image issues from her coaches' lies.\n\nThe key issue here is whether calling her na\u00efve was wrong. The author says he snapped when she mentioned her coaches' comments, leading to an argument where she got upset. He feels bad but is still frustrated by her \"cluelessness\" despite her being smart academically.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The girlfriend was raised in an environment where she was manipulated and abused. Her coaches lied to her about her body to control her eating. It's understandable that she's still adjusting to seeing herself accurately. The author might think her not seeing obvious things is na\u00efve, but maybe he's not considering the trauma she's been through. Trauma can affect how someone perceives reality and their self-image. He's criticizing her for not being able to see through the lies she was fed for years, which might be unrealistic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to support her, which is good, but his approach might be harsh. Instead of calling her na\u00efve, maybe he should be more patient and understanding. Using the word \"na\u00efve\" could come off as dismissive of her struggles. He's in a position where he can help her, but his frustration is valid because he sees things clearly that she can't yet. However, the way he expressed his frustration might have hurt her feelings. \n\nAlso, when he told her her parents were abusive and that their stealing and bullying wasn't normal, she was shocked. That shows she hasn't had the same perspective as him. So, when he points out that her coaches lied to her about her body, her reaction is based on deep-seated trauma. He might need to approach these topics with more empathy. \n\nIs he wrong for feeling frustrated? Maybe not, but the way he lashed out by calling her na\u00efve is likely the problem. It's possible he's not fully appreciating the impact of her past on her current mindset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's in a relationship where his partner has experienced significant trauma, his response might be valid in terms of feeling frustrated but invalid in terms of how he expressed it. \n\nIn situations where someone has a history of trauma, using harsh words like \"na\u00efve\" could be seen as dismissive and not taking into account the challenges she's overcoming. The author might benefit from a more compassionate approach, helping her without judgment. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for responding in a way that's hurtful without considering her background.\n"
