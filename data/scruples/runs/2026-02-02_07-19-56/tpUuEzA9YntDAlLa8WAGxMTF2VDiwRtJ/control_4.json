She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn\u2019t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so na\u00efve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can\u2019t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She\u2019s naturally skinny, but she doesn\u2019t see it at all and it\u2019s almost like she can\u2019t see it even if she tries. It\u2019s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn\u2019t understanding. She\u2019s a brilliant girl academically and she\u2019s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she\u2019s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t get bulky overnight, and you\u2019re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you\u2019re really lean and probably don\u2019t tend to get bulky.\u201d She said, \u201cmy coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat\u201d and I said \u201cyour coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn\u2019t eat. How can you be so na\u00efve about everything?\u201d \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she\u2019s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it\u2019s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it\u2019s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe scenario involves a 21-year-old guy and his girlfriend, also 21. She had a really tough upbringing with abusive parents who were anti-vaxxers and conservative/religious. They sent her to a school with harmful ideologies. Additionally, she was a gymnast and faced body image issues from coaches who told her she was fat. Now, in college, she's trying to educate herself on the things she missed, like recognizing her parents' abuse and her own mental health. \n\nThe author is frustrated because he feels she's na\u00efve. He called her that after a conversation about her body image, where she was worried about getting bulky. He pointed out her coaches were manipulating her. She got upset, and he's conflicted because he feels bad but also frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong to call her na\u00efve. The key factors here are her background. She's had a lot of trauma and misinformation. Her parents' abuse wasn't recognized by her until the author pointed it out. Her coaches' manipulation led to eating disorders. She's working on undoing all that, which is a process. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but calling someone na\u00efve in that context might not be helpful. It's possible he's not considering the long-term effects of her upbringing. Even though he's trying to help her see the truth, his approach could be harsh. The term \"na\u00efve\" might come off as dismissive of her efforts and the challenges she's faced. \n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's trying to support her by pointing out the manipulation. The problem might be in the delivery rather than the intent. But given her history, the term \"na\u00efve\" could be hurtful and not account for the trauma she's overcoming. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not being empathetic enough. However, some might argue B (No) because his intentions are good. But the key is how he communicated his concern. Using \"na\u00efve\" seems critical rather than supportive, which isn't helpful for someone still healing. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
