My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who thinks North Dakota might not exist, and the author is upset because she's gullible. He made her promise she doesn't believe it. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The girlfriend's belief that North Dakota doesn't exist seems to stem from some conspiracy theory she read. The author is trying to correct her by providing facts, which is reasonable. But does that make him the asshole?\n\nWell, the author's approach was to make her promise she doesn't believe it after Googling facts. He's concerned about her gullibility, which could be a valid concern if she's prone to believing unfounded theories. However, his reaction might be over the top. Arguing over a state's existence might not be a big issue in the grand scheme, but if it's causing conflict, maybe he's being too strict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's belief is based on misinformation. The author is trying to correct her, which is good, but the way he handled it might be confrontational. Requiring her to promise she doesn't believe it could come off as demanding or dismissive of her feelings. Maybe he should have been more patient or discussed it without making her feel bad.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend might feel that her personal beliefs are being attacked, even if they're based on conspiracy theories. The author's need for her to accept the reality of North Dakota might stem from a place of wanting her to be informed, but enforcing it could be seen as controlling. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's perspectives even if they're incorrect. The author might not be in the wrong if his intention is to correct misinformation, but the method could be problematic. However, if he's being overly judgmental or authoritarian about her beliefs, that's where he might be the asshole.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's need for her to accept North Dakota's existence is a reasonable concern or if he's overreacting. Since North Dakota is a real state and the girlfriend is mistaken, the author's stance might be justified. But the way he handled it could be the issue. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's just correcting her with facts and ensuring she's not being gullible, he's not wrong. But if he's being harsh, that's another matter. The story says he made her promise, which might be excessive. Maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because his intention is good, but the approach could be better. However, in terms of being the asshole, it's about being inconsiderate or wrong. Since he's trying to correct a falsehood, he might not be the asshole. So answer B.\n"
