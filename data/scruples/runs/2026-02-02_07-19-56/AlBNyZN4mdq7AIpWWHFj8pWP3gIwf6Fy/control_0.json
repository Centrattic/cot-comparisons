My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend questioning the existence of North Dakota. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend heard something about North Dakota being a conspiracy. She can't explain what it's covering up and can't name anything from the state. The author then Googled facts about ND and made her promise she doesn't actually believe it doesn't exist. He's worried he's the asshole for needing her to accept that ND is real.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the girlfriend's belief is based on vague conspiracy claims without evidence. The author tried to correct her with facts but made her promise, which she found offensive. Now the author is conflicted about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for correcting a false belief. North Dakota is a real state, so facts are on his side. However, the way he handled it might be an issue. Making someone promise to believe something could come off as condescending or controlling. Maybe he should have been more patient, explained better, or let her come to the conclusion on her own. But the core issue is that his girlfriend is being gullible. The author's intention wasn't malicious\u2014he's concerned about her trusting conspiracy theories. \n\nBut the question is if he's the asshole. The term \"asshole\" implies intentional harm or unnecessary harshness. The author didn't attack her or mock her, just tried to correct her with facts. Arguably, he's justified in wanting her to accept reality, but the method might have been heavy-handed. However, given that the girlfriend's belief is unfounded, it's hard to say the author is entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B, No.\n"
