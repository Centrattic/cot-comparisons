My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for needing their girlfriend to believe that North Dakota exists. The situation is that the girlfriend mentioned North Dakota might be a conspiracy, and the author tried to convince her by Googling facts and making her promise she doesn't actually believe it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the girlfriend's belief that North Dakota might not exist, the author's response by providing facts, and the girlfriend thinking the author is an asshole for that. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The author is concerned about their partner's gullibility. But does that make them the asshole? Well, maybe the author is right to be concerned because believing in a conspiracy that a real state doesn't exist could indicate a problem with critical thinking. However, the way the author handled it might be an issue. They made her promise, which could come off as controlling or dismissive.\n\nWait, but the girlfriend initiated the conversation by asserting something that's clearly false. The author's response was to provide evidence, which is reasonable. However, insisting on a promise might be overstepping. Maybe the author should have just corrected the belief without making it a demand. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend thinks the author is an asshole because he insisted on her belief. But maybe the author's intent was to address the gullibility, which is a valid concern. However, the method of making her promise might not be the best approach. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to correct a false belief. But maybe the approach was too confrontational. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship and how they handle disagreements. Since the author is defending against the accusation of being an asshole, the answer would hinge on whether their actions were reasonable. \n\nConsidering that the author tried to reason with facts and the girlfriend was the one with the baseless belief, the author's actions might not be in the wrong. However, making her promise to believe could be seen as controlling. But the main issue is the belief itself. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is addressing a false belief with facts, which is reasonable, even if the method could be improved. The girlfriend's belief is the problem, not the author's response.\n"
