My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The situation involves the author's girlfriend believing North Dakota might not exist, and the author trying to convince her otherwise, even making her promise she doesn't actually think it's not real.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend's belief that North Dakota is a conspiracy is unfounded. The author is frustrated that she's gullible and took action by researching and insisting she acknowledge the state's existence. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). So, I need to evaluate the author's actions. The author's main issue is with the girlfriend's gullibility, not necessarily her belief itself. But is it wrong to want a partner to not believe in conspiracy theories? \n\nWell, the girlfriend's belief is irrational, as North Dakota is a well-known state. The author's response was to educate her and get a promise not to believe it. That seems reasonable. However, the author's frustration that they have to be in this situation and the insistence on the promise might come off as controlling or dismissive of the girlfriend's autonomy. Maybe the author should have just calmly informed her without making her promise. But given the context, the author is concerned about their partner's critical thinking skills, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend's belief is a joke or a way to get a reaction, the author's response might be over the top. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The author tried to reason with her, which is appropriate. Making her promise might be unnecessary, but the main issue is the belief itself. Since the author is acting to correct a misinformation, they're probably not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
