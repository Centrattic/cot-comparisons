My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. He tried to convince her by Googling facts and made her promise she doesn't actually believe it. She's upset, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend's belief that North Dakota might not exist seems to be based on some conspiracy theory she read, and she can't explain what it's covering up. The author is concerned about her gullibility and took steps to challenge her belief, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's belief and the author's response. The girlfriend's belief is clearly incorrect\u2014North Dakota is a real state. However, her belief might stem from misinformation or a misunderstanding. The author's approach was to confront her with facts and make her promise not to believe it. \n\nIs it wrong for him to want her to accept reality? Well, wanting someone to believe in factual truths isn't necessarily wrong. But the way he handled it\u2014making her promise and possibly being confrontational\u2014could be the issue. The AITA community often considers the tone and approach taken. If he was dismissive or belittled her, that's where he might be in the wrong. However, the post says he tried to get her to believe, and she eventually caved. \n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend's belief, while incorrect, might be a minor issue. The author's reaction might be over-the-top, treating a conspiracy theory as a serious problem in their relationship. Maybe the author should have been more patient or understanding of her confusion rather than insisting on a promise. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to be concerned about his partner's gullibility, especially if it leads to believing in baseless conspiracies. But the method of addressing it might be where the issue lies. Forcing a promise could come off as controlling, hence the \"asshole\" label.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for whether the action was reasonable given the context. The author's intent was to correct a false belief, which is understandable, but the approach might have been too harsh. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy in forming opinions was disregarded. Therefore, the author might be blamed for overreacting, even if his goal was valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he might have been too confrontational and insisted on a promise, which could be seen as disrespectful to her beliefs, even if they're incorrect.\n"
