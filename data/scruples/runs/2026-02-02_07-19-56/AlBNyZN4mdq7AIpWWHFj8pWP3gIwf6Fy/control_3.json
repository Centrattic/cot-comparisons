My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their girlfriend believe North Dakota exists. The situation is that the girlfriend thinks there's a conspiracy that North Dakota doesn't exist. The author researched facts and made her promise she doesn't really believe it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. The girlfriend's belief is a conspiracy theory. The author's reaction seems to be about correcting a false belief. But maybe the way he did it was too forceful? The girlfriend thinks he's an asshole because he made her promise she doesn't believe it. Maybe he should have approached it more gently instead of demanding a promise. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is being gullible to conspiracy theories, the author might be right to be concerned. However, enforcing a belief isn't the right approach. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author used Google facts, made her promise, and the girlfriend felt pressured. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's viewpoints and not force beliefs. Even if the belief is incorrect, making someone promise not to believe it could be seen as controlling. The author's justification is that he needs her to believe North Dakota exists because he's worried about her gullibility. However, the method of confrontation might be the issue here. \n\nSo, the answer likely hinges on whether the approach was too harsh. The author isn't wrong for wanting to correct a false belief, but using pressure tactics could make him the asshole. The girlfriend's belief is irrational, but the author's response might have been unkind. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he forced her to pledge instead of discussing it calmly.\n"
