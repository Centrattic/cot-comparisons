My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, which he finds concerning, and he made her promise she doesn't believe it. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the scenario. The girlfriend is expressing a conspiracy theory belief that North Dakota doesn't exist. The author responds by educating her with facts from Google and demands a promise she doesn't believe it. The key points are: the girlfriend's belief is unfounded and based on minimal knowledge, and the author's reaction is to correct her using facts and ensure her compliance.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't attacking her in a harmful way; he's trying to correct a false belief. However, the way he enforces a promise might come off as controlling. The girlfriend's belief is irrational, but the author's approach could be seen as overstepping if he's pressuring her to conform. On the other hand, he's addressing a potentially concerning level of gullibility. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and harm. The author's intent was to correct misinformation, not to belittle her. The harm here is minimal, but the method of making her promise could be problematic. However, since the belief is clearly unfounded and the author is using facts, it's more about protecting the relationship's foundation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to address a real issue (conspiracy thinking) and using facts. The girlfriend's belief is the problem, not his reaction. So the answer is B (No).\n"
