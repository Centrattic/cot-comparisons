My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend is questioning the existence of North Dakota. The author feels that this is a problem because she's being gullible, and he made her promise to believe in North Dakota's existence after Googling facts. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. North Dakota is a real U.S. state, so saying it doesn't exist is factually incorrect. The girlfriend's belief is based on some conspiracy theory she read, which she can't back up with evidence. The author is trying to correct her by providing facts. \n\nBut why does he need her to promise not to believe it? That seems a bit controlling. Maybe he's concerned about her gullibility and wants her to be more critical. However, forcing someone to accept a fact might not be the best approach. It could come off as dismissive of her feelings or the reason she's skeptical. \n\nThe girlfriend might have felt that the author was mocking her or not taking her concerns seriously. If she's into conspiracy theories, maybe she feels her views are being invalidated. The author's method of making her promise could be seen as authoritarian rather than supportive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to ground her in reality. There's a balance between respecting her views and correcting misinformation. If the author approached it with patience and understanding, maybe it would be better. But using a Google search and demanding a promise might not be the right way. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? Well, he's right that North Dakota exists, but his approach might have been condescending. The key issue is whether he overstepped by requiring a promise. People can have different beliefs, and while factual correction is okay, forcing someone to agree could be problematic. \n\nTherefore, the author's insistence on her promise might make him the asshole because he's being controlling rather than understanding. But maybe not if he's genuinely worried about her gullibility. It's a bit of a nuanced situation. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A, meaning he is the asshole, because he's being authoritarian in his response. However, others might argue that he's just correcting misinformation. But the way he handled it, making her promise, seems to cross a line.\n"
