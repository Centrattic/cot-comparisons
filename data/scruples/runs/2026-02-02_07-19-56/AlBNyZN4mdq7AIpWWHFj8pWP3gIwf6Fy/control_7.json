My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author then Googles facts about it and insists she promise she doesn't really believe it. The girlfriend is upset because he's making her promise, but the author thinks it's a problem that she's gullible.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are unreasonable. The key points are: the girlfriend's belief seems to be based on a conspiracy theory or lack of knowledge. The author is trying to correct a factual error. But does he have a right to demand she accept the truth?\n\nFrom a logic standpoint, North Dakota is a real state. The girlfriend's belief is incorrect. The author is trying to educate her, which is reasonable. However, the part where he makes her promise she doesn't believe it might be overstepping. Insisting on a promise could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her perspective, even if her belief is wrong. \n\nBut maybe in the context of a relationship, it's acceptable to correct misinformation. However, the way he did it\u2014by Googling facts and making her promise\u2014might come off as condescending. The girlfriend might feel disrespected, leading to tension. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone's partner has a conspiracy theory about a state's existence, that could be a red flag for gullibility or distrust in reality. The author might be justified in being concerned about that mindset. However, the method of addressing it is up for debate. \n\nIs the author wrong for needing her to accept the truth? Maybe not entirely, but the approach could be better. But the question is whether he's the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions were reasonable. If the author is trying to correct a belief that's harmful or based on misinformation, that's okay. But making someone promise to believe a fact might be seen as demanding compliance rather than fostering understanding. However, the girlfriend's belief is so outlandish that the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nMaybe the answer is B (no), because the author is correcting a factual error, which is reasonable, even if the method could be improved. The girlfriend's belief is problematic, so the author isn't the asshole for wanting her to accept reality. The problem is the girlfriend's gullibility, not the author's response.\n"
