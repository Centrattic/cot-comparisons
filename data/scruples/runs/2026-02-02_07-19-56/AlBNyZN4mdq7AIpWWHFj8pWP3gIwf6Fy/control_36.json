My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making his girlfriend promise to believe North Dakota exists. \n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend hears about North Dakota not existing, maybe from some conspiracy theory, but can't provide specifics. The author then Googles facts about ND and insists she promise she doesn't believe it. She eventually gives in, but he's still unsure.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is concerned about his partner's gullibility. He took action by researching and confronting her. He made her promise to believe ND exists. The girlfriend thinks he's an asshole for that.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the girlfriend's belief is based on misinformation. The author is trying to correct a false belief, which is reasonable. However, the way he handled it might be an issue. Insisting she promise to believe something, especially if it's a sensitive topic, could be seen as controlling. But the topic here is pretty trivial\u2014ND's existence. It's not a major political or personal issue. The author is upset about her gullibility, which is a valid concern in a relationship where trust in information matters. \n\nBut using a \"promise\" approach might be too forceful. Maybe a better approach is discussing sources and critical thinking. However, the author's intent wasn't malicious; he wanted her to accept a fact. Since ND is a real place, the action was to correct a false belief. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she was trying to be open, but the author's method might have been confrontational. Still, the core issue is a trivial conspiracy theory. The author isn't wrong for wanting her to accept reality. So, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because he's correcting misinformation, even if the method could be improved. The situation isn't serious enough to make him an asshole.\n"
