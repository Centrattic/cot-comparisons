My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and he made her promise she doesn't believe it. The user wants to know if he's the asshole (ITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend claims North Dakota is a conspiracy. The author responds by fact-checking and insisting she doesn't actually believe it. The core issue here is whether the author's reaction is reasonable or overstepping.\n\nThe author's actions involved googling facts and making her promise not to believe it. The girlfriend found this confrontational. Now, the key points: Is it the author's place to question his partner's beliefs? Can someone be gullible in believing a conspiracy like that? Is making her promise a reasonable step?\n\nConspiracy theories can be tricky. If someone genuinely believes something outlandish, even without evidence, does that make them wrong? The author is concerned about her gullibility, which might affect their relationship's trust. But forcing someone to renounce a belief could be seen as controlling.\n\nHowever, the author didn't physically threaten or coerce her; he just tried to reason and made her promise after discussion. The girlfriend's belief seems unfounded, so the author's concern isn't baseless. But the method of response\u2014demanding a promise\u2014might have been heavy-handed. Maybe he should have discussed it more gently instead of insisting on a promise.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is worried about her critical thinking for their future together, it's a valid concern. But the way he approached it might have been the problem. The humor in the original post (like \"I can't believe I'd be in this situation\") might indicate he's frustrated, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe partially. Pushing for a promise could come off as controlling. But the belief itself is so outlandish that he has a point. However, the way he handled it might be the issue. The answer might be B (No), because the author's concern is understandable, even if his approach could have been better. But the community often reacts strongly to controlling behavior, so maybe A (Yes). Hmm.\n"
