My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend thinking that North Dakota might not exist, and the author made her promise she doesn't actually believe that. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girl claims North Dakota is a conspiracy, but can't explain what it's covering up. The author researched facts about ND and made her promise she doesn't think it's not real. The author is worried he's an asshole for needing her to believe in ND's existence.\n\nSo, North Dakota is a real U.S. state. The girlfriend's belief seems to be based on misinformation or a conspiracy theory. The author is trying to correct her belief using facts. The key points here are whether the author's actions were reasonable. Making someone promise to believe in a state's existence might come off as overreacting, but the author is concerned about her gullibility. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the author is pointing out factual inaccuracies. However, the way he handled it\u2014making her promise\u2014could be seen as controlling. Maybe the problem is not just the content of her belief but how the author reacted. The girlfriend might feel disrespected if he's dismissing her views without understanding why she believes that. Maybe there's a deeper issue, like trust or communication problems. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong about North Dakota existing. His intention was to correct a false belief. But the method he used might be the problem. Insisting on a promise could be seen as authoritarian. The girlfriend's reaction (thinking he's an asshole) might stem from feeling that her autonomy was disrespected. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't wrong in wanting to correct the misinformation, but the approach taken might be problematic. However, the main issue is the validity of the belief. Since the state is real, the author is right factually. But in terms of relationship dynamics, maybe he should have handled it more gently. The question is whether he's the asshole. The answer might hinge on whether the method of correction is as important as the correction itself.\n"
