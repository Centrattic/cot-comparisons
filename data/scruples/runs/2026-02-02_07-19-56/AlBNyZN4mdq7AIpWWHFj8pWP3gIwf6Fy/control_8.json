My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend claims North Dakota might be a conspiracy and doesn't exist. The author then checks facts online and insists she promise she doesn't believe it, which she eventually does.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is the asshole (ITA) or not. The key points here are the girlfriend's belief and the author's reaction. The girlfriend's belief is based on no real evidence\u2014she can't explain what it's covering up or reference its presence on maps. The author's response is to fact-check and demand a promise that she doesn't actually believe it. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to require her to believe in North Dakota's existence. The author's concern is about the girlfriend being gullible. However, the author's approach might be seen as dismissive or overreacting. The girlfriend might have a different perspective, maybe she was joking or making a metaphorical point, but the author took it seriously. \n\nIn such situations, it's important to approach with understanding and not assume malice. The author's need for her to \"believe in North Dakota\" could be coming off as controlling or not respecting her views, even if they're based on misinformation. The girlfriend's right to her own opinions, even if they're incorrect, should be considered. The author's response, while factually correct, could have been handled more gently. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they reacted harshly rather than addressing the underlying issue with empathy. People can have different levels of knowledge or misconceptions, and the partner should handle it with patience, not insistence on a promise.\n"
