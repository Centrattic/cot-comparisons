My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and he made her promise she doesn't actually believe that. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The girlfriend brought up the idea that North Dakota is a conspiracy, even though she can't explain what it's covering up. The author then Googled facts about it and made her promise she doesn't really think it doesn't exist. The girlfriend thinks he's an asshole for that, and he's questioning if he's wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether making someone believe a factual reality (that North Dakota exists) is unreasonable. From a factual standpoint, North Dakota is a real state in the U.S. It's well-known, has a population, is on every map, etc. So the girlfriend's belief that it might not exist is based on some sort of conspiracy theory, which is not supported by evidence.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for insisting she accept that North Dakota exists. The author's position is that it's a problem if his partner is gullible enough to believe such a thing. He tried to correct her, and she eventually agreed, but he's unsure if he was right to do so.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here: the author is not in the wrong for correcting a factual inaccuracy. It's reasonable to challenge a belief that's based on misinformation. However, the way he approached it might be a factor. Making her \"promise\" he needs her to accept the fact could come off as controlling or dismissive of her perspective. But in the context of the situation, he was trying to correct a belief that's clearly incorrect.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is based on a conspiracy theory without evidence, which is a known problem. People who believe in such theories often hold onto them despite evidence to the contrary. The author's response is to provide factual information and get her to acknowledge the truth, which is a responsible approach. However, if he forced her or made her feel bad, that could be an issue. But according to the story, she eventually caved, so maybe she wasn't forced but convinced.\n\nIn terms of being \"the asshole,\" it's about whether his reaction was unreasonable. Since he's pointing out a factual error and trying to get her to accept reality, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's belief is the issue here, not the author's response to it. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
