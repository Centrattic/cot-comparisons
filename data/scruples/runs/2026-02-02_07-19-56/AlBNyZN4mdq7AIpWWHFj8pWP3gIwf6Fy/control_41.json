My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their girlfriend promise to believe North Dakota exists. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's girlfriend questions the existence of North Dakota, thinking it's a conspiracy. The author then researches facts and insists she promise she doesn't believe it. The girlfriend thinks he's the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota's existence.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the girlfriend's belief is based on misinformation or conspiracy theories, which can be problematic. But the author's approach might have been condescending. Insisting someone promise to believe a basic fact could come off as dismissive of her perspective. \n\nHowever, the author's concern about her gullibility is valid. If someone is easily swayed by conspiracy theories, that can affect their judgment. But the way he handled it\u2014using Google facts and making her promise\u2014might not be the best approach. He could have been more patient or understanding.\n\nBut is he the asshole? The key is whether his actions were unreasonable. Insisting on factual accuracy isn't inherently wrong. However, making her promise to believe might be overstepping. The girlfriend's belief, even if incorrect, is her current stance, and forcing her to conform could be seen as controlling. The author might not be in the wrong, but his method could use improvement. The answer might be B (No), because he's not wrong for wanting her to accept a fact, but the approach is questionable. However, AITA often considers intent and impact. If he was condescending, that's a problem. But the core issue is her denying a real place, which he's right about. So maybe B is correct.\n"
