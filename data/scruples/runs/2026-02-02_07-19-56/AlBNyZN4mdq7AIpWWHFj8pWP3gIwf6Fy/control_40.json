My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's girlfriend started doubting that North Dakota exists, thinking it might be a conspiracy. The author then researched facts about North Dakota and insisted that the girlfriend promise not to believe it doesn't exist. The girlfriend thinks the author is an asshole for doing that. The author is asking if they're the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's belief that North Dakota might not exist seems to be based on some kind of conspiracy theory she read. She can't explain what it's covering up, and the author points out that North Dakota is on every map. The author's reaction is to research and confront her, making her promise not to hold that belief. \n\nNow, the key question here is whether the author is wrong for insisting on this. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's stance is based on misinformation or a fringe theory. The author is trying to correct that with facts. However, the author's approach might come across as controlling or dismissive. They made her promise not to believe it, which could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their partner's gullibility, which is a valid concern. But how to address it? Insisting on a promise might not be the best approach. A better way would be to discuss the facts calmly and encourage critical thinking without coercion.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be well-intentioned, but the method could be problematic. By making her promise, they might be undermining her ability to question things, even if the current question is based on a conspiracy. However, the girlfriend's belief is clearly unfounded, and the author is trying to correct that. \n\nBut the title of 'AITA' (Am I the Asshole) suggests that the author is looking for validation that they're not the bad one. The community often looks at intent and method. If the author's approach was aggressive or made the girlfriend feel belittled, that could be an issue. The fact that the author had to \"google facts\" and demand a promise might be seen as overstepping, even if the facts are correct. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's views is important. Even if a belief is incorrect, the way to address it matters. The author might not be wrong in wanting to correct misinformation, but the method of making a promise could be seen as controlling. Alternatively, the girlfriend's stance is clearly based on a conspiracy without evidence, so the author's concern is valid. \n\nI think the key point is the method. The author could have discussed the facts without making it a promise. By doing so, they might have been trying to enforce their view rather than encouraging her to think critically on her own. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing a baseless conspiracy belief with facts. However, the approach of making a promise could be seen as problematic. But in the context of the AITA style, where the person is looking for validation that they're not the asshole, the community might side with B, considering the girlfriend's belief is unfounded and the author's intent is to correct misinformation. However, if the method was controlling, maybe A. But in the AITA community, often they look at the facts and intentions over the method. Since the author's intent is genuine, they might not be the asshole.\n"
