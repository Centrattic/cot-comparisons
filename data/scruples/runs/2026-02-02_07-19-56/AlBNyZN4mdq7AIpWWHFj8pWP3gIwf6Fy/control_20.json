My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author tries to convince her by Googling facts and making her promise she doesn't actually believe it. The question is whether the author is the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend's belief is based on something she read about a conspiracy. She can't explain what it's covering up, and she knows almost nothing about the state. The author is concerned because he thinks her gullibility is an issue. He tries to correct her by providing facts, which seems reasonable. But is there a problem here?\n\nWell, the author's approach was to make her promise she doesn't actually believe ND doesn't exist. That might come off as condescending. Maybe he shouldn't have made it a requirement for her to promise that. Also, the girlfriend might feel that her views were dismissed without proper consideration. Even if the author's information is correct, the way he handled it could be seen as controlling or not respecting her opinion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a relationship where he's concerned about his partner's belief in conspiracy theories. It's natural to want to correct misinformation, especially if it's clearly wrong. However, the method he used\u2014making her promise\u2014might be overstepping. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect, so maybe the author should have approached it with more patience and understanding instead of demanding a promise.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is that she thinks he's an asshole because he Googled facts and insisted she promise. It's possible that the author could have handled the situation better without making it about her gullibility. Maybe he should have focused on explaining the facts without making it a confrontation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention to correct misinformation isn't wrong, the way he handled it by making her promise might be. So he might be in the wrong for the approach rather than the content. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
