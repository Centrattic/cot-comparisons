My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and the author made her promise to believe it exists. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend claimed North Dakota is a conspiracy, but couldn't explain how. The author researched facts about it and made her promise to believe it exists. She caved, but the author isn't sure if she really does.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author's reaction to the girlfriend's belief, the method used (making her promise), and the girlfriend's change of stance.\n\nThe author's concern is about the girlfriend's gullibility. However, the girlfriend's belief might stem from misinformation or lack of knowledge. The author's response was to present facts and demand a promise. While it's reasonable to correct misinformation, demanding a promise could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend might feel pressured, leading her to agree without genuinely believing it. \n\nAlso, the author's insistence might not address the root cause of her belief. Maybe she was influenced by some conspiracy theories. The author's approach is more about getting compliance rather than understanding. This could be seen as dismissive of her perspective, even if it's based on a misunderstanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a relationship where mutual trust and facts are important. If the girlfriend can't accept basic geographical facts, it might be a red flag for the author. However, the way the author handled it\u2014using pressure and making a promise\u2014might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nIn terms of the question, the main issue is whether the author was wrong in making her girlfriend promise to believe North Dakota exists. The answer depends on whether the method was appropriate. Since the author used forceful tactics, it's possible he's being overbearing. But if he's concerned about her gullibility, it's not entirely his fault either.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be the asshole, but his method could be questioned. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the author is trying to correct a false belief, even if the approach was heavy-handed, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But if the problem is about how he handled it, maybe A is the answer. Hmm. Alternatively, since the girlfriend was mistaken and the author tried to correct her, maybe B is correct. I'm a bit torn here. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for needing her to believe. If he's just correcting a wrong belief, no. But if he's being controlling, yes. The way he made her promise might be the issue. So, maybe A is the answer.\n"
