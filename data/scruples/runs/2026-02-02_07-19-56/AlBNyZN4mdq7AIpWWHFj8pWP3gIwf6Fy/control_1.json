My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author then Googles facts about North Dakota and makes her promise she doesn't actually believe it's not real. The question is whether the author is wrong for needing her to believe in North Dakota.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. North Dakota is a well-known U.S. state. It's on every map, has a government, cities, etc. The girlfriend's belief that it might not exist seems to be based on some conspiracy theory or lack of knowledge. The author is clearly trying to correct a false belief. But the key here is how he went about it. He made her promise to believe in North Dakota's existence after Googling facts. \n\nIs this overstepping? Well, in a relationship, it's normal to have differing opinions, but when one person's belief is factually incorrect and potentially harmful or based on misinformation, it's reasonable to correct them. However, the way the author approached it might be the problem. Forcing someone to 'promise' to believe something could come off as controlling or dismissive of her feelings. Instead of a respectful discussion, he might have been aggressive in his approach.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's stance, while illogical, might stem from a misunderstanding or a joke. The author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate if she was just being playful or making a point. The humor or metaphor in saying a state doesn't exist might be lost on the author, leading to a serious confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about his partner's gullibility. It's valid to be worried if someone believes in conspiracy theories, as that can affect other areas of life. But the method of correction is important. Arguing with facts is okay, but demanding a promise might not be the healthiest approach in a relationship. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and open dialogue rather than demands.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's mistake was probably in how he handled the situation\u2014trying to force a promise rather than having a respectful conversation. Therefore, he might be the asshole for being too controlling, even if his concern was based on valid facts.\n"
