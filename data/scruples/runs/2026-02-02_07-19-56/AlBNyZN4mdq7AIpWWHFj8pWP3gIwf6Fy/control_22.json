My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and he made her promise to believe it exists. The user wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend claims North Dakota is a conspiracy, can't explain what it's covering up, and the author challenges her by Googling facts and making her promise to believe it exists. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's a problem if his partner is gullible enough to believe such a thing. But is it his place to enforce her beliefs? The girlfriend's belief, while incorrect, isn't necessarily harmful. The author's response was to confront her and demand a promise, which might come off as dismissive or controlling. \n\nHe mentions she caved after a few minutes, but he's still not convinced. The core issue is whether the author overstepped by pressuring her into accepting a factual reality. While North Dakota's existence is a fact, the way he handled the situation could be seen as treating her belief as a trivial issue rather than engaging with her reasons for doubting. Maybe there's more to her perspective that he didn't consider. \n\nOn the other hand, it's reasonable to correct misinformation. However, the method he used\u2014making her promise\u2014might be where he's wrong. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being undermined. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach could be seen as authoritarian. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the method of correction was appropriate. Since he didn't just provide information but required a promise, that could be the asshole moment. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
