My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend is questioning the existence of North Dakota, thinking it's a conspiracy. The author then Googles facts about it and makes her promise she doesn't actually believe it's not real.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the girlfriend would think that. Maybe she encountered some conspiracy theories online? But the author is reacting by trying to correct her, using facts. The girlfriend is probably being a bit gullible or just making a joke, but the author takes it seriously. \n\nNow, the author's approach here is to research the facts and confront her. But is that overreacting? The girlfriend didn't believe it at first, maybe she was just being playful or skeptical. The author might be overreacting by making her promise to believe North Dakota exists. \n\nWait, the author's reasoning is that if his partner is gullible enough to think North Dakota doesn't exist, that's a problem. But is it really? Maybe she was just being facetious or didn't know much about it. The author is using the fact that they can name things from North Dakota as proof, but that's a bit of a logical fallacy. Just because someone can name things doesn't prove the state exists, but the existence is well-established. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being reasonable. The girlfriend's belief is based on misinformation or misunderstanding. The author is trying to correct that with facts, which is good, but maybe the way he's doing it is too harsh. Making her promise to believe in North Dakota's existence might be seen as controlling. \n\nAlso, the author is labeling the girlfriend as gullible, which could be a bit judgmental. The girlfriend might not be wrong in questioning things, but the specific claim about a state not existing is unfounded. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for correcting a false belief, but the method of making her promise might be problematic. However, in the context of a relationship, it's about how they handle disagreements. If the author was respectful and just sharing facts, maybe it's okay. But if he's being condescending, then maybe. The question is if he's the asshole. Since the girlfriend's belief is clearly incorrect, the author's actions are reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
