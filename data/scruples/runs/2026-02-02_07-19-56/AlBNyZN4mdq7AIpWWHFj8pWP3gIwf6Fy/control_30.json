My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author then Googled facts about North Dakota and made her promise to believe it exists. The question is if the author was wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. North Dakota is a well-known U.S. state. If someone is questioning its existence, that's pretty outlandish. The girlfriend's belief seems to be based on a conspiracy theory she read. The author is concerned about her gullibility and tries to correct her by providing facts. He made her promise to believe in North Dakota's existence after she caved.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's about respecting each other's views. The author's approach was to confront her belief directly. But maybe he should have been more patient or understanding. However, the girlfriend's stance is questionable. The author is concerned about her trusting conspiracy theories, which is a valid concern. But making her promise might be overstepping. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't wrong for wanting to correct a false belief. On the other, the way he did it (Google facts and demand a promise) might be seen as condescending or dismissive. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being undermined. \n\nBut the girlfriend's belief is based on a conspiracy without evidence. The author is trying to ground her in reality, which is reasonable. However, the method could be better. Forcing someone to promise to believe something isn't a good approach. It's better to have a respectful discussion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points: the girlfriend's belief is unfounded, the author tried to correct her with facts, but the way he did it might be heavy-handed. The question is whether he's the asshole. In these AITA contexts, being overly confrontational or authoritarian can be seen as wrong. But the alternative is allowing conspiracy theories to go unchecked, which is also problematic. \n\nThe author's main issue is that he made her promise, which could be seen as controlling. But the underlying issue is her belief in a conspiracy. So, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author is justified in trying to correct a false belief, even if the method could be improved. However, if the method was too harsh, maybe A. But given the context, the author's concern is valid, and the girlfriend's belief is irrational. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
