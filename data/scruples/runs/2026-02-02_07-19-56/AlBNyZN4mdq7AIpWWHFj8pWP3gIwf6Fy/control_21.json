My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author then Googles facts about North Dakota and insists that his girlfriend promise she doesn't actually believe it's not real. The girlfriend thinks he's being an asshole because he's doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions are reasonable. The key points here are about belief in a real state and the pressure to conform to that belief. The girlfriend has a belief that North Dakota might be a conspiracy, which is obviously not true. The author is trying to correct her by providing facts. But is he being unreasonable in doing so?\n\nWell, the girlfriend's belief is based on a conspiracy theory. The author is using factual evidence to counter that. It's reasonable to engage in a discussion when someone holds a false belief. However, the author went a step further by making her promise she doesn't believe it. That part might be where he's being overbearing. Insisting on a promise might come off as controlling, especially in a relationship. The fact that she caved in after a few minutes suggests she was uncomfortable with the pressure. \n\nAlso, the author is calling her gullible for believing such a thing. That could be seen as condescending. It's one thing to correct misinformation, another to make someone feel belittled for having that belief, even if it's unfounded. The girlfriend's reaction is that he's being an asshole because of this pressure. So the question is: is the pressure and the insistence on a promise justified?\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's views even when you disagree. However, when it comes to factual matters, there's a point where you need to correct misinformation if it's harmful or based on conspiracy. But the way the author approached it\u2014using Google facts and demanding a promise\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author might be right about the facts, but the approach is what's in question here.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the method used was appropriate. The author isn't wrong for wanting to correct a false belief, but he might be wrong in the way he enforced it. The girlfriend's belief is clearly incorrect, but the author's insistence on her promise could be seen as controlling. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of the approach rather than the content of the argument.\n"
