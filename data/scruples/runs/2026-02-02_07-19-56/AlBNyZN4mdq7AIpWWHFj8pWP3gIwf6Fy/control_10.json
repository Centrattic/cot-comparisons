My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author says she thinks it's a conspiracy and can't explain what it's covering up. He challenges her by saying he can name things from North Dakota and then insists she promise she doesn't actually believe it doesn't exist. He ends up convincing her, but isn't sure if he's the asshole for making her believe in North Dakota.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's belief is based on something she read, but she can't back it up. The author's response was to fact-check and demand a promise that she doesn't believe it. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable to correct misinformation. If someone you care about is spreading false information, it's important to address it. However, the way he did it\u2014insisting she promise not to believe it\u2014might come off as controlling. Also, the girlfriend's belief is clearly a joke or a conspiracy theory, so the author's reaction might be over-the-top. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't trying to control her thoughts, just ensure she's not acting on false beliefs. The situation is trivial because North Dakota's existence is factual. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe his approach was harsh. The girlfriend's initial comment was likely a joke or a conspiracy theory, and taking it seriously and pressuring her for a promise could be seen as overreacting. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's response was disproportionate. Insisting on a promise might be the asshole move here. The correct approach would be to inform her facts without forcing a promise. Since the author's actions were about correcting a clearly false belief in a factual state, but the method was controlling, maybe he's the asshole. But I'm a bit confused because correcting misinformation is good, but the way he did it might be bad. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was being unreasonable, the author isn't wrong to push back. But the situation seems trivial. The author's insistence on a promise might be unnecessary. So, the answer could be that he's not in the wrong because he's correcting a factual error, but maybe there's a balance. However, given the nature of the question, the girlfriend's belief is clearly wrong, so maybe the author isn't the asshole. \n\nBut another angle: making someone promise something about their beliefs might be authoritarian. The answer could be that the author is not in the wrong because he's ensuring she's not gullible, but others might see it as controlling. The community might side with the author here because the belief is factually incorrect. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was being humorous and the author took it seriously, he might be the asshole. \n\nI think the key is that the author's actions were necessary to correct a false belief, but the way he did it might be the issue. However, since the belief is so outlandish, the author isn't wrong for wanting to correct it. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend was joking and the author took it too seriously, maybe A. But the question says she \"thinks\" it's a conspiracy, not that she's joking. So, the author's response is appropriate. Thus, answer B.\n"
