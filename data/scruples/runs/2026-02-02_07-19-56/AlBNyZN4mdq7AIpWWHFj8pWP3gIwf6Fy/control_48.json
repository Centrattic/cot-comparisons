My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for needing their girlfriend to believe North Dakota exists.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend claims North Dakota might be a conspiracy. That's a bit strange because North Dakota is a well-known state. The author then Googles facts and confronts her, making her promise to believe it exists. The girlfriend thinks the author is an asshole for this.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are based on the belief that his partner's gullibility is a red flag. But is it reasonable to demand someone to believe in a state's existence? Maybe the author is overreacting. The girlfriend's initial comment could be a joke or a misunderstanding, but the author took it seriously and tried to enforce a \"promise.\" That might come off as controlling. Also, the author's approach was to pressure her into agreeing rather than calmly discussing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about his partner being gullible, which could affect their relationship if she believes in other conspiracies. However, reacting by making her promise something might not be the best approach. It's possible the girlfriend was making a joke, and the author took it too seriously. The situation is trivial, so overreacting could make the author look like the asshole here. \n\nThe key points are: the author's need for control, the triviality of the topic, and the method used to address it. The answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because the approach was unnecessary and controlling, even if the concern is understandable.\n"
