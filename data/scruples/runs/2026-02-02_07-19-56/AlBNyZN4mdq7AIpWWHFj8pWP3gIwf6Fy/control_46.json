My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when his girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend claims North Dakota is a conspiracy, but can't explain what it's covering up. The author then Googles facts about ND and demands she promise she doesn't really believe it doesn't exist. She eventually gives in, but the author isn't sure.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole? Well, the main point is about whether he's in the wrong. The question is about the author's actions. The girlfriend's belief seems to be a conspiracy theory, which is baseless. The author is trying to correct her with factual information. That part seems reasonable. But he's making her promise she doesn't believe it, which might be overstepping. \n\nConspiracy theories are often rooted in distrust of information, but they're usually not true. The author is using facts to counter her. However, insisting she promise to believe otherwise could be seen as controlling. Maybe he should have been more patient or understanding of her skepticism, even if it's unfounded. \n\nAlso, the situation is a bit absurd. North Dakota is a real state; denying its existence is obviously false. But the way the author handled it\u2014forcing her to agree\u2014might come off as aggressive. The girlfriend might have a different way of processing information or might be joking. Maybe she didn't take it seriously, but the author took it too seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is concerned about her gullibility, it's reasonable to want her to verify information. But the method he used (making her promise) could be seen as authoritarian. The key is whether his approach was respectful. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not the asshole) because he's trying to correct a factual error. However, his method could be better, but the intent is to address a false belief. The main issue is the belief itself, not his response. So the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe could handle it more gently.\n"
