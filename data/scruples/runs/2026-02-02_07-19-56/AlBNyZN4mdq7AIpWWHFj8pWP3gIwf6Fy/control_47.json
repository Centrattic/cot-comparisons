My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for needing their girlfriend to believe North Dakota exists. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, citing some conspiracy theory. She can't explain what it's covering up, but she's skeptical. The author then Googles facts and insists she promise not to believe it anymore. The girlfriend thinks the author is an asshole because of this. The author is unsure if he's the asshole for making her believe in North Dakota.\n\nHmm. First, I need to assess whether the author's actions were reasonable. The girlfriend's belief seems unfounded. North Dakota is a well-known U.S. state; it's on all maps, has cities like Fargo, and so on. If someone is claiming it doesn't exist without any real evidence, that's pretty outlandish. The author is trying to correct a baseless conspiracy theory.\n\nBut wait, is it the author's responsibility to make his partner believe in reality? Relationships often involve addressing each other's beliefs. If one person holds a belief that's clearly false, the other might feel the need to correct it. However, the method used here might be the issue. The author made her promise not to believe it anymore, which could come across as controlling or dismissive of her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's initial belief is irrational. The author is concerned about her gullibility, which might be a valid concern in a relationship where critical thinking is valued. But the way he handled it might have been condescending. Instead of just correcting her, maybe he could have explained why the theory is baseless without making her feel attacked. Also, making her promise could be seen as authoritarian.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's actions were to counter a conspiracy theory with facts, which is reasonable. However, the insistence on a promise might be overstepping. People have different ways of handling relationships, but expecting someone to promise to believe something might not be healthy. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being undermined.\n\nBut North Dakota's existence is a fact, so pushing her to accept reality isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be the approach. But in terms of the question, is the author in the wrong? Well, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format often looks at whether someone's actions are reasonable and respectful. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might have been too forceful, leading the girlfriend to feel belittled. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because he insisted on her promise, which could be seen as controlling. Alternatively, B (No), because correcting a conspiracy theory is justified.\n\nWait, but the girlfriend herself thinks the author is an asshole for doing this. The author's reasoning is that he needs her to not be gullible. But maybe he should respect her right to have her own beliefs, even if they're wrong. However, if a belief is based on conspiracy theories, it's okay to question them. The line is between correcting misinformation and forcing someone to agree.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms. In many cases, it's acceptable to debate and provide evidence for facts. However, making someone promise to believe a fact might be crossing a line. The author's approach might be seen as overreacting, hence making him the asshole. So maybe A (Yes). But I'm a bit conflicted. Another angle: the author's actions are reasonable because he's addressing a conspiracy theory, which is harmful. So B (No).\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is if he's being controlling. If he's just pointing out facts and explaining, that's fine. But requiring a promise could be an issue. The girlfriend's right to her beliefs vs. the author's concern. In relationships, it's important to respect each other's views unless they're harmful. Since believing North Dakota doesn't exist isn't harmful, the author's insistence might be unnecessary. So, A (Yes, the author is wrong). But if the author is worried about her gullibility leading to other issues, maybe not. However, the method here is the problem. So probably A.\n"
