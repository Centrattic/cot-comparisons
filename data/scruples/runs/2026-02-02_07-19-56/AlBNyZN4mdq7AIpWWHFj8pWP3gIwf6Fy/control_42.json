My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that their girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and the author is trying to convince her otherwise. The question is whether the author is an asshole for needing her to believe North Dakota is real.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girlfriend is claiming that North Dakota's existence is a conspiracy. She can't provide any real reasons or evidence for that belief, just that she read something. The author then does some research and insists she agree that North Dakota exists, which she eventually does. The author is worried that his girlfriend is too gullible and that this is an issue in their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's belief is based on something she read without critical evaluation. The author's response is to present facts and require her to acknowledge the state's existence. The girlfriend feels upset because he's being an asshole for making her do that.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Well, is it reasonable for the author to be concerned about his partner's gullibility? Maybe. But is he wrong for trying to correct a false belief? It's a bit of a trivial issue\u2014North Dakota's existence isn't a big conspiracy. However, the way he handled it might be the problem. He required her to promise she doesn't believe it, which could come off as confrontational. Maybe a better approach was to discuss it without making her feel attacked. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone's partner believes something clearly false without evidence, it's natural to want to correct them. But the key is how he approached it. By making her \"promise\" and implying she was wrong in a way that caused conflict, maybe the author is being too harsh. The girlfriend might have been making a joke or was being facetious, and the author took it seriously and escalated it. \n\nAlso, the situation is a bit absurd. North Dakota is a well-known state. If the girlfriend was joking or being sarcastic, the author's serious response could be unwarranted. However, if she genuinely believes that, maybe the author is justified in wanting to correct her, but maybe not in the way he did it. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the method was appropriate. The author's approach might have been over the top. Insisting she promise could be seen as controlling. Instead of forcing her to agree, maybe a more patient discussion would have been better. The author's concern about gullibility is valid, but the way he addressed it might make him the asshole here. So, likely answer A (the author is in the wrong), but maybe the answer is B? Wait, the question is whether the author is wrong. If the author is in the wrong, answer A. If not, B.\n\nHmm. Let me check the original question again. The author's problem is that he needed her to promise she doesn't believe it. That seems to be the crux. The girlfriend might have been making a joke, and the author took it seriously and made a big deal out of it. If the situation is trivial, the author's reaction is disproportionate. Hence, he's the asshole. So answer A.\n"
