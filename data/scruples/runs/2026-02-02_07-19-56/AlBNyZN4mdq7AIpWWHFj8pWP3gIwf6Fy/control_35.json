My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is claiming North Dakota doesn't exist, or is a conspiracy. The author then googles facts about it and makes her promise she doesn't believe it. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is questioning the existence of a U.S. state. That seems like a conspiracy theory. The author is reacting by trying to correct her with facts. The girlfriend thinks that the author is being an asshole by making her promise to believe in North Dakota.\n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, if the girlfriend is being gullible or has some sort of unfounded belief, the author might be right to challenge that. However, the way the author approached it could matter. If the author is being condescending or not respecting her views, maybe. But in this case, the author is using facts and trying to get her to cede the point. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's belief is based on something she read, but she can't back it up. The author is concerned about her gullibility. Maybe the author is right to be concerned because believing in such a conspiracy could affect trust in other areas. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is the asshole. The author is trying to educate and make her promise, which might come off as demanding. However, if the belief is harmful or baseless, it's reasonable to address it. The author isn't being violent or abusive, just presenting facts. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for believing a conspiracy, but the author is trying to correct that. \n\nSo the answer might be B, no, the author isn't the asshole. It's reasonable to correct a false belief, especially when it's a conspiracy about a real place. However, maybe the author should have been more patient or gentle. But the situation doesn't indicate that the author was hostile. Instead, he used facts and wanted her to promise, which could be seen as reasonable.\n"
