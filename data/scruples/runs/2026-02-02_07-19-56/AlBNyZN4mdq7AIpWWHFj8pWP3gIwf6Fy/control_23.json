My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend questioning the existence of North Dakota, leading to a confrontation where the author insists she acknowledge it exists. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. North Dakota is a real U.S. state, well-documented in maps, history, and media. The girlfriend's belief that it might not exist seems based on a conspiracy theory she's encountered. The author's response is to research and insist she accept its reality.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's gullibility and the author's approach. The author's frustration is understandable, but how he handled the situation matters. He made her promise she didn't believe it and tried to convince her. While it's reasonable to correct false beliefs, the author's insistence on a promise and the confrontation might have been harsh. However, given that the belief is unfounded, the author isn't necessarily wrong to address it. \n\nConsidering the AITA context, the question is whether the author overreacted. The girlfriend's stance is irrational, so the author's actions to correct her aren't unreasonable. But maybe there's a better way to handle it without confrontation. Still, the author's intent was to address a false belief, not to belittle her. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to correct a false belief, especially when it's based on conspiracy theories. The answer is B.\n"
