My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for needing their girlfriend to believe North Dakota exists. \n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend seems to doubt North Dakota's existence, despite it being a well-known U.S. state. The author confronts her, provides facts, and demands a promise she doesn't really believe it. The girlfriend then caved.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider if the author overreacted. The author's main issue is that their partner is gullible. But is it reasonable to expect someone to know basic geography? Maybe not. However, the author's approach\u2014demanding a promise and labeling the situation as needing her to \"believe in North Dakota\"\u2014might be seen as over the top. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's belief that North Dakota is a conspiracy is a bit absurd, but it's possible she was joking or making a point. The author's response could come across as dismissive or condescending. Relationships sometimes have moments where people make jokes or hypotheticals, and overreacting can create unnecessary tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their partner's gullibility, which is a valid concern. But the way they addressed it might be the problem. Insisting on a promise might feel controlling or patronizing. The key here is whether the method of addressing the belief was appropriate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The situation is a bit humorous, but the author's reaction might be seen as unnecessary. They could have handled it with more humor or understanding instead of confrontation. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
