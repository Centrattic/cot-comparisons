My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for needing their girlfriend to believe North Dakota exists. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, citing some conspiracy theory. The author, frustrated, Googled facts to prove it exists and made her promise she doesn't actually think it's fake. The girlfriend now thinks he's an asshole because of this.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n1. The girlfriend's belief is based on a conspiracy theory without evidence.\n2. The author feels this gullibility is a problem and took action to correct her.\n3. The author's approach involved Googling facts and making her promise to stop doubting ND's existence.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is right that North Dakota is a real state. It's well-established, has a government, cities like Bismarck, and is on all maps. The girlfriend's belief is fringe and lacks any factual basis. The author's intent was to correct a false belief, which seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, the method might be questionable. Making her promise to believe in ND's existence could come off as controlling or dismissive. Instead of a respectful discussion, he forced her to agree, which might not address the underlying issue of why she believed the conspiracy. Maybe she's just joking, or perhaps she has trust issues with mainstream information. The author's need for her to publicly commit to believing in ND could be seen as overreacting, even if the belief itself is wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the belief is objectively false, the author is justified in correcting it. However, the way he handled it\u2014using Google facts and making her promise\u2014might be seen as condescending or not respecting her autonomy if she was just being playful. But if she genuinely believes it, then correcting her is necessary.\n\nThe line here is between correcting a false belief (which is right) versus the method used (which could be wrong). But since the main point is the belief itself, and the author is right to challenge that, maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's being too rigid about her having to agree, that's where he might be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend was just making a joke, and the author took it too seriously. The story says she \"finally caved,\" implying she gave in under pressure. If she was just joking, forcing her to confirm could be unnecessary. But if she genuinely believes it, then the author is right to correct her.\n\nIn the end, the author's intent was to ensure she understood the reality of ND's existence, which is valid. The method might not be the best, but the core issue is the false belief. So, the answer might be B (not the asshole) because the belief is wrong, and he's correcting it, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
