My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend thinking North Dakota might not exist, and the author trying to convince her otherwise by Googling facts and making her promise she doesn't believe it's not real.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girlfriend has a belief that North Dakota is a conspiracy, even though she can't explain what it's covering up. The author is concerned about her gullibility because she knows almost nothing about the state. He then takes action by researching and confronting her, leading to her eventually conceding. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, the key points here are the girlfriend's belief and the author's response. The girlfriend's belief seems to be a conspiracy theory without any real evidence. The author is trying to correct her by providing factual information. Now, the issue is whether his approach was wrong. \n\nConspiracy theories can be tricky. People might hold them for various reasons, sometimes due to misinformation or lack of knowledge. The author's approach was to fact-check and present evidence. That seems reasonable. However, the way he did it\u2014making her promise she doesn't believe ND doesn't exist\u2014could be seen as overstepping. Maybe he should have been more understanding first, but given that she was questioning the state's existence, which is a basic geographical fact, his response might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's belief is clearly incorrect. The author is trying to educate her, which is a good thing. But if he was condescending or made her feel bad about her belief, that could be an issue. However, the story doesn't mention him being rude; he just provided facts and asked for a promise. The girlfriend ended up caving, so maybe he succeeded. \n\nIs there a line between being firm and being an asshole? The author's concern is about her gullibility, which is valid if she's susceptible to believing wild theories. The method of addressing it might be a bit forceful, but the intent is good. In relationships, respecting each other's beliefs is important, but when a belief is factually baseless, correcting it isn't wrong. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are based on wanting to ensure his partner isn't believing in a conspiracy without evidence. The answer should be B.\n"
