My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their girlfriend believe that North Dakota exists after she thought it might not. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend heard something about North Dakota being a conspiracy. She couldn't provide any evidence or specifics, just that she read something. The author then fact-checked, looked up info, and made her promise she doesn't really think it doesn't exist. Now the question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the girlfriend is being gullible here. She's believing a conspiracy without any real evidence. The author is trying to correct that by providing facts. But the user is asking if the author is wrong for doing so. \n\nWell, if the girlfriend is being gullible, the author isn't wrong for wanting to correct her. However, the way he approached it might be an issue. He made her promise she doesn't believe it, which could be seen as controlling or dismissive. Maybe he should have discussed it more calmly instead of demanding a promise. \n\nBut the main point is that the author is concerned about his partner's gullibility. Is it his place to correct her? I think it's reasonable to express concern if someone you care about is believing in something clearly false. But the method might matter. The girlfriend might feel disrespected if he's using a confrontational approach. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If his actions were to ensure she doesn't believe in a conspiracy without evidence, then he's not wrong. On the other hand, if he's being overbearing, that's a different story. The situation says she finally caved, but he's not sure if she's convinced. Maybe he should have been more patient or understanding. \n\nBut in terms of the main issue: believing a state exists is a factual matter. The author isn't the asshole for insisting on facts. So the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for correcting her belief based on facts.\n"
