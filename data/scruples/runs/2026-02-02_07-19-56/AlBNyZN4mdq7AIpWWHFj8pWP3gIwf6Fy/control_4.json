My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend thinking North Dakota might not exist, and the author making her promise to believe it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The girlfriend has some kind of belief that North Dakota is a conspiracy, even though it's a well-known and existing state. The author is upset that she's gullible and made her promise to believe in its existence. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for doing that? Well, the girlfriend's belief is clearly incorrect. North Dakota is a real state, so the author is right about that. But how they handled it might be the problem. Making her promise sounds a bit controlling. Maybe he was overreacting because he's frustrated with her gullibility. But on the other hand, she was spreading a conspiracy theory, which is problematic. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right approach. Forcing her to promise to believe in North Dakota's existence could be seen as authoritarian. Relationships should allow for open discussion without coercion. However, the author is justified in correcting a false belief. The problem might be the method he used rather than the intent. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's stance is based on no evidence, so the author is right to challenge that. But making her promise might be unnecessary. The author isn't wrong in wanting to correct misinformation, but the way he did it could be seen as harsh. However, the question is if he's the asshole. In the AITA context, people often consider both sides. The author's actions were to correct a false belief, which is reasonable, but the method might be where he's at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the author is right that North Dakota exists and is justified in correcting a conspiracy theory. However, the way he handled it could be improved. But in terms of being in the wrong, since the state actually exists and the girlfriend is wrong, the author isn't the asshole here. He's the one defending reality. So the answer is B.\n"
