My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and he insists she needs to believe it does. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know others' thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girlfriend's belief that North Dakota doesn't exist seems unfounded. It's a conspiracy theory, as she can't provide any concrete reasons. The author is concerned about her gullibility and tries to convince her using facts. He even makes her promise to believe in ND. The girlfriend is upset because he's being an asshole by forcing his beliefs on her.\n\nSo, the key points are: Is the author right to demand she accept North Dakota exists? Is it okay to use facts to correct a conspiracy belief, or is that being an asshole? \n\nConspiracy theories often stem from distrust in information, but in this case, ND is a real state with plenty of evidence. The author's approach might be seen as overreacting. He's using a confrontational method (googling facts and making her promise) which could be stressful. While the belief is irrational, the way he handles it might be the issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's right to hold her belief, albeit incorrect, is a matter of personal freedom. However, the author is not forcing her to change, just trying to reason. But the fact that he's making her promise and labeling her as gullible could be seen as dismissive of her perspective. Maybe he should have engaged in a more empathetic way. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's beliefs is important. Even if one is wrong, the approach to correction matters. The author's method might be the problem here. Instead of demanding belief, discussing why she thinks ND doesn't exist and addressing her concerns could be better. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for how he's handling the situation rather than the content. He's not wrong for wanting to correct a false belief, but his method of doing so is causing a conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the way he's enforcing his view without considering her feelings or reasons.\n"
