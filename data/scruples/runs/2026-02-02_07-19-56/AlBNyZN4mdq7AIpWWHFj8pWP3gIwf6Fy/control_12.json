My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and he made her promise she didn't believe it. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend's belief seems to be based on some vague conspiracy theory she read. She can't provide specifics, but she's questioning the existence of a real state. The author then Googles facts about North Dakota and demands a promise from her. She eventually gives in, but he's still unsure.\n\nNow, the author's main point is that he's concerned his girlfriend is too gullible. He thinks it's a problem if she can't accept that North Dakota exists, given it's on maps and all. He took it upon himself to correct her by researching and making her promise. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, maybe. Let's think about relationships. Dismissing someone's beliefs without understanding why they hold them can be an issue. The girlfriend's belief, even if based on a conspiracy theory, might stem from something deeper, like a lack of education, exposure to misinformation, or personal experiences. Instead of validating her feelings or exploring why she thinks that, the author took a confrontational approach by researching and making her promise. That could be seen as dismissive or not respecting her perspective.\n\nAdditionally, forcing someone to acknowledge something without addressing the root of their doubt might not be effective. The fact that she caved but he's still not convinced shows that the issue wasn't really resolved. Maybe he should have been more patient, asked why she thought that, and provided support instead of just facts. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is right that North Dakota exists. But the way he handled it could be problematic. Relationships require empathy and understanding. If he's being judgmental about her belief, that's not healthy. The girlfriend might feel attacked, leading to more issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's approach was confrontational and possibly disrespectful. He should have handled it with more empathy, trying to understand her perspective before correcting her. Therefore, he might be the asshole here.\n"
