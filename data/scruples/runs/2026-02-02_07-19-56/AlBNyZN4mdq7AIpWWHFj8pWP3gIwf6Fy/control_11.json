My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for making their girlfriend believe North Dakota exists. The situation is that the girlfriend started doubting North Dakota's existence, and the author tried to convince her using facts and even made her promise she didn't believe it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's concern is that their partner is gullible, which could be a red flag for them. They tried to address it by providing evidence. On the other hand, the girlfriend's initial skepticism might stem from some conspiracy theory she encountered. But the author's reaction seems to be about correcting a factual misunderstanding.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author overstepped. The author did some research, presented facts, and asked for a promise. That's reasonable in a relationship where trust in each other's beliefs is important. However, making someone promise not to believe something could be seen as controlling if taken too far. But in this case, it's a factual issue. The author isn't restricting freedom of thought but ensuring their partner isn't misled by unfounded claims.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's inability to name anything about North Dakota suggests she's not well-informed, which the author points out. The author's actions are about correcting misinformation, not being dismissive. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate concern without being oppressive. Answer B.\n"
