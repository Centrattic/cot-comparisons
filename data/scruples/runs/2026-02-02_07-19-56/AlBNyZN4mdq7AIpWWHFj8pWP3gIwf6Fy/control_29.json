My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole for making their girlfriend believe North Dakota exists.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's claim that North Dakota might not exist seems unfounded. The author points out that North Dakota is on every map and she can't name anything from there, which suggests her belief is based on a conspiracy theory. The author's reaction is to fact-check with Google and demand a promise that she doesn't actually believe it. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. The author is concerned about their partner's gullibility, which is valid to a point, but insisting she promise to believe in North Dakota's existence might be controlling. It's possible the author is dismissing her views without understanding why she holds them. Maybe she was influenced by something she saw online, and instead of just correcting the facts, the author made it about a promise, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's stance is illogical. If someone doesn't believe a country exists, there's a problem. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it might be the issue. Insisting on a promise could be seen as pressuring her into a position without addressing her underlying reasons. So the author might be in the wrong for how they reacted, even if the content of their message is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the one spreading the conspiracy; they're trying to correct a false belief. However, the method\u2014making her promise\u2014could be seen as authoritarian. The answer hinges on the approach rather than the content. The correct answer is A, the author is the asshole because they forced a promise instead of having a more constructive conversation.\n"
