My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and he made her promise to believe it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend mentioned North Dakota is a conspiracy. The author counters with facts, like it's on maps and has people/things there. He made her promise not to doubt it. Now, he's questioning if he's wrong for needing her to accept North Dakota exists.\n\nSo, the key points here. Is the author overreacting? Well, North Dakota is a real state. Believing it's a conspiracy is a bit extreme, but maybe the girlfriend is being playful or sarcastic. The author's approach was to force a promise, which might be controlling. Relationships require tolerance for different viewpoints, even if they're incorrect. Making someone swear to believe a fact they don't agree with could be seen as authoritarian. The girlfriend might feel disrespected if he's not allowing her to have her own opinion, even if it's wrong. Also, the author's need to have her accept North Dakota's existence could be more about his own discomfort with her gullibility rather than the belief itself. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's being too rigid and not respecting her perspective, even if it's clearly incorrect. The answer might be A (Yes).\n"
