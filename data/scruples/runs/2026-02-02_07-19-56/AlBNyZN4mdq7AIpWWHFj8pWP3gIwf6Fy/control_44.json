My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for needing their girlfriend to believe North Dakota exists. The situation is that the girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, maybe from some conspiracy she read. The author then googles facts about the state and insists she promise not to believe it's fake.\n\nHmm, first, does the author have a right to be concerned about their partner's belief in a conspiracy? Well, maybe if it's affecting trust or reality in their relationship. But North Dakota's existence is a basic fact. The girlfriend is being gullible here. The author tried to correct her with facts, which seems reasonable. But forcing someone to make a promise about it might be overstepping. However, the girlfriend might see that as controlling. \n\nWait, the author says they needed her to promise she doesn't believe it. That could be seen as pressuring her to accept their view, which might not be healthy. But on the other hand, believing in conspiracy theories can be a red flag in a relationship. The author is worried about her gullibility, which might be valid. The key is whether the approach was right. Arguing with facts is okay, but making her promise could be crossing a line. So the author might be the asshole if they insisted too much on her conforming to their view rather than respecting her freedom of thought, even if it's based on misinformation. But maybe the girlfriend's belief is just a joke or a temporary thing. The author's reaction might be disproportionate. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is concerned about her being too easily influenced by conspiracy theories, it's a legitimate concern. But how they handled it could be the problem. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship and how serious the girlfriend's belief was. Without more info, it's hard, but generally, insisting on a promise might not be the best approach. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they forced a commitment instead of having a calm discussion. But if the girlfriend is in denial about a basic fact, maybe not. I think the line here is between correcting misinformation and being controlling. The author's action of needing a promise might be where they're wrong. So answer A.\n"
