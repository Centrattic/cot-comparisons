My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author's girlfriend doubting the existence of North Dakota and the author responding by Googling facts and making her promise she doesn't believe it's not real.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The girlfriend claims North Dakota might not exist, which is obviously false since it's a real U.S. state. The author then tries to correct her by providing facts and insisting she admits she's wrong. The question is whether the author is the asshole for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is correcting a false belief held by their girlfriend. The girlfriend's belief is based on conspiracy theories and lack of knowledge. The author's approach was to fact-check and require a promise, which might have come off as confrontational or controlling.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If the author is trying to educate and correct a factual inaccuracy, that's generally a good thing. However, the way they approached it\u2014using Google facts and making her promise\u2014might be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being challenged. But the author's concern about gullibility is valid. However, the method could be more respectful.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to handle such situations with empathy. The author might not be wrong in wanting to correct misinformation, but the method could be improved. However, the situation is a bit trivial (questioning a real state's existence), so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a factual standpoint, the author is right to correct a false belief. The problem might be in the approach. However, the girlfriend's initial stance is so off-base that the author's reaction, while maybe a bit intense, isn't entirely unreasonable. The key is whether making her promise was necessary. That might be where the author could be seen as overreaching, but given the absurdity of the claim, it's a minor issue.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), because the author is correcting a factual error, though the method could be better. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's intent was to address a conspiracy belief, it's not the author's fault for wanting to correct it. The girlfriend's gullibility is her own issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
