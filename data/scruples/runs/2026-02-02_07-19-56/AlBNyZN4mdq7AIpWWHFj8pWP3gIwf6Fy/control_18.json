My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their girlfriend believe North Dakota exists.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, maybe because she read something about a conspiracy. The author then goes online to find facts and insists she promise to believe it exists. She eventually gives in, but he's still unsure if she really does.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's reasoning is that it's a problem if his girlfriend is gullible enough to believe such a conspiracy. He tried to correct her by providing facts and made her promise to accept it. She caved, but maybe not fully convinced.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, people can have different views, but this seems like a harmless disagreement. The author isn't harming her; he's trying to correct a misconception. However, making someone promise to believe something might be overstepping. But the question is whether he's the asshole. The girlfriend's belief is based on a conspiracy theory with no evidence, which is illogical. The author's response is to educate her, which is reasonable. Insisting she acknowledge the facts isn't unreasonable. But is making her promise a bit controlling? Maybe, but the situation is a bit trivial. The main issue is her gullibility, not the author's response. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
