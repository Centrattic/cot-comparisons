My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author then Googles facts about ND and insists the girlfriend promises she doesn't actually believe it doesn't exist.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were unreasonable. The key points here are the girlfriend's belief and the author's response. The girlfriend seems to have a conspiracy theory about ND not existing but can't explain it. The author's reaction is to demand a promise that she doesn't believe it, which might be seen as controlling or overreacting.\n\nWait, but is the author's concern valid? If someone's partner is gullible or believes in conspiracy theories, could that be a red flag? The author might be worried about her critical thinking skills. However, the way he enforced this by making her promise might be too much. Arguing over a state's existence seems trivial, but the underlying issue is trust in her judgment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might be seen as dismissive. Instead of discussing why she thinks that, he just insists on a promise. That could come off as authoritarian. Also, the fact that he had to Google facts to convince her shows that her belief is unfounded. But demanding a promise might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, AITA? The author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with patience. He should have tried to understand her reasoning first or engage in a more constructive dialogue. Making her promise isn't a healthy way to resolve the issue. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
