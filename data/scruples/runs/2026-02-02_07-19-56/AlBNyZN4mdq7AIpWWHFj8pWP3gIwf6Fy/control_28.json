My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author tried to correct her by looking up facts and made her promise she doesn't believe it. The girlfriend thinks the author is an asshole for this, but the author isn't sure if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The key points here are about belief systems and how one person handles another's beliefs. The girlfriend has a conspiracy theory about North Dakota, which is a real state. The author's response was to fact-check and confront her about it. \n\nIs it wrong for the author to want his partner to accept reality? Well, North Dakota is a real place with a known existence. If someone is in denial about that, it's a form of conspiracy thinking. The author's approach was to use facts and evidence to correct her. That's reasonable in terms of correcting misinformation. However, the way he did it\u2014making her promise she doesn't believe it\u2014might come off as aggressive or controlling, depending on how it was communicated. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is challenging someone's belief, even if that belief is false. In relationships, it's important to respect each other's views unless they're harmful. However, believing a state doesn't exist is a form of delusion or misinformation. Correcting that with facts isn't inherently wrong. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting his partner to accept factual reality. The problem might be if he's being confrontational, but the situation doesn't indicate he was abusive. He used Google to find facts and tried to reason with her. The girlfriend's argument is that he's an asshole for requiring her to accept North Dakota's existence, but that's a real place. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's correcting a factual error, which is reasonable. However, it's a bit of a light situation, and maybe the girlfriend's belief is a red flag for gullibility, but the author's actions are justified.\n"
