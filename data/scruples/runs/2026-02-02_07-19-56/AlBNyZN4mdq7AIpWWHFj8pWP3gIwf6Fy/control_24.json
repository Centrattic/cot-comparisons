My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) story is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist. The author tried to convince her otherwise by Googling facts and making her promise she doesn't believe it's fake. The girlfriend thinks the author is the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota's existence.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were reasonable. The girlfriend's belief that North Dakota might not exist is, in reality, a conspiracy theory. North Dakota is a well-known state, clearly shown on maps, with cities like Bismarck and Fargo, and institutions like the University of North Dakota. The girlfriend's stance seems to be based on gullibility or perhaps misunderstanding some online conspiracy content.\n\nThe author's response was to fact-check and insist that she acknowledge the state's existence. The girlfriend might perceive this as overreacting because the author took time to Google facts and insisted on a promise. However, the author's concern might stem from a genuine worry about his partner's critical thinking skills. It's possible the author wants to ensure she's not being influenced by unreliable sources.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key here is whether his response was reasonable. Arguing that a U.S. state doesn't exist is a fringe belief. The author's actions\u2014using facts and trying to correct a factual misunderstanding\u2014seem justified. However, the insistence on a promise and labeling her as gullible might come off as condescending. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being questioned, hence why she thinks he's the asshole.\n\nBut considering the context, the author isn't wrong for wanting to address a potentially harmful belief. However, the method might be questionable. Instead of making her promise, maybe a more empathetic approach would be better. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's stance is on the side of factual accuracy. The girlfriend's belief is the issue here, not the author's effort to correct it.\n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to correct a conspiracy belief, which is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction might be overreacting to the correction method, but the core issue is her belief, not the author's attempt to address it.\n"
