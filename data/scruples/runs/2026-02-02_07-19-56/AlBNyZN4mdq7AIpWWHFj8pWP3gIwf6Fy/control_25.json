My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong for making his girlfriend promise she doesn't believe North Dakota doesn't exist.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's stance: she claims North Dakota might be a conspiracy and can't explain what it's covering up. She also can't name anything from the state but insists there's reasonable doubt. That sounds like a conspiracy theory or maybe she's joking, but she's taking it seriously.\n\nThe boyfriend's response: He Googled facts about North Dakota and asked her to promise she doesn't believe it's not real. He tried to convince her, and she eventually gave in. Now he's worried he's the asshole for needing her to believe it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The issue is whether the boyfriend overstepped. He's trying to correct a belief that seems unfounded. If North Dakota is a real state, then his concern is understandable. But how he approached it might matter. Making someone promise something because of a belief, even if it's based on conspiracy thinking, could be seen as controlling. Especially if the girlfriend isn't being harmful, just expressing a strange belief.\n\nBut maybe she was testing him or was joking? The story says she caved, so maybe it was a game. If she was being serious, then the boyfriend is trying to correct misinformation, which is a common issue. However, the way he enforced it by demanding a promise could be problematic. Relationships require respect for each other's beliefs, even when they're incorrect. Forcing someone to agree might not be the right approach.\n\nOn the other hand, if she genuinely believed something that's factually incorrect, there's a line where one partner might want the other to accept reality. But insisting on a promise to believe something can be seen as authoritarian. The boyfriend's reaction might be excessive if the belief isn't causing real harm. The girlfriend's stance is based on gullibility, but the boyfriend's demand for a promise could be seen as overreacting, even if he's right about North Dakota existing.\n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the question is whether the boyfriend overreacted. The answer would likely be B (No), because he's trying to correct a factual error, even if his method was a bit forceful. However, maybe the answer depends on context not given here. If the girlfriend's belief was a joke and he took it too seriously, then maybe A. But based on the info, the boyfriend isn't the asshole; he's addressing a factual issue. The problem is her belief, not his attempt to correct it, though the method could use improvement. So the answer is B.\n"
