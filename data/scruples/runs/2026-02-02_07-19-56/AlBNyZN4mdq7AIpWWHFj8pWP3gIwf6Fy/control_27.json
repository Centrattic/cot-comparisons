My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist, and he made her promise to believe it exists. The user wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend seems to have a conspiracy theory about North Dakota, which isn't true. The author is trying to correct her by providing facts, like North Dakota being on maps and having real places and people. He even lists things from North Dakota to prove its existence, like the Dakotaverse or maybe specific cities.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author overstepped. He made her promise not to believe ND doesn't exist. That sounds a bit controlling or maybe not respecting her perspective. But on the other hand, he's trying to correct a factual error. The girlfriend's belief is based on no real evidence; she can't explain what it's covering up. The author is concerned about her gullibility, which might be valid, but his approach was to force a promise.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's views without being dismissive. Maybe instead of making her promise, he could have used a more respectful approach to discuss why she thinks that. Making someone promise could come off as authoritarian. But the girlfriend's stance is also unrealistic. The author is acting out of concern for her critical thinking, but the method might be wrong.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. If he made her promise, that's a problem. But if he just corrected her facts without forcing a promise, it's okay. The story says he made her promise, which could be the issue. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he forced her to promise, rather than discussing it respectfully. However, the girlfriend's belief is irrational, so the author's concern is valid, but the approach was flawed. So maybe A is correct.\n"
