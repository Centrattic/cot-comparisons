My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for requiring his girlfriend to believe that North Dakota exists.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author's girlfriend mentioned that she read something suggesting North Dakota is a conspiracy. She can't provide details, but she's doubting its existence. The author then Googles facts about North Dakota and insists that she promise she doesn't really think it's not real. The girlfriend thinks he's an asshole because of this, but the author is questioning if he's the one at fault.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the girlfriend's belief in a conspiracy about a real state. The author's reaction is to confront her and demand she accept North Dakota's existence. Is that reasonable?\n\nWell, North Dakota is a well-documented, real state in the US. The girlfriend's doubt seems unfounded. The author's actions are based on correcting a false belief. However, the way he approached it\u2014requiring a promise\u2014might come off as overbearing. But given the context, is he wrong to want her to accept factual reality?\n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable to correct misinformation. On the other, demanding a promise could be seen as controlling. But in this case, the girlfriend's belief is based on no evidence, and the author is trying to address a concerning level of gullibility. The line between helping and being overbearing might be thin here. \n\nThe key point is whether the author was wrong in insisting she accept North Dakota's existence. Since North Dakota is a real place with public information, the author isn't wrong to correct a false belief. However, the method might be questionable. But the main issue is the content of the belief, not the method. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's correcting a baseless conspiracy theory.\n"
