My girlfriend thinks North Dakota might not exist\nAlright, so at some point tonight North Dakota was mentioned. It might have been on Facebook, TV, maybe someone mentioned it, I honestly can\u2019t remember. However, my girlfriend announces that she read something about how North Dakota was a conspiracy, and how it was just a big cover up for something. She couldn\u2019t answer what it was covering up exactly or how North Dakota is clearly on every map in modern print. She claims that I couldn\u2019t name anyone, place, or thing from North Dakota which was simply not true. \n\nFor whatever reason, she thinks there\u2019s a reasonable doubt that North Dakota doesn\u2019t exist, simply because she knows almost nothing about it. Now here\u2019s where you find out if I\u2019m the asshole or not. For me personally, it\u2019s an issue if my significant other is gullible enough to believe North Dakota might not exist. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I googled facts about North Dakota and told her that I needed her to promise me that she didn\u2019t actually believe North Dakota could possibly be not real. After a few minutes of trying to get her to believe in North Dakota (I cant believe I\u2019d ever be in this situation) she finally caved. I\u2019m not totally convinced though. \n\nAm I the asshole for needing her to believe in North Dakota?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend questioning the existence of North Dakota, and him reacting by Googling facts and demanding a promise that she doesn't actually believe it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend's belief that North Dakota might not exist seems to stem from some conspiracy theory or lack of knowledge. The author's response\u2014using Google facts and making her promise not to believe it\u2014could be seen as dismissive or condescending. Even though the author is trying to correct a false belief, the method might be the issue. Insisting on a promise and labeling her as gullible could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't being aggressive or abusive; he's addressing a belief that's based on misinformation. But in relationships, how we handle each other's beliefs matters. Forcing someone to conform to your view, even if you're right, can create tension. The key might be that the author is more concerned about her gullibility than the actual belief, and his approach was to assert his knowledge rather than engage in a respectful discussion.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. If he's making her feel bad for having a quirky belief, that's a problem. But if he's concerned about her critical thinking, maybe there's a different angle. However, the way he handled it\u2014demanding a promise\u2014comes off as authoritarian. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the approach taken, even if the concern is valid.\n"
