      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent who's upset because their ex-wife wants their children to use their own savings to buy furniture for the ex's house, even though the parent pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's expenses, so if the ex is receiving that money but still expecting the kids to use their personal savings for furniture, it might seem conflicting. However, the children's savings are their own, right? If they earned that money through allowance or other means, the parent might have a right to let the kids decide how to use it.\n\nBut wait, the parent is angry because the ex isn't covering the essentials with the child support. If the child support is supposed to cover basic needs, then the ex might be misusing that money by not buying furniture, which is an essential item. The parent might feel that their child support is being used improperly, hence the frustration.\n\nAnother angle: the parent is allowing the kids to have savings and use them as they wish. If the kids want to buy a desk at their mom's house, maybe the parent is being reasonable by considering letting them do so. But the parent is upset because the ex isn't contributing what she should, leading to the kids' savings being used instead.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong for being angry? Well, the parent is the one paying child support, so expecting that money to cover everything might be reasonable. If the ex isn't using the child support to buy necessary items, then the parent's frustration is justified. However, the children's savings are separate. The parent might be right to be upset that the ex isn't covering the costs she's supposed to with the child support, and that the kids are now expected to use their own money for things that should be covered by the support.\n\nOn the other hand, if the kids saved their own money, they might have a right to spend it as they see fit, even on furniture at their mom's house. The parent might be overstepping by not allowing the kid to use their savings, especially if the ex isn't providing the necessary funds. But the parent's anger might stem from a justifiable place where the ex isn't fulfilling her responsibilities.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It depends on whether the child support is being used properly. If the ex isn't using the support to cover essentials like furniture, maybe the parent should address that with her instead of being upset with the kids. The parent might not be in the wrong for being angry about the ex's actions, but if they prevent the kids from using their own money, that could be an issue. The key is whether the parent is allowing the kids to use their savings or not. The parent hasn't decided yet, but their anger seems directed at the ex's actions rather than the kids. So maybe the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
