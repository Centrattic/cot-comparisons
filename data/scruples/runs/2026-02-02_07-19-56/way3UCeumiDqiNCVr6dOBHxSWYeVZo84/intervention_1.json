      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has two kids, and has 50% custody. He pays $2,000 in child support monthly. His son wants to use his saved money from the author's house to buy a desk for his room at his ex-wife's house. The author is upset because the ex is getting child support but still expects the kids to use their own money for furniture at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and emotional aspects here. Child support is supposed to cover the children's needs, including furniture. If the ex is receiving child support, she should be responsible for purchasing necessary items like furniture. The kids have savings from the author's house, but the author is upset that the ex isn't using the child support for that. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that his money isn't being used properly. However, the child support is meant to cover the children's expenses regardless of who holds the money. The kids have their own savings, but the author is conflicted about letting the son use it for the ex's house. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the ex is using child support to avoid covering furniture costs, that's an issue. But the author is also a custodial parent (though shared custody), and the furniture is for the ex's household. The author might feel that the ex isn't fulfilling her responsibility since the desk is for her house. \n\nHowever, the author is not obligated to provide furniture for the ex's house. The child support is supposed to cover that. If the ex isn't using the child support for essentials, that's a problem. But the author is getting upset that the kids have to use their own savings. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author might not be in the wrong because the ex should cover furniture with the child support. But the author might be overstepping if he's controlling the kids' savings. If the savings are the kids', they might have the right to use them. The author's frustration could be valid, but maybe he's not the asshole for being upset. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the ex should be responsible for furniture in her house with the child support, and it's reasonable for the author to be upset if she's not using it properly. The author isn't obligated to pay for furniture at the ex's house beyond child support.\n"
