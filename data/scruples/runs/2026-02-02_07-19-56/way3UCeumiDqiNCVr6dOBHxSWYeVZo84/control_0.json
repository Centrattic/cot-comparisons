      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The situation is about a divorced parent who is upset that their ex-wife is making the kids use their saved money to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though the author is paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has 50% custody and pays $2000 in child support. The kids have savings from the author's house. The son wants to use that savings to buy a desk for his room at the mother's house. The author is upset because they think the ex is taking the child support but still making the kids use their own money for essentials at her house.\n\nNow, considering child support laws, typically child support is intended to cover the child's needs, including things like furniture. If the ex is receiving child support, she should be responsible for providing necessary items like a desk. However, the author might feel that since they are paying child support, the ex should cover these expenses without using the kids' personal savings. \n\nThe author's anger could stem from feeling that the ex is not using the child support properly. However, the kids have their own savings, which they might want to use for personal purchases, like a desk. The author might be concerned that the ex is not fulfilling her responsibility to provide essentials. On the other hand, the kids might be choosing to use their own money for a personal item, which the ex isn't forcing them to do, but the author is upset about the ex's role in this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is meant to cover the child's needs, so the ex should be responsible for the desk. If the ex isn't using the child support for that, there might be a case to question that. But the author is paying the support, so maybe the ex is supposed to handle those expenses. The kids' savings are their own, so using them for a personal item isn't necessarily wrong, but the author might feel it's unfair given the existing child support.\n\nEmotionally, the author's frustration is valid because it seems like the ex isn't handling the child support as intended, which is supposed to cover such costs. However, the author could also be overstepping by not allowing the kids to use their own money if it's their choice. The key is whether the ex is misusing the child support by not covering essentials and expecting the kids to use personal funds instead.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is justified in being upset if the ex isn't using the child support for necessary items. However, if the kids want to use their savings for a personal purchase, the author might be being too controlling. The answer depends on whether the ex is violating the child support agreement. If the ex isn't, then the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the kids to use their own money. But if the ex is misusing the support, then the author's anger is valid. Since the situation is a bit ambiguous, but the author is within their rights to be upset about potential misuse of child support, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
