      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody, and pays $2000 in child support. The kids want to use their saved money from the author's house to buy furniture for their mom's house. The author is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically intended to cover the child's needs, including furniture. If the ex is receiving child support, she's supposed to use it for the kids' expenses. However, if the kids are using their own savings, maybe the ex isn't contributing enough from the child support. But the author is upset because the kids have to use their savings for their mom's house, even though the author pays support.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author might feel it's unfair. They're paying for support but the ex expects the kids to spend their own money on furniture. However, the kids' savings are their own money, so maybe the author shouldn't be angry about them spending it. But the author might feel that the ex isn't using the child support properly.\n\nAnother angle: the kids have essentials at the author's house, so maybe the ex isn't providing the same. If the child support is supposed to cover furniture, then the ex should be using that money instead of making the kids spend their savings. The author is angry that the ex isn't covering the costs through support and instead is making the kids use their own money.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: The kids' savings are their own, and they can choose to spend them. The author shouldn't control how their child spends their money. But if the ex isn't using the child support for essentials, maybe the author should address that with the ex instead of being upset about the kids spending their own money.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the child support is supposed to cover the furniture, the ex is at fault for not using it. The author's anger might be misplaced if the ex isn't fulfilling her part. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, as the ex is not covering the expenses she should be. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
