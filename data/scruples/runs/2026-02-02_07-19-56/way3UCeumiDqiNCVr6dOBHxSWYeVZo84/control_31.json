      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their ex-wife making the kids buy their own furniture for their room at her house, even though the author is paying child support. The author is upset because they feel like their ex is using the child support and also making the kids use their savings from the author's home to buy essentials.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has 50% custody and pays $2,000 monthly in child support. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk at the ex's house. The author is frustrated because they're already paying child support, so they believe the ex shouldn't also be making the kids spend their saved money from the author's home on necessities at her house.\n\nThe key points here are about the responsibilities of each parent post-divorce. Child support is meant to cover the child's needs, so if the ex is receiving that and still expecting the kids to use their savings from the other parent's home for essentials, that could be a problem. The author might be right to feel that the child support should cover such expenses. However, the kids have their own savings, so maybe the ex isn't wrong in encouraging them to use their money if they want to buy something extra. But the desk is an essential item, not just a luxury. If the child support is supposed to cover essentials, then the ex shouldn't be making the kids use their savings for that. Also, the fact that the kids have essentials at the author's house but need to buy them again at the ex's house might be a bit unfair since they're split between two homes. The author's frustration seems valid because they are already covering the costs through child support. The ex might be expecting the kids to manage their own money for things that the child support should already cover. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B (No).\n"
