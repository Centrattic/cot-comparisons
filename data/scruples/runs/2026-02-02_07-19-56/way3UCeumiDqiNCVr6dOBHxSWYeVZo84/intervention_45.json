      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their ex-wife making their kids buy their own furniture with their saved money for the ex's house, even though the author is paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author is paying $2000/month in child support and has 50% custody. Child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, so if the ex is making the kids use their own savings for furniture, that might be a problem. But the law varies by location, and it's not specified here. However, generally, child support should cover essentials like furniture. So maybe the ex is not covering what they should, which could make her the asshole instead.\n\nThen there's the emotional angle. The author is angry because they feel the ex is not using the child support properly. The kids have furniture at the author's house but need to buy their own at the ex's. That seems inconsistent. The author might be right to be upset if the child support is supposed to cover those items. But the author is also considering whether the kids should buy their own furniture, which could be seen as not supporting the kids' needs.\n\nThe kids' savings are their own money, but if they're using it for furniture, maybe the ex isn't providing a proper environment. The author's reaction is frustration over the ex's behavior. The key point is whether the child support is meant to cover furniture. If the ex is supposed to use the child support for that, then she's not doing her part, and the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. \n\nHowever, the author is also considering allowing the kid to use savings. If the kid has their own savings, maybe it's okay for them to use it, as long as it's their choice. But the author is angry because the ex isn't covering the essentials. So the author isn't wrong for being upset about the ex's behavior. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't the asshole because the ex isn't using the child support as intended. The author's anger is justified if the child support is supposed to cover furniture. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
