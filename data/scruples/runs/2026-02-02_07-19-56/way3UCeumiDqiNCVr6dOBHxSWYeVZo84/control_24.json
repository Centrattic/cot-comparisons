      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario. The author is divorced, has 50% custody of two kids, and pays $2000 in child support. The ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings for furniture at her house. The son wants to take his savings from the author's house to buy a desk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, right? So if the ex is already receiving a significant amount, expecting the kids to use their personal savings for furniture could be seen as shifting some financial responsibility back to the kids, which isn't fair. The author is frustrated because the ex is taking money from him but still making the kids use their own funds for things at her house. \n\nBut wait, the kids have their own savings. The author might be upset because he's already paying for their upkeep through child support. If the ex is asking the kids to use their own money for furniture, which is an extra expense, that could be seen as unreasonable. The author isn't necessarily withholding; he's upset about the ex's actions. \n\nHowever, the author hasn't decided whether to let the son use the savings. Maybe he's conflicted. The key here is whether the ex's actions are appropriate. Child support should cover essentials. If the kids are expected to pay for furniture out of their own money, that might not be the ex's responsibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's paying child support, which should cover the kids' needs. The ex is making them use their savings for non-essentials. The author's anger is about the ex's behavior, not his own. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author isn't the asshole. The ex might be in the wrong here by not using the child support for the kids' needs and instead expecting them to use personal funds.\n"
