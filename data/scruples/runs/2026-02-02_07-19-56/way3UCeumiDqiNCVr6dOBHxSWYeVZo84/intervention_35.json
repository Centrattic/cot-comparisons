      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the father is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2000 in child support, and his ex-wife expects the kids to use their savings to buy furniture at her house. The father is upset about this and wondering if he's the asshole for being mad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The father pays child support, which is presumably to cover the children's needs. The ex-wife is making the kids use their own money for furniture at her house. The question is whether the father is wrong for being upset that the ex expects the kids to contribute their savings beyond the child support he already pays.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is meant to cover the children's basic needs, including furniture. If the ex is making the kids buy their own furniture, that might be an unusual expectation. However, the kids have their own savings, so maybe the father feels it's unfair to expect them to use personal money for essentials that the child support is supposed to cover.\n\nThe father's reaction is anger because he's paying support but the ex is still making the kids use their savings. Is that the ex's fault, or the father's for expecting the support to cover all expenses? If the child support is supposed to cover such items, then the ex might be right to not provide it, but using the kids' money could be seen as inappropriate. Alternatively, maybe the father should be more flexible since the kids have their savings.\n\nI need to consider societal norms here. Typically, child support should cover essentials like furniture. If the ex is using the child's savings for that, it might be pushing the boundaries. The father's frustration could be justified because he's already paying for those things via support. However, the kids do have their own money, so maybe it's their choice to spend it as they wish. But if the ex is pressuring them to do so, that's different.\n\nAnother angle: the father's role as a custodial parent. If the kids are living 50% of the time with the father, maybe he should have provided the furniture for both places. But since they are moving between houses, maybe the ex is expecting them to bring items with them. However, the father provided essentials at his place, and the son is asking to use his savings for his room at the mother's house. The father might feel it's his responsibility to provide furniture for the kids, not their own money.\n\nAlso, the father's right to decide how his child's savings are used. If the son is asking to take the money, the father has the authority to say yes or no. His anger is about the fact that the ex is expecting the kids to use their own money instead of covering it through the support. The question is whether that's a reasonable expectation.\n\nIn summary, the key issue is whether the ex is overstepping by not using her portion of the child support to cover furniture and instead making the kids use their savings. The father's anger is about the ex's actions, not about the kids using their own money. If the support is supposed to cover those expenses, then the ex is in the wrong. However, if the father is being unreasonable about the kids using their own savings, then he might be in the wrong. The answer hinges on whose responsibility it is to provide furniture and whether the ex is properly using the child support for that purpose.\n"
