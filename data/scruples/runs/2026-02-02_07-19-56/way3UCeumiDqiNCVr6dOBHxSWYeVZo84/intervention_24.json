      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is divorced, has 50% custody, and pays $2,000 a month in child support. Their kids, 10 and 9 years old, are at their ex's house. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk at his mother's home. The author is upset that the ex is getting child support but still expects the kids to use their own money for furniture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and financial aspects. Child support is meant to cover the child's needs, right? So if the ex is receiving child support, wouldn't that include funds for things like furniture? The author might feel they're already covering the costs through support, so it's unfair for the ex to make the kids use their own savings. But then again, maybe the ex isn't required to use the child support for specific items, so expecting the kids to buy their own furniture might be unreasonable.\n\nFrom the kids' perspective, they might feel entitled to use their own money for things they need, especially if they have savings from gifts or allowance. But the author is upset because it's the ex's house, and maybe the author feels the ex should be responsible for that part of the kids' needs. However, since custody is shared, both parents might be expected to handle expenses in their respective households. \n\nAlso, the kids' savings could be their own money. If the son earned or was given that money, the author might not have control over how he uses it. The author's anger could stem from feeling that the ex isn't contributing enough, but it's not clear if the child support covers all necessary expenses. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author is right to be upset because the child support is supposed to cover those essentials, and the ex shouldn't expect the kids to use their own money for things that should be covered by support. But if the ex isn't using the child support for furniture, then maybe it's reasonable for the ex to expect the kids to use their own savings. However, that might not be the case, as the ex might be using the child support for other expenses like food, school, etc.\n\nI think the key here is whether the child support agreement includes provisions for furniture or not. If the ex is not required to provide furniture, then maybe they can ask the kids to buy their own, but that seems a bit harsh. Alternatively, the author might be right to be upset because it's an additional burden on the kids and not the parent's responsibility. \n\nBut since the author is sharing custody, maybe they should have discussed how expenses are split. If the ex is making the kids use their own money for furniture at her house, that could be seen as not using the child support appropriately. The author paying support expects that the ex is covering the necessary expenses. So the author's anger is justified because the ex isn't fulfilling that part, and instead, the kids are having to use their savings. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't in the wrong. The correct answer would be B, No.\n"
