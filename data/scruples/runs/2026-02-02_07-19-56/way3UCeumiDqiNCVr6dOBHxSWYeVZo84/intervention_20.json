      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2000 in child support, and is upset that his ex-wife is making their kids use their saved money to buy furniture for their room at her house. The kids have essentials at the author's house, but now the ex wants them to use their own savings for furniture at her place.\n\nSo, the author is angry because he's paying child support and now the ex is making the kids spend their own money on stuff at her house. He's wondering if he's the asshole for being upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is meant to cover the child's needs, so the ex should be using that money for essentials. If the furniture is considered an essential item, then the ex should be responsible for it from the child support. However, if the furniture is a luxury or optional, maybe the author's frustration is valid. \n\nBut the kids have their own savings. The author is okay with them using their money for furniture at his house, but not at the ex's. The ex isn't making the kids spend their savings; the kids are asking to use their own money. Maybe the author is being unreasonable because the kids' savings are their own to use as they wish. However, the ex might be pressuring them to use their savings instead of using the child support for furniture.\n\nThe author is upset because he's paying child support and now the ex is making the kids use their savings. But the child support is supposed to cover those expenses. If the ex is using the child support for other things and then making the kids buy furniture with their savings, that could be an issue. But if the ex is not using the child support for essentials and instead the kids are using their own money, maybe the ex is the one at fault here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is withholding allowing the kid to use their savings, which are the kid's own money. Maybe the author is overstepping by not letting them use their savings for their own needs. The author might be trying to control the kids' money beyond his custody time. If the kids have their savings at his house, he might be holding it as leverage against the ex.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the ex is using the child support for other things and the ex isn't using it for the kids' essentials, then maybe the ex is wrong. But if the author is preventing the kids from using their own money for their own needs, that might make him the asshole. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key point is that the kids' savings are their own. The author is upset because he's paying child support and now the ex is making the kids use their savings. However, the ex might be misusing the child support, but the author's reaction might be overstepping by controlling the kids' personal funds. So maybe the author is in the wrong by not allowing the kids to use their own money for their needs, even if the ex's actions are questionable. The author's frustration is valid, but his response might not be appropriate.\n"
