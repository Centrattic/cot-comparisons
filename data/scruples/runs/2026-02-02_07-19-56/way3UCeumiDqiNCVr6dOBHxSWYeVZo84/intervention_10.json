      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody of his kids, and pays around $2000 in child support. His son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk at his ex-wife's house. The author is upset because the ex-wife gets child support but still expects the kids to use their saved money for essentials at her place.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including things like furniture. So if the ex-wife is receiving child support, it's part of her responsibility to provide for the child's needs, including furniture. The fact that the kids have essentials at the author's house doesn't necessarily mean they should have to buy their own furniture at the other parent's house, especially since the child support is supposed to cover that. \n\nThe author is paying a significant amount in child support, so expecting the kids to use their own savings for furniture might be adding an extra financial burden on the kids. The author is upset because he's already contributing financially through support, so it's not fair for the ex to then require the kids to spend their own money on necessary items. \n\nHowever, the kids have their own savings from allowance or gifts, which they might want to use for personal purchases. But furniture is an essential item, so it might be the ex-wife's responsibility to provide that, not the kids' responsibility. The author's frustration is understandable because he's already paying for the child's needs via support. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife might be trying to teach the kids about budgeting or responsibility by letting them use their own money for things they want. But if the desk is an essential item, then it's part of the custodial parent's duty to provide it using the child support funds. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset that the ex is making the kids use their savings for something that should be covered by the child support. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The ex-wife should be covering the furniture costs with the child support, so the author's frustration is valid.\n"
