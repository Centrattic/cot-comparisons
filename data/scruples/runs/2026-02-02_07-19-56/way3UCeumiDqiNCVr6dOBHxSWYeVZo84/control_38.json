      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is divorced and has 50% custody. He pays $2,000 in child support. His son wants to use his saved money from the author's house to buy a desk at his mother's house. The author is upset that the ex-wife is getting child support but still expects the kids to use their savings for essentials there.\n\nFirst, child support is meant to cover the children's needs. If the ex-wife is receiving that money, she should be responsible for essentials like furniture. The son's savings are his own, but it's not fair for the ex to expect him to use personal savings for things that should be covered by her child support. The author is right to be upset because the ex isn't fulfilling her responsibility. The kids shouldn't have to dip into their savings for basics that the ex is paid to cover. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
