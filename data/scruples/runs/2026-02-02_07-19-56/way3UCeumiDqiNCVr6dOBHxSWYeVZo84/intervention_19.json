      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2000 in child support, and his ex-wife makes the kids use their saved money from his house to buy furniture for their room at her house. The author is upset about this and is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Child support is typically for the child's needs, so the ex-wife might be using the child support to cover basic expenses, including furniture. However, making the kids use their personal savings for items at her house could be seen as taking advantage of the child's savings, which they earned from pocket money.\n\nThe author's responsibility includes providing for the child's needs, which might include furniture. If the child's room at the mother's house is lacking essentials, maybe the ex isn't covering that part of child support. On the other hand, if the kids are using their own money for non-essential items, that's a different matter. The desk could be considered essential, so maybe the ex is shifting the financial burden to the kids instead of using her own money or the child support.\n\nBut the author is the one who allows the kids to keep their savings. If the kids have their own money, they might have the right to use it however they want, including buying furniture. However, the author might feel that since he's paying child support, the ex shouldn't require the kids to use their personal savings for items that should be covered by the child support.\n\nLegally, child support is supposed to help with the child's living expenses, so the ex might be within her rights to use the child support for such needs. However, making the kids use their own money could be seen as an unfair tactic. The author is upset because he feels the financial responsibility is being unfairly placed on him through both child support and the kids' savings.\n\nEthically, the ex might be trying to save money by not using the child support for all expenses, which could be seen as stingy or not fulfilling the intended purpose of child support. The author's anger might be justified if he considers that the child support is meant to cover such costs. However, the kids' savings are their own money, so if they want to spend it on furniture, that's their choice. The conflict arises because it's the ex's house, and maybe she's expecting the kids to contribute their savings to her household.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents are supposed to provide for the child's needs regardless of custody. If the kids need furniture at the mother's house, it's her responsibility to provide that, either from her own funds or the child support. Making the kids use their personal savings might be an unfair redistribution of resources.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's anger might be justified because the ex is using the child support and the kids' savings to cover her expenses. However, the kids' savings are their own, so if they choose to spend it, that's their right. The author might be in the right to be upset that the ex is making the kids use their money for her house's needs. Alternatively, the author might be overstepping by not allowing the kids to use their savings as they wish.\n\nI think the key points are whether the furniture is essential (which it is) and whether the ex should be using her own money or the child support for it. If the ex is using the child's savings instead, that's where the problem lies. So the author is not in the wrong for being upset because the ex isn't using the child support as intended, thus making the kids bear the cost. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
