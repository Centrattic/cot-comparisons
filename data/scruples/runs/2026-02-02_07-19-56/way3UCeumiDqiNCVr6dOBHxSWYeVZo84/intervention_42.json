      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the ex-wife is making the kids buy their own furniture for their room at her house, even though the author is paying child support. The kids have savings from the author's house, and they want to use that money to buy a desk. The author is angry about this because he's already paying child support and doesn't want the kids to use their savings for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including things like food, shelter, clothing, and education. Furniture could be considered part of that. However, the ex-wife is asking the kids to use their own savings, which might be money they've saved from allowances or gifts. The author is upset because he's contributing financially through child support but feels it's unfair that the ex is making the kids use their savings for additional expenses.\n\nNow, from a parenting perspective, it's important to think about the kids' well-being. If the kids have the savings, maybe it's about teaching them financial responsibility. However, if the furniture is a necessity and the ex isn't covering it with the child support, that could be a problem. The author might be right in feeling that the ex isn't fulfilling her part in providing for the children's needs, hence the frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, if the kids have the money saved up, using it for a desk might be a reasonable choice. The author could be overreacting by being angry about this. The question is whether it's the author's responsibility to cover all the kids' expenses, even after paying child support. The ex is allowed to make decisions regarding the children's upbringing, including how they manage their finances. So maybe the author is being the asshole by withholding the money when the kids want to use it for their own needs.\n\nWait, but the author is the one who has custody 50% of the time, so maybe the furniture at the ex's house is her responsibility. However, if the child support is supposed to cover all the costs, then the ex shouldn't be making the kids use their savings. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger might stem from the ex not using the child support properly, but the kids have their own savings. The author's role here is to support the kids, but maybe he's overstepping by not allowing them to use their own money. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) Is the ex using the child support correctly? 2) Are the kids' savings their own to use? If the child support is for the kids' needs, then the ex should cover the furniture without taking the kids' money. If the kids have their own savings, they can use it for personal items. The author might be right to be upset if the ex is not fulfilling her duty with the child support. However, if the kids want to use their own money, maybe it's their choice. The author is in a tough spot, but the ex might be the one at fault here for not covering necessary expenses. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the ex should cover those expenses with child support, and the author is justified in being upset about it.\n"
