      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent who's upset that their ex-wife makes the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house, even though he pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including furniture. If the ex is using the child support money to cover essentials and then expecting the kids to pay for additional items like a desk from their savings, that might be an issue. But I'm not a lawyer, so maybe there's a nuance here.\n\nEmotionally, the parent feels like they're being taken advantage of. He's providing financially but then the other parent expects the kids to contribute their own money for things that should be covered by the support. It's possible the ex isn't using the child support for all necessary expenses, which could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids have their own savings from pocket money. If they want to use that for a desk in their mom's house, maybe that's their choice. But if the ex is making them do it, that's different. The parent might be justified in feeling that the ex isn't fulfilling her part by providing essentials with the child support.\n\nI should also think about custody arrangements. Since it's 50-50, both parents are responsible for the kids' needs. If the ex is not providing the necessary furniture and instead making the kids use their own money, that's a problem. The desk is an essential item, so it should be covered by the support.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The ex might be misusing the child support by not covering necessary expenses, and expecting the kids to pay from their savings could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
