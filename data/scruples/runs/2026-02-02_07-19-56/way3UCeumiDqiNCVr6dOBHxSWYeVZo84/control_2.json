      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a divorced parent who has 50% custody and pays child support. The ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, which the author is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is paying child support, which presumably covers the children's basic needs. The ex-wife is asking the kids to use their saved money (from the author's house) to buy a desk at her place. The author is angry because they already cover child support and don't see why the kids should have to spend their own money on essentials at the other parent's home.\n\nChild support is typically meant to cover the children's expenses, so if the ex-wife is expecting the kids to use their own savings for necessary items, that might be an issue. The author is justified in feeling that the child support should cover such costs. However, the kids' savings are their own money, so maybe the author should let them use it. But the author is upset because the ex isn't contributing that part from the child support. \n\nIs the author wrong to be upset? Well, the child support is supposed to be the main funding for the kids' needs. If the ex is making the kids use their personal savings for things that should be covered by child support, that's a problem. The author's frustration seems reasonable because they're already paying for the kids' support. The ex might be overstepping by expecting the kids to cover additional costs with their own money. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid point about the child support covering essentials, and the ex's approach might be unfair. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
