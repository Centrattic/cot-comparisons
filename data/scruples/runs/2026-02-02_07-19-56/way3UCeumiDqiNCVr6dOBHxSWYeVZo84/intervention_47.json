      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, pays around $2,000 a month in child support, and has 50% custody of his kids. The kids are 10 and 9 years old. The son asked if he can use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk for his room at his mom's house. The author is upset because the ex-wife gets child support but still wants the kids to use their savings for furniture at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects here. The author is paying child support, which is supposed to cover the child's needs. The ex-wife is probably supposed to allocate that money towards the children's expenses. However, the ex-wife might be asking the kids to use their own savings for furniture, which could be seen as not utilizing the child support properly. \n\nBut the author is also the one who gave the kids the savings. If the savings were given as gifts or part of allowance, the kids might have a right to use them as they see fit. The author might feel like the ex is not using the child support effectively, expecting the kids to cover additional costs. However, the author is also in a position where they might not want to support purchases that are for the ex's house, especially if they feel the child support isn't being used appropriately.\n\nLegally, child support is meant to cover the child's needs, which includes furniture. The ex-wife might be responsible for providing the necessary furniture, and expecting the child to use their savings could be seen as shifting that responsibility. However, if the child has their own savings, they might have the right to spend them. \n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated because they're paying support and now have to cover additional costs for the other parent's house. The ex-wife might be trying to teach the kids financial responsibility by using their savings, but it could come across as not respecting the support arrangement.\n\nI need to balance these factors. The author is upset because the ex is using the child's savings instead of the child support. But if the savings were given by the author, maybe the author expects them to be used for the child's needs regardless of where they live. However, the ex has the right to manage her household, and the child might want to buy furniture for their room there. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is not necessarily wrong if the child support is supposed to cover furniture. The ex might be wrong if she's not using the support for the child's needs. But the author's frustration is understandable. However, the author is also trying to control the kids' savings, which they might have given as gifts. If the kids want to use their own money, it's their right. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is withholding the child's money from being used for their own needs, that's problematic. But if the child support is supposed to cover furniture, then the ex should handle that. The author might be in the right to be upset if the ex isn't using the support properly, but the kids should have autonomy over their own savings. Therefore, maybe the author is not in the wrong for being upset, but the ex could be at fault for not covering the furniture costs with the support. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
