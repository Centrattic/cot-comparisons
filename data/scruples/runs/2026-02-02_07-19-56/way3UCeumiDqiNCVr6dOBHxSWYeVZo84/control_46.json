      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the ex-wife making the kids use their savings from the author's house to buy furniture for their ex's home. The author pays child support and has 50% custody.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is divorced, has two kids, and pays $2000 in child support. The kids have savings at the author's house. The son wants to use that money to buy a desk for his room at the ex's house. The author is upset because the ex is taking child support but also expecting the kids to use their own money for essentials at her house.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for being angry about this. The author is considering if they are the asshole for being upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nChild support is usually intended to cover the child's needs, right? So if the ex is receiving child support, which is meant to help with the kids' expenses, then expecting the kids to pay out of their own savings for furniture might be adding to the costs beyond what's already covered by the child support. That could be seen as unfair. The author is paying for the kids' needs through support, but the ex is then making the kids use their personal savings for items that should be covered by the support.\n\nHowever, the kids have their own savings. If the son has earned or saved that money, maybe it's his to use as he sees fit. But since the kids are minors, their financial decisions might involve both parents. The ex might have control over their finances at her house, but the author might feel that the savings are under his care during his custody time.\n\nAlso, the author has 50% custody, so maybe the savings are split between both households. The fact that the desk is needed at the ex's house complicates things. If the ex is using child support to cover general expenses, then the furniture is an additional cost. The author might feel that the ex isn't using the child support appropriately if she's making the kids pay for essentials out of their own money.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being angry? The author is paying child support, which is supposed to cover the children's needs. If the ex isn't using that money for the kids' necessities and instead is making them use their personal funds, that could be a problem. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the children's savings are their own, so if they want to use their money for their room, maybe that's their choice. But since they're kids, they might not have the autonomy to decide that.\n\nAnother angle: the ex might be trying to teach the kids responsibility by letting them use their savings for furniture. But if the child support isn't covering essentials, the ex could be at fault. The author might feel that the furniture is an essential item, and it's the ex's responsibility to provide it with the child support she's receiving.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, child support is typically for the child's needs. If the ex is using the support for general living expenses and then expecting the kids to pay for their own furniture, that could be a misuse of the support funds. The author might be right to be upset because the ex isn't covering the essentials with the support money.\n\nBut the author is also providing essentials at his house, so maybe the ex is just managing the other household. If the kids have everything they need at the author's house but not at the ex's, maybe the ex isn't meeting her responsibilities. However, the author is paying child support, which is supposed to help cover the ex's expenses.\n\nThe key here is whether the furniture is an essential item that should be covered by the child support. If it is, then the ex is not using the support appropriately by making the kids pay for it. Therefore, the author being angry is justified, so he's not the asshole. But if the furniture is a non-essential or a personal choice, then maybe the ex isn't wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's anger is likely justified because the child support is meant to cover the kids' needs, including furniture. The ex expecting the kids to use their own savings after receiving child support could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
