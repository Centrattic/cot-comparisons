      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the ex-wife making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house, even though the author is paying child support. The kids have a 50-50 custody arrangement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's expenses, so if the ex is using the child's savings for furniture, that might be an issue. But the author is giving the kids an allowance, which they saved up. The ex is asking them to spend their own money on essentials at her house. \n\nThe author is upset because the ex is getting child support but still expects the kids to pay for furniture. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, so the ex might be at fault here. However, if the ex is asking the kids to use their own savings for their room, maybe it's about financial responsibility. The kids have their own savings, so using them might be acceptable if the furniture is necessary. \n\nBut the author is paying child support, which should cover those essentials. The ex might be overstepping by making the kids use their personal savings for furniture. The author's anger might be justified because the child support is supposed to cover those costs. However, the author is also allowing the kids to access their savings at his house, which could mean he's complicit in letting them use their own money for that purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as inconsiderate if he's giving the kids money to save and then being upset when they use it. But since the ex is the one asking for it, the main issue might be her request. The author's anger is directed at the ex's actions, not the kids. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is not allowing the kids to spend their money as they see fit, that could be an issue. But if the problem is the ex's request, then the author is correct to be upset. The key point is whether the child support covers furniture. If it does, the ex shouldn't expect the kids to pay. If not, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the author is also the one who's supposed to be paying for the essentials, so expecting the kids to use their own money might be unfair. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the ex is the one making the request, and the author is upset about the ex's actions, not the kids'. The author is justified in being angry that the ex uses child support but still expects the kids to pay for furniture. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
