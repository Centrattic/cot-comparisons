      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is divorced, has 50% custody of their kids, and pays around $2000 in child support each month. The kids are 10 and 9 years old. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk for his room at his mother's house.\n\nThe author is upset because they're paying child support but the ex-wife is making the kids use their own money for furniture at her house. They're considering whether to let the son buy the furniture or not and are wondering if they're the asshole for being angry about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Typically, child support is intended to cover the children's needs, including things like furniture. If the ex is getting child support, she should be responsible for providing necessary items like furniture. Making the kids use their own savings for that might be unfair because the parent receiving child support has a duty to cover those expenses.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The kids have their own savings, maybe from gifts or allowance. But if the furniture is considered a necessity, it's reasonable for the parent to cover that with child support funds. The author is paying a significant amount in support, so expecting the ex to handle essential items makes sense. The ex's request might be putting the responsibility on the kids, which could be seen as not fulfilling her part of the custody agreement.\n\nHowever, the kids have their own money, so maybe they can choose to use it if they want. But the parent might not have a say in that. The author is frustrated because they feel the ex isn't using the child support properly. It's possible the ex isn't obligated to explain how she uses the support, unless there's a specific court order. But generally, child support is supposed to be used for the child's needs, so if she's making them pay for their own furniture, that could be an issue.\n\nThe author's reaction is anger, which is a normal response to feeling wronged. However, they need to consider if they have the right to control the kids' savings. If the savings were given by the author, maybe they have a say, but if the kids earned or saved it themselves, it's their money. But the children are minors, so their parents typically manage their finances.\n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the author's frustration is understandable. The ex isn't using child support for essentials and is pushing the responsibility onto the kids. However, the author should check the custody agreement and any legal terms regarding child support and expenses. If the agreement states that essentials are covered by support, then the ex might be in the wrong. But if there's no such agreement, maybe it's a grey area.\n\nAlso, the author might need to communicate with the ex to resolve this instead of taking it out on the kid. Maybe there's a misunderstanding or financial constraints on the ex's side. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not how to fix it.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The ex should cover the furniture with child support, and using the kids' savings for that might not be appropriate. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
