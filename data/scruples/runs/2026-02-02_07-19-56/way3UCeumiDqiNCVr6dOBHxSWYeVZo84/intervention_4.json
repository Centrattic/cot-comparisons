      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong when he's upset that his ex-wife expects their kids to use their savings to buy furniture at her house, even though he pays child support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody arrangement. They have 50% custody, so both parents are responsible for the kids' needs. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the costs of raising the children. But in this case, the author has 50% custody, so maybe the child support is split differently? However, the exact custody arrangement might not be the main issue here.\n\nThe key point is the ex-wife asking the kids to use their saved money to buy furniture at her house. The author is upset because he's already paying child support and feels it's unfair that the ex is making the kids use their personal savings for this. The kids have their own savings from the author's house, which they want to use for a desk in their room at the ex's house.\n\nThe author's argument is that since he's paying child support, the ex should cover the furniture costs. The ex, on the other hand, might be relying on the kids' savings to purchase necessary items. The question is whether it's reasonable for the ex to expect the kids to use their own money for such purchases when the author is already paying child support.\n\nI think the author has a valid point. Child support is meant to cover the child's living expenses, including furniture. If the ex is receiving child support, it's reasonable to expect that she uses those funds for the child's needs, not to force the child to use their personal savings. However, the kids might have their own savings from allowances or gifts, so maybe it's their choice to spend it. But the parent should cover essentials with the child support. The ex might be shifting the financial responsibility onto the child, which isn't appropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The correct answer is B.\n"
