      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is divorced, has two kids with 50% custody, and pays $2,000 in child support. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk at the ex-wife's house. The author is upset that the ex-wife is getting child support but still expects the kids to use their saved money for furniture at her place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody arrangement. 50% custody means the kids split their time evenly between both parents. So, each parent is responsible for the kids' needs during their time. The ex-wife receives child support, which is presumably to help cover the costs of raising the children. But the author is now being asked to let the son use his savings from the author's house to buy furniture for the ex-wife's home.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel like the ex-wife is getting child support but still expecting the kids to contribute their own money for furniture. Is that fair? Well, the child support is meant to cover the expenses of the child's upbringing. If the ex-wife is using the child support for other things, maybe the author has a point. However, the son's savings are his own money, saved up from maybe allowance or gifts. The author might be concerned that the ex-wife isn't using the child support appropriately or that the kids are being made to cover costs that should be the ex-wife's responsibility.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the kids have their own savings, they might want to use it for their own needs. The author is the one who gives the son the savings, so allowing him to use it could be seen as supporting the child's wishes. However, the author might feel that the ex-wife isn't contributing enough, especially since she's getting child support. The key here is whether the ex-wife is using the child support for the child's basic needs or if she's expecting the kids to pay for things they should be covered by the support.\n\nAnother angle is the custody split. Since the kids are in both homes, maybe the furniture is for their time at the ex-wife's house. If the ex-wife is responsible for providing the necessary furniture during her custody time, using the child's savings might not be the right approach. The child support should cover those costs. Therefore, the author might be justified in being upset because the ex-wife isn't covering the expenses she's responsible for, instead shifting the cost to the child's savings.\n\nBut then, the author is the one who gives the savings to the son, so if the son wants to use it, maybe the author should let him. However, if the ex-wife is using the child support for other things and making the kids pay for furniture, that could be seen as unfair. The author might be right to be angry because the ex-wife isn't fulfilling her part in covering the costs during her custody.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the ex-wife is using the child support properly. If she's using it for other things and expecting the kids to cover furniture, that's on her. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset about that. The author is paying child support to cover the kids' needs, and if the ex-wife isn't doing that, the author has a valid complaint. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
