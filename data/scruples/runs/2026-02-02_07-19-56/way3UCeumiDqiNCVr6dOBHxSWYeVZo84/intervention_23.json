      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a divorced parent who's upset that his ex-wife expects their kids to use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though he pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has 50% custody and pays $2,000 in child support. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk for his room at his mother's house. The author is angry about this, thinking it's unfair since he's already paying child support and the kids have essentials at his place.\n\nThe key points here are the custody arrangement, the amount of child support, and the responsibility for providing furniture. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's needs, including things like housing, food, clothing, and furniture. So if the ex is receiving child support, she should theoretically be responsible for those expenses. However, the author is now being asked to have the kids use their own savings for furniture, which the author sees as unfair.\n\nBut wait, the kids have savings from the author's house. If the son has his own savings, maybe he's allowed to use that money for things he wants, regardless of where he lives. The author might be concerned that the ex isn't contributing to the furniture costs since she's getting child support. On the other hand, the ex might be trying to teach the kids to manage their own money or encourage saving.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, the author is paying child support, so the ex should be responsible for the kids' needs. If the ex is making the kids use their own money for furniture, that might be shifting the responsibility away from her, which the author is justified in being upset about. However, the kids are using their own savings, so maybe the author has a point in being frustrated that the ex isn't covering the furniture costs.\n\nBut the author is also the one who allowed the kids to have the savings in the first place. If the son is saving his own money, it's his to use as he sees fit. The author might feel that the ex is not covering the essentials, but if the kids have essentials at the author's place, maybe the ex isn't obligated to provide the same at her house. But child support typically covers both households, so the ex should be responsible for furniture at her house.\n\nSo, the author's anger might stem from the fact that the ex isn't using the child support to cover furniture costs, which is her responsibility. However, the author is also allowing the kids to use their own money, which could be seen as expecting the kids to cover their own expenses. But the kids have two households, and it's reasonable for each parent to cover the essentials in their home. If the ex is using child support but not providing necessary items, that's an issue. But the question is whether the author is wrong for being upset about the kids using their own money.\n\nIn terms of parenting, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be right to be upset because the ex should cover furniture with child support. However, the kids are using their own savings, which is their own money. The author might be projecting his frustration about the ex not covering expenses onto the kids. Alternatively, maybe the author is right to be upset because the ex is not fulfilling her responsibility, and the kids shouldn't have to use their savings for that.\n\nI think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong. The ex is receiving child support and should be covering the necessary items for the kids, including furniture. The author has a valid point in being upset that the ex is making the kids use their own money for things that should be covered by the child support. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
