      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person posting the question) is the asshole in their situation. They're divorced, have 50% custody, pay $2000 in child support, and their ex is asking their kids to use their own savings to buy furniture for their mom's house.\n\nFirst, the child support is already covering the kids' basic needs, right? The ex is getting that money, which should be for essentials. If the kids have their own savings from the dad, maybe they want to use that for a desk. But the dad is upset because he feels the ex shouldn't expect the kids to use their saved money for that.\n\nHmm, is it fair? Well, the child support is supposed to cover the kids' expenses. If the ex is using the child support for basics and then also asking the kids to buy furniture from their own savings, that might be a bit much. The dad might be right to be upset. The kids have their own savings, maybe from gifts or allowance, so they might want to use it for things in their own rooms. But the dad's custody is 50%, so he's responsible for half the time. If the ex is making the kids use their own money for furniture in her house, maybe she should cover that part. \n\nOn the other hand, if the kids are given an allowance, maybe they have some freedom to spend it as they wish. But the key point here is that the ex is getting child support but also expecting the kids to cover additional expenses. Child support is supposed to cover the kids' needs, so the ex might be in the wrong here. The dad is paying for the essentials, and the ex is adding extra costs on top. So the dad isn't the asshole for being upset. He might need to talk to the ex about covering those expenses since they're part of the child's living arrangements. \n\nAlso, the kids are 10 and 9, so their savings might not be a lot. If the ex is making them spend their own money on furniture, that could set a bad precedent. The dad's right to be concerned. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
