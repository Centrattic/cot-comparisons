      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent who pays child support and has 50% custody. The ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house, even though the author is paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including furniture and furnishings. If the ex is receiving child support, she should be responsible for those expenses. Making the kids use their savings for essentials at her house might be unfair because the support is supposed to cover that.\n\nNext, the emotional side. The father is upset because he's already paying support and doesn't want the kids to have to spend their own money. It's reasonable for him to be frustrated if the ex isn't using the support for the intended purposes. However, the kids might have their own savings from gifts or allowance, so maybe the ex is encouraging them to use their own money for personal items, which could be seen as teaching responsibility.\n\nBut wait, furniture for a child's room is usually a parental responsibility. If the ex is making the kids pay for it themselves, that could be shifting the financial burden from the parent to the child, which isn't appropriate. The child support should cover such expenses. The father's anger stems from the ex not fulfilling her part of the agreement, which is about dividing responsibilities fairly.\n\nAlso, the fact that the kids have essentials at his house but need to buy them at their mother's house might mean the ex isn't maintaining the same standard of living. That could be a point in the father's favor. The key here is whether the ex is using the child support properly. If she's not, then the father has a right to be upset.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the kids have their own savings from chores or gifts, and the ex is allowing them to use that money for personal purchases. But even then, a parent should cover the cost of furniture unless it's a special request beyond basics. So the ex's approach might be unreasonable.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex should be responsible for furnishing the home where the kids live, especially since she receives child support. The father's frustration is valid because the support is meant to cover those costs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
