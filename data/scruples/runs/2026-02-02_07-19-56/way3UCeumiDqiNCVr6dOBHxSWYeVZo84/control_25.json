      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where their ex-wife makes the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house. The author pays child support and has 50% custody.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child support laws. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including things like furniture. If the ex is receiving child support, it's reasonable to expect that she uses those funds for the children's necessities. Asking the kids to use their own savings for something like a desk might be seen as inappropriate because the parent is already receiving financial support from the other parent.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that the ex is not using the child support properly. However, the kids have their own savings, which they might have earned through allowance or other means. Allowing the kids to use their money for their own needs isn't inherently wrong. But the key point is whether the ex should be making the children spend their personal savings on essentials that should be covered by her own resources, including the child support she receives.\n\nSince the ex has legal custody for half the time, she should be responsible for providing necessary items during that time. Using the kids' savings might be shifting that responsibility onto the children, which isn't fair. The author's frustration is valid because the child support is supposed to cover these costs. The ex's actions could be seen as not fulfilling her financial obligations, even if she's receiving support.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The ex might be the one at fault here for not using the child support appropriately. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
