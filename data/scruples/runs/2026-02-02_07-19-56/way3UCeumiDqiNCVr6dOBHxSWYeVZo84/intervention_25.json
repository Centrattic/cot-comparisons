      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the father is giving the kids 50% custody, paying $2000 in child support, and now the ex is making the kids use their savings from his house to buy furniture for their room at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The father is paying child support, which is supposed to cover the kids' expenses. If the ex is making the kids use their own money for furniture, that might be an issue because the child support should cover those essentials. The father is upset that the ex is expecting the kids to take their saved money, which he provided as pocket money, to pay for things that the ex is responsible for covering through the child support.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs. If the ex is not using her share of the child support to buy necessary items like furniture, then it's her responsibility. The kids' savings might be money given by the father as allowance or pocket money, which the kids might have earned or received as gifts. Using that for furniture could be seen as the ex not fulfilling her financial obligations.\n\nBut emotionally, the father is frustrated because he's already paying child support and doesn't want his kids to have to spend their own money for things they should have at both homes. However, the father also has the choice to let the kids use their savings if they want. Maybe the father is projecting his own frustration onto the situation rather than the kids' needs.\n\nAnother angle: if the kids have savings from their own efforts (like allowance or gifts), they might want to use them for their own purposes. The ex's request could be seen as pushing the financial burden onto the kids, which isn't fair. The father's anger might be justified because the ex isn't covering the essentials with her share of the child support.\n\nBut is the father in the wrong? If he's withholding the kids' money from their own savings, does that set a bad example? Or is he right to be upset that the ex isn't using the child support as intended? It's a bit of a gray area. However, the key point is that the ex should be responsible for the kids' needs at her house with the child support she receives. Using the kids' personal money for that isn't appropriate. Therefore, the father's frustration is valid, and he's not in the wrong for being upset. He might not be in the wrong for not allowing the use of the savings, as he's standing up for his responsibility and the proper use of child support.\n"
