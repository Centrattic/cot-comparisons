      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent with 50% custody, paying $2000 in child support, and their ex-wife making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house. The author is upset because they feel like they're already paying for the kids' needs through child support, yet the ex is making the kids spend their own saved money on essentials at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including furniture. If the ex is refusing to use the child support for that, it might be an issue. But since the author is only responsible for their 50% custody, maybe the child support is calculated accordingly. The ex might be using the support for her 50% share, so the author's part is covered for when the kids are with them. However, if the ex isn't using the child support to buy necessary items, that could be a problem.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The kids have savings from the author's house, and the ex is making them use that money for their room at her house. The author is upset because they feel like they're already covering the costs through support and shouldn't have to fund the ex's household. But the kids' savings are their own, right? If the kids have saved their allowance or earned money, using it for personal items might be reasonable. However, the author might feel it's unfair to expect them to spend their own money on essentials that the ex should be covering with the child support.\n\nAlso, the custody arrangement is 50-50. So each parent is responsible for the child's needs when they're in their care. The author's house already has all the essentials, but the ex's house doesn't. The child support might be intended to cover the ex's share of expenses. If the ex isn't using the child support to buy necessary furniture, that could be a breach of responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset if the ex is not fulfilling her part.\n\nAnother angle: the author is providing the kids with a desk at their house, but the ex expects the kids to use their own money for the same at her house. It's possible that the ex isn't meeting her responsibilities as a co-parent, which is frustrating. The author's anger might stem from the ex not covering the costs she should be handling, making the author not the asshole.\n\nBut then again, the kids have their own savings. If the author is giving them pocket money, the kids have the right to spend it as they see fit. However, the ex making them spend it on furniture could be seen as pressuring them. The author is upset because they feel the ex is not covering basic needs, which is their responsibility. So the author isn't wrong in being upset. The ex might be the one in the wrong for not using child support appropriately. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
