      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent who's upset because their ex-wife is making their kids use their savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though the father is paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The father is paying child support, which is supposed to cover the child's needs. If the ex is requiring the child to use their own savings for furniture, which is an essential item, that might not align with the purpose of child support. The father's responsibility to provide for the child's basic needs should extend to both households, especially since he has 50% custody. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The father is upset because he's already contributing financially, and it feels like the ex isn't using the child support effectively. The kids have savings from the father's home, but using their own money for furniture at the mother's house might not be fair, especially if the child support is supposed to cover those expenses. \n\nAlso, the kids are minors, so their savings might be a result of the father's contributions (like pocket money). The ex's request could be seen as shifting the financial burden onto the children, which isn't appropriate. The father has a right to be concerned about where the child support money is going if it's not being used for the child's needs. \n\nHowever, I should check if the father has any responsibility here. If he gave the child the savings as a gift or through allowance, the child technically owns that money. But since the child is a minor, the parents (both) are responsible for managing those funds appropriately, which includes using them for the child's benefit. However, the ex is asking the child to use their own savings for a necessity, which the child support should cover. \n\nIn terms of custody and financial obligations, the father is paying his share, so the ex shouldn't be making the child deplete their savings for basic needs. The father's anger is justified because it's the parent's responsibility, not the child's, to provide for such essentials. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex is misusing the child support arrangement by expecting the child to cover necessary expenses that should be covered by the support payments. The father is right to be upset because it's the parents' duty, not the child's, to ensure they have the necessary items for their well-being.\n"
