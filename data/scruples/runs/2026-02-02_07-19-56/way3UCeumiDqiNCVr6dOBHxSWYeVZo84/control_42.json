      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that his ex-wife expects their kids to use their savings for furniture at her house. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're divorced, 50-50 custody, paying $2k in child support. The kids have savings from the father's house. The son wants to use that money to buy a desk at the mom's house. The father is upset that the ex gets child support but still expects the kids to spend their own money on furniture at her place.\n\nSo, the key points here. Child support is meant to cover the kids' needs. The mother is getting child support but is making the kids use their own savings for furniture. That seems conflicting because if child support is supposed to cover essentials, including furniture, maybe the mother should be using that money instead of the kids' savings. \n\nBut wait, maybe the mother is not using the child support for furniture, so she's expecting the kids to pay out of their own savings. That could be a problem. The father is right to question why he's paying child support if it's not covering those expenses. \n\nThe kids have their own savings, but using that for furniture at the mother's house might be an issue. The father might feel like he's already contributing through child support and shouldn't have to provide additional funds. Also, the mother's actions could be seen as not using the child support properly, which is her responsibility. \n\nThe father's anger is about the ex expecting the kids to spend their own money on things that should be covered by the child support. So, the argument is whether the mother is using the child support correctly. If the child support isn't covering furniture, maybe the mother is at fault here. The father isn't in the wrong for being upset because the ex isn't using the support money as intended, making the kids pay out of their own savings. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mother is within her rights to use the child support as she sees fit, but expecting the kids to use their savings is another matter. However, the father might be right to be upset because the child support should cover those costs. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's justified in being upset because the ex is expecting the kids to pay for things that should be covered by the child support he's already paying.\n"
