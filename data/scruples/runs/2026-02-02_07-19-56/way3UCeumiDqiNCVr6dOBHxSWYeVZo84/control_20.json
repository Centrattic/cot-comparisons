      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a divorced parent who is upset that their ex-wife is making their kids use their own savings to buy furniture for the mother's house. The author is paying child support and has 50% custody.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's needs, so if the mother isn't using it for essentials, that could be a point. But the law varies by location, so maybe the court intended the support to cover all expenses. However, the kids are using their own money for furniture, which is a discretionary expense. The author is angry because they feel the ex is not using the child support appropriately.\n\nEmotionally, the author might feel like their money isn't being used for the kids' benefit. But the ex isn't legally required to inform the author about how she's spending the child support. The kids using their savings is their own money, so maybe the author overreacted. However, the kids are children, and their savings might not be significant. The author's anger could be justified if they feel the ex is being unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex isn't obligated to let the author handle all purchases. If the kids want to buy a desk at their mother's house, using their own money might be a way to teach them responsibility. But asking kids to use their savings for furniture is a bit much. The author isn't in the wrong if they're upset about the ex not covering essentials with the child support.\n\nI think the key points are whether the ex is using the child support correctly and if the kids' savings are being used for necessary items. The author isn't wrong for being upset. The ex should cover furniture with the child support. So the answer is B.\n"
