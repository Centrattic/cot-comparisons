      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a divorced parent with 50% custody, paying $2,000 in child support per month. The kids are 10 and 9 years old. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk for his room at the ex's house.\n\nThe author is upset that the ex is getting child support but still expects the kids to use their saved money for furniture at her house. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for being angry about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and financial aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including furniture. If the ex is receiving $2,000 a month, it's possible that the furniture should be covered under that support. The ex might not be using the child support for essentials, expecting the kids to cover furniture with their own savings, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nHowever, the kids' savings are their own money. If the son earned the savings through allowance or other means, using it for a desk is his choice. The author might feel that the ex is offloading expenses onto them, but the kids have the right to use their own money as they see fit. The author's anger could stem from feeling that the ex isn't using child support appropriately, but the kids' money is separate.\n\nAnother angle: the author has 50% custody, so both households are responsible for the kids. If the ex expects the kids to bring their personal savings to her house, that might be a boundary issue. The author could be right to be upset because the ex isn't covering necessary expenses from the child support she's receiving.\n\nBut maybe the author is overstepping by not allowing the son to use his savings. If the money is the son's, he should have some autonomy in how he uses it. If the author is preventing the son from using his own money, that could be seen as controlling. However, the author might be trying to protect the son from the ex's behavior.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, so the ex should be responsible for furniture. The author's frustration is understandable if the ex isn't fulfilling that responsibility. But the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset; it's about the ex's responsibility. The author isn't the one at fault here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
