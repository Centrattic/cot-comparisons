      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is divorced and has 50% custody. They pay $2000 child support. Their son wants to use his savings from the dad's house to buy a desk at the mom's house. The dad is upset that the ex-wife is taking the child's saved money for furniture.\n\nFirst, the child's savings are their own, right? If the kid has money saved from allowance or something, maybe the dad is okay with them using it. But the ex is making them use that money for furniture at her house. The dad is paying child support, which is supposed to cover the child's expenses, so maybe he feels it's unfair to take the kid's savings for things that should be covered by the child support.\n\nBut the ex is the one with primary custody? Wait, no, it's 50-50. So each parent is responsible for the kids half the time. Maybe the furniture is for the time the kid spends at the mom's house. If the mom is getting child support, she should be responsible for providing furniture. If the kid is using his own money, maybe the dad is right to be upset because it's taking the child's savings for something the ex should handle.\n\nAlso, the child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, so if the ex isn't using it for that, the dad might feel wronged. But if the kid wants to use his own money, maybe that's up to the kid. But the dad is the one who allows the kid to take the savings, so maybe he's in a position to say yes or no. If the ex is pressuring the kid to use their own money, that's an issue. The dad is justified in being upset because the ex is using the child support funds (which he pays) but also expecting the kid's savings for furniture. So the answer is B, the dad is not in the wrong.\n"
