      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person writing the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's ex-wife making their kids buy their own furniture. The author gives 50% custody and pays $2000 in child support. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk at the ex-wife's home. The author is upset because they feel they already pay child support and shouldn't have to cover extra expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support typically covers the child's basic needs, including furniture. If the ex-wife is getting child support, she should be responsible for providing essentials like furniture. The kids' saved money is their own, but the author is upset that the ex wants the kids to use their savings for her house when the author's house already has everything.\n\nThe author's frustration makes sense because they might feel they're covering all costs and shouldn't have to fund extra items. However, the ex-wife might see the child support as covering basics, and personal savings can be used for additional items. The kids have their own money, so using it isn't necessarily the author's responsibility. But the author might feel it's unfair to expect them to use their savings for the ex's house.\n\nLegally, child support should cover furniture, so the ex shouldn't require the kids to buy their own. However, the kids' savings are theirs to use as they wish. The author's anger could be about the ex not covering essentials and instead shifting the cost to the kids. Alternatively, the author might be justified in feeling that their child support already covers these things, and the ex is making the kids use their own money, which is unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the ex is using the child support but not covering essentials, then she's in the wrong. But if the author is refusing to let the kid use his savings for his own needs at his mother's house, maybe the author is being unreasonable. However, the author isn't the one requiring the ex to cover it; the ex is making the kid use his savings. The author might be right to be upset because the ex should be responsible for the furniture since she's receiving child support. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as the ex is the one not covering the essentials, not the author.\n"
