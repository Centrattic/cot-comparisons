      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2000 in child support. His son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk in his mom's house. The author is upset because the ex is getting child support but also wants the kids to use their savings for items at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is supposed to cover the child's needs. If the ex is receiving child support, then she's supposed to handle the expenses for the child's care. If the kids are spending their own savings on furniture, maybe that's an issue because the child support is meant to cover those costs. The ex isn't contributing her share, so making the kids use their savings could be unfair.\n\nBut then, the kids have their own savings. The author is angry that the ex isn't covering the essentials with the child support. It's possible that the ex isn't using the child support for necessary items, so the kids have to dip into their own money. That seems wrong because the child support is her responsibility.\n\nThe author is justified in being upset if the ex isn't using the child support appropriately. The kids' savings are their own, but if the ex is supposed to cover furniture with her share of the expenses, then making the kids pay is not right. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The problem lies with the ex not fulfilling her part.\n\nAlso, the kids have essentials at the author's house, so maybe the ex is asking for more than necessary. The author is right to question why the ex isn't using the child support for that. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
