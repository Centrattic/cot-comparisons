      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-wife is making the kids use their saved money from the father's house to buy furniture for their room at the mother's house. The father is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2000 in child support, and is upset that the ex is expecting the kids to use their savings for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs. If the mother is using the child's saved money for essentials, that might not be appropriate because child support should already cover those costs. The father is paying support, so the mother should be responsible for those expenses. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. The kids are using their savings to buy a desk, which is a personal choice, but the fact that the mother is redirecting that saved money to cover her own responsibilities (like furniture) could be seen as unfair. The father might feel that he's already covering the necessary expenses through child support, so expecting the kids to pay for furniture with their savings adds an extra burden. \n\nAlso, the kids have 50% custody, so they split their time. The father might be upset that the mother isn't using her own resources or the child support to cover these items. It's possible that the kids have a savings account set up by the father, and the mother is now asking them to use that money for her house, which could be seen as placing an unfair expectation on the children.\n\nBut some might argue that the kids' savings are their own, and they can choose how to spend it, even if it's for their room at the mother's house. However, the mother shouldn't be making the children use their savings for things that should be covered by child support. The father's anger is justified because he's covering the costs through child support, so the mother shouldn't be shifting that responsibility to the children.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the father is upset about the mother's actions, but is he in the wrong for being angry? Probably not. The mother is not fulfilling her responsibility to cover the child's needs with the support she's receiving. The father's frustration is valid because he's already paying for the essentials. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
