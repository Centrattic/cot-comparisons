      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-wife makes the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house, even though the author is paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has 50% custody and pays $2,000 in child support. The kids have savings from his house, and the son wants to use that to buy a desk at the mom's house. The author is upset because he's paying support but the ex expects the kids to cover furniture costs from their saved money.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's reasonable for the ex-wife to expect the kids to pay for furniture in her home. Child support is meant to cover general expenses like food, housing, and education. If the ex is using the child support for essentials, but then making the kids pay for furniture, that might be on thin ice.\n\nBut wait, the kids have their own savings. The son wants to use his savings, which the author might have contributed to through pocket money. The author is upset because he's already paying child support and now the ex wants the kids' personal savings for furniture. That could be seen as the ex not using the child support effectively, or maybe overstepping by involving the kids' money.\n\nI need to consider custody arrangements. Since it's 50-50, both parents are responsible for the kids' needs. If the kids have their own items, like a desk, but the ex's house doesn't have it, maybe that's a problem. However, using the kids' savings for that might be a stretch. The author is justified in being upset because the child support should cover such essentials, not the kids' personal funds.\n\nAlso, the author might be right to question if the ex is meeting her responsibility. If the ex is making the kids pay for furniture, it could be a way to shift financial responsibility onto the kids, which isn't fair. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry about it. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
