      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for being upset that his ex-wife expects their kids to use their saved money to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though he's paying child support. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user is divorced, has 50% custody, pays around $2000 in child support monthly. His son wants to use his savings from the father's house to buy a desk for his room at the mother's house. The father is angry because he's paying child support yet the ex is making the kids use their savings for essentials.\n\nSo, the key points here: Child support is supposed to cover the kids' needs. If the ex is receiving child support, she should be responsible for providing necessary items like furniture. The father is paying for that already, so expecting the kids to take their own money (which was given by the father as pocket money) to buy furniture might be unfair. The father might feel that since he's contributing financially, the ex shouldn't make the kids dip into their savings for things that the child support is supposed to cover.\n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the kid has personal savings from gifts or allowance, and using that for personal items like a desk is okay. However, if the ex is making it a requirement that the kids have to pay out of their own money for essentials, that might be problematic. The child support is meant to cover those essentials. So if the ex is not using the child support for that and instead making the kids use their own money, that's an issue.\n\nAlso, since the father is paying child support, he might not be responsible for providing furniture for the kids at the mother's house. The ex is supposed to take care of their living arrangement. If she's not doing that, then the father isn't in the wrong for being upset. The money he's paying should cover those expenses. The fact that the son has savings might be from the father's contributions (like pocket money or gifts), so using that to buy furniture meant for the mother's house where the child support is supposed to cover it could be seen as the ex not fulfilling her financial responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: If the kids have their own savings, maybe they can choose to spend it on personal items. But if it's a necessity and the child support is supposed to cover it, the mother shouldn't be making the kid use their own money. The father's anger might be justified because he's already covering those costs through child support, so the ex shouldn't expect the kids to take their own money for things that should be covered by the support.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, and each parent is responsible for their respective household's expenses. If the mother isn't using the child support for necessary items, that's her issue. The father isn't obligated to provide furniture for the other house beyond what's in his custody. So the father isn't wrong for being upset. The ex might be overstepping by expecting the kids to use their savings for that, especially since she's already receiving child support.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
