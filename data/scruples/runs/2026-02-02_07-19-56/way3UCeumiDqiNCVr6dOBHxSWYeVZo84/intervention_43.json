      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where the ex-wife makes the kids buy their own furniture using their savings. The author is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2000 in child support, and now the son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk for his mom's house. The author is angry about this and wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support typically covers the child's basic needs, including furniture. Since the author is paying child support, the ex-wife should be responsible for providing essential items like furniture. However, the ex is making the kids use their own savings for this, which might be seen as not fulfilling her responsibility.\n\nNext, the custody arrangement is 50-50. The author provides essentials at their place, but the ex is expecting the kids to cover furniture at her house. The author's frustration is understandable because they're paying support and providing for the kids at their home. If the ex is making the kids use their savings for furniture, maybe she's not covering that part of their needs through the child support, which is her responsibility.\n\nAlso, the kids' savings might have been given by the author as pocket money. If the author gave the kids money with the understanding it's for their personal use, then expecting them to use it for furniture at the other parent's house could be unfair. It's possible the ex is passing her responsibilities onto the kids, which isn't right. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author is overstepping by not allowing the son to use his savings if he wants to. However, the author is concerned that the ex is not using the child support for intended purposes. The key point is whether the ex is responsible for providing furniture, which she should be. If she's making the kids pay for it, that's on her, not the author. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because the ex should be covering those expenses with the child support. The author's anger is justified since they're already paying for that part. The ex's actions might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
