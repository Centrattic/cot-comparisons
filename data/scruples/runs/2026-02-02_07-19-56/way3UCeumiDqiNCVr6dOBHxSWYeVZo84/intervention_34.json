      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the dad is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2k in child support, and his son wants to use his savings to buy a desk for his room at the mom's house. The dad is upset because he's already paying child support but the ex is making the kids use their own money for furniture at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The dad is paying child support, which is supposed to cover the children's needs. However, the mom is making the kids use their own savings for things like furniture. The dad is angry because he's already contributing financially and doesn't want the kids to have to spend their money on essentials in her house. \n\nI should consider legal aspects first. In many places, child support is intended to cover the child's basic needs, including furnishings and furniture. If the mom is not using the child support for that purpose, maybe she's not fulfilling her responsibility. But laws can vary, so maybe the dad is right to be upset if the support is supposed to cover those expenses.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The kids have savings from pocket money, which they might have earned through chores or gifts. Using that money for a desk at mom's house might be a way for the kids to have some autonomy, but the dad might feel that the child support should cover all necessary items. The mom's request could be seen as shifting the financial burden onto the kids, which isn't fair if the child support isn't being used appropriately.\n\nAnother angle: the dad's right to control the kids' savings. If the money is the kids', they should have some say in how it's spent. However, the dad is the one who gave the savings (possibly from allowance or gifts), so he might feel a sense of ownership. But legally, the savings belong to the children, so maybe the dad shouldn't restrict them from using their own money.\n\nAlso, the dad's anger might be justified if the mom isn't providing a properly furnished home and is making the kids cover that. However, if the furniture is a personal desire rather than a necessity, the dad might be overstepping by denying them access to their own money. The key here is whether the desk is an essential item that should be covered by the child support versus a non-essential purchase.\n\nLooking at the community's perspective, some might say the dad is right because the mom should handle all necessary expenses with the child support. Others might argue that the kids should be able to manage their own money, especially if the dad is already paying for essentials. The question is about whether the dad is wrong for being angry in this situation.\n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole\" format, the answer often depends on balancing fairness and responsibilities. If the mom is not using child support for the kids' needs and is making them pay for things they should have, the dad's anger is justified. However, if the desk is a personal choice and the child support is being used for other needs, then the dad might be the asshole for not allowing the kids to use their own money.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the furniture is a necessity covered by the child support. If the child support is meant to cover such items, the mom should use it, and the dad is not wrong to be upset. If the child support isn't being used for that, then the dad is justified. However, if the desk is a personal choice, the dad restricting the kids' access to their own savings might be the issue. \n\nConsidering all that, the dad might not be in the wrong if the child support should cover furniture. So the answer would be B (No). But if the mom is just being cheap and the dad is right to be angry, then B. Alternatively, if the dad is being overly controlling, then A. I think the key is the responsibility of the ex to provide essentials. If the desk is essential and the support isn't covering it, the dad is right. If it's an extra, then maybe not. But the question is about the dad's anger. Since he's paying child support, expecting that the ex uses it for all necessary items, including furniture, makes sense. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
