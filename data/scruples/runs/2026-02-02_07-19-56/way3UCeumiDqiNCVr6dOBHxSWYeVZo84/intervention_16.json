      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody of his kids, and pays $2000 in child support. His son wants to use his savings to buy a desk for his room at the ex's house. The author is upset that the ex is getting child support but still wants the kids to use their saved money for furniture at her house. He's considering not allowing it and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. Child support is typically meant to cover the basic needs of the child, like food, clothing, housing, and education. It might not cover furniture specifically. The ex might be within her rights to expect that the child's room is adequately furnished, but if the child has savings from their own money, using that for a desk could be a personal choice.\n\nThe author is angry that the ex is getting child support but still expects the kids to use their own money for furniture. But if the child has the savings, maybe using that money is up to the child. However, the author might feel that the child support should cover all necessary expenses, including furniture, so the kids shouldn't have to dip into their savings. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex might not be responsible for covering all furniture purchases, especially if it's a discretionary item like a desk. The kids could have their own savings from allowances or other sources. The author might be overreacting if the ex isn't forcing the kids to use their money, but rather the kid is volunteering to do so. The author's reaction could be influenced by his frustration with the custody arrangement and child support. \n\nLegally, the ex has rights to make decisions regarding the child's living situation during her custody periods. If the desk is necessary for the child's education or comfort, the ex might be justified in expecting that it's provided. However, if the child has their own savings, using it is a choice they make. The author's anger might stem from feeling that he's already covering costs through child support and shouldn't have to manage other expenses related to the ex's home. \n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The ex might feel that the furniture is her responsibility since she's the one providing the home, but the child's savings are their own. The author might be right to question if the child support is covering those costs, but if it's not specified, then perhaps the ex isn't in the wrong. It's possible that the author is projecting his own frustration onto the situation rather than considering the child's autonomy to use their savings.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? If he's angry that the ex is getting child support but still expects furniture to be bought from the child's savings, maybe he's not in the wrong if the child support isn't covering those items. However, if the child support should cover all essential items and the ex isn't using it for that, then maybe she is in the wrong. But the key here is that the child is using their own money, not the ex's. So the author's anger might be misplaced. He might be right to be concerned if the child support isn't covering necessary items, but if it's optional or the child is using their own funds, then he's not necessarily the asshole. However, the author is reacting to a situation where his ex is making the kids buy their own furniture, but actually, it's the kid's own money. So maybe the ex isn't forcing it; the kid is choosing to use their savings. In that case, the author's anger is over something that's not the ex's doing but the child's choice. Therefore, the author might be overreacting and in the wrong for being angry about the child's decision to use their own money.\n"
