      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a divorced parent who's upset that their ex-wife is making their kids use their own savings to buy furniture for the ex's house. The author pays child support and has 50% custody.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, child support is supposed to cover the kids' needs. The ex receiving child support but then making the kids use their own money for furniture might be an issue. But the kids' savings are their own, right? If the kids have saved their own money from allowance or gifts, the parents might not have control over that. \n\nThe author is angry because they think the ex should cover the furniture costs since they're receiving child support. But maybe the ex is trying to teach the kids responsibility by letting them use their savings. However, buying furniture is a significant expense, and it's not clear if the kids have enough saved up. \n\nAlso, the author's custody is 50%, so both households should be responsible for the kids' needs. If the ex is making the kids bring their own money for things that should be covered by child support, that's a problem. The author might be right to be upset because the ex is shifting financial responsibility onto the kids. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the kids' autonomy. If they want to spend their own money, maybe they should be allowed. However, furniture isn't something a kid would typically buy on their own. It's more of a parental responsibility. So maybe the ex is incorrect in expecting the kids to handle that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The ex should cover the furniture costs as part of the child support. The author's anger is justified because the ex is using the child support but then making the kids pay for essentials. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
