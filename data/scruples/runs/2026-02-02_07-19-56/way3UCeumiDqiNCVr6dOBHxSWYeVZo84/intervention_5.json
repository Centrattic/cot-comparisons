      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent who pays child support and has 50% custody. The kids have savings from the father's house and want to use that money to buy a desk for their room at the mother's house. The father is upset because the ex-wife receives child support but expects the kids to spend their own money on furniture there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, so the mother receiving that money should be responsible for providing essentials, including furniture. If the kids are using their own savings for items at the mother's house, that might imply she's not fulfilling her part, which is unfair. \n\nThe father might feel resentful because he's paying support and expects that money to cover such expenses. The kids have their own savings, but if the mother is in charge of the house, she should manage the environment. However, the father allowing the kids to take their savings could be seen as enabling the mother's lack of responsibility, but the father is also within his rights to be upset about the situation.\n\nEthically, the mother should handle the furniture costs since it's her responsibility as the custodial parent. The father's anger might be justified because he's already paying child support. The key is whether the mother is using the child support appropriately. If she isn't, then the father isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, he might not be the one directly at fault here; the issue is more about the mother's responsibility. \n\nSo, the author (father) isn't necessarily in the wrong for being angry. The problem lies with the mother expecting the child's savings for what should be her responsibility. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
