      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent who's upset that their ex-wife expects their children to use their savings to buy furniture for their room at the ex's house, even though the parent is paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basic facts. The author has joint custody, pays $2000 in child support, and the kids save money at his place. The son wants to use his savings to buy a desk for his room at the mother's house. The author is angry about this because he's already contributing through child support.\n\nI should start by thinking about the legal and ethical implications. Child support is typically intended to cover the child's needs, so if the ex is using the child's savings for furniture, maybe she should be covering that from her portion of the support. However, the child's savings might be personal money they earned or received as gifts. If the ex is expecting the child to use their own money for furniture, that could be seen as pushing the responsibility onto the child, which isn't fair. On the other hand, the author might be right to be upset because child support is supposed to cover those expenses.\n\nAnother angle is the custody arrangement. Since the author has 50% custody, the children live in both homes. It's possible that the ex isn't using the child support funds appropriately if she's making the kids use their own money for essentials. But the author's reaction is anger, which might come across as withholding support. The author could be in the wrong if they refuse to let the child use their savings, especially if the desk is a necessity. However, the author might not be in the wrong if they feel the child's savings should be their own to use as they see fit.\n\nI should also consider common practices. Typically, child support covers basic needs, including furniture. If the ex isn't using the support for that, it's a problem. But if the child has personal savings, maybe they can choose how to spend it. However, the author's role in allowing the child to access those savings might be part of the issue. If the author is withholding access, that could be the problem. But if the author is just being upset about the situation, not necessarily acting on it, maybe they're justified.\n\nPossible ethical considerations: The author might not be in the wrong for being upset because it's reasonable to expect that child support covers all necessary expenses. The ex might be overstepping by expecting the child to use their own money. On the flip side, the author's refusal to let the child use their savings could be seen as not supporting the child's needs, even if it's their own money.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's anger is justified. If the author is just upset but not taking harmful action, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're planning to deny the child access to their savings without justification, that's different. The key point is whether the author's reaction is appropriate given the circumstances. Since the author is still deciding whether to allow the purchase, their anger might be a valid response to the ex's expectations conflicting with the child support payments.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's anger might be justified because the ex should be covering furniture costs with child support. However, if the author refuses to let the child use their own savings, that could be seen as the author's fault. But since the author is still undecided, perhaps they're not the asshole. The answer might hinge on whether the author is acting on their anger or just being upset. Given the context, the answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the ex's actions are questionable.\n"
