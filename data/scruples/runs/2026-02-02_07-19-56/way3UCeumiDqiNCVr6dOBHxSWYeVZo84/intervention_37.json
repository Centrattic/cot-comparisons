      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a divorced parent who's upset because their ex-wife is making their kids use their own savings to buy furniture for the kids' room at her house. The parent is paying close to $2,000 in child support but feels it's unfair that the ex is making the kids use their saved money for things like a desk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and financial aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's expenses, so if the ex is using the child's personal savings for furniture, that might not be the intended use of the child support. However, the parent might have given the kids the savings as a gift or part of their personal belongings, not as part of the child support funds. \n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical angle. The parent is upset because they feel the ex is not using the child support properly. But if the child's own savings are separate from the child support, then the ex might be within her rights to let the child use their money as they see fit, especially if the furniture is for their room. However, it could also be argued that the ex should cover essentials with the child support rather than asking the child to use their own money.\n\nAnother point is the custody arrangement. Since both parents have 50% custody, the child's needs are split between two households. If the ex is expecting the child to bring personal savings from the other parent's home to their own home, that could be seen as unfair. The parent might feel that the child support is meant to cover such expenses, so the ex should handle it without involving the child's personal funds.\n\nBut wait, the child's savings are their own. If the parent gave the child an allowance or saved money for them, it's the child's to use as they want. The parent might have a right to be upset if the ex is pressuring the child to use that money, but if the child is choosing to spend their own savings, maybe that's their decision. However, the parent is upset because it's essentially the ex using the child's money, which might not be appropriate.\n\nAlso, the parent is considering whether to allow the child to use their savings from their home to buy furniture for the other home. If they say no, the child might not get the desk, but if they say yes, they're enabling the ex's behavior. The parent's frustration is about the ex not covering the costs with child support, which is her responsibility.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If the ex is supposed to use the child support for essentials, then making the child use their own money might be a problem. But if the child's savings are separate and the parent is okay with the child using them, then maybe not. However, the parent is upset because it's the ex's responsibility to provide the furniture, not the child's. The parent might be right to be upset, but the line is blurry. The key is whether the child's savings are being used for something that the ex should be covering with child support. If the ex isn't meeting her obligations, then the parent isn't in the wrong for being upset. Alternatively, if the child is using their own money, maybe the parent is being too strict.\n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because the ex should be using child support to cover the child's needs, not the child's personal funds. The parent is justified in being upset if the ex is not fulfilling her financial responsibilities.\n"
