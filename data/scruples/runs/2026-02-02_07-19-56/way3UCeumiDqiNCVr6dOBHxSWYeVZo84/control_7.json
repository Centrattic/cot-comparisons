      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody of his kids, and pays $2,000 in child support. The ex-wife is making the kids use their own saved money from the author's house to buy furniture for their room at her house. The author is upset because he's already paying child support and doesn't think the kids should have to spend their savings on essentials at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's needs, including things like food, shelter, clothing, and furniture. If the ex-wife is using the child support money for these essentials, she shouldn't also be making the kids use their personal savings. The author might be right in thinking that the child support should cover those costs.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The kids are saving their pocket money, which they might have earned from chores or gifts. If they want to use that money for something specific, like a desk, they should have the right to do so. The ex-wife's approach could be seen as putting the burden on the kids to cover costs that are her responsibility, especially since she's receiving child support. That could be unfair, especially if the author is already contributing financially.\n\nBut wait, maybe the ex-wife isn't using the child support for essentials? The author says the kids have all the essentials at his place. So maybe at her house, they don't have them, and she's expecting the kids to pay for their own things. That would be problematic because the child support is supposed to cover those costs. The author is right to be upset because he's already paying his share.\n\nAlso, from a parental responsibility standpoint, both parents should cover the child's needs. If the ex-wife is asking the kids to use their own money for furniture that should be covered by her, using the child support, that's not appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry about this. The kids' savings are their personal money, and they should be able to use it as they wish without being forced by a parent to spend it on essentials.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't the asshole here. The ex-wife is using the child support money she's receiving in a way that shifts the responsibility of providing essentials onto the kids' personal savings. The author is justified in his anger because he's already meeting his financial obligations.\n"
