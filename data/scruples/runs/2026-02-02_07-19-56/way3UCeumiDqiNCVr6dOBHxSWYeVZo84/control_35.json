      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent who has 50% custody and pays $2,000 in child support. The ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and financial aspects. The author is paying child support, which is supposed to cover the children's needs. If the ex-wife is expecting the kids to use their own money for furniture at her house, that might be a point of contention. The author is upset because they feel the child support should cover those expenses. \n\nLegally, child support is typically meant to cover everyday costs, including furnishings. If the ex isn't contributing from the child support money, the author might feel it's unfair to expect the kids to pay out of their savings. But it's also about parenting styles. The ex might be trying to teach the kids financial responsibility, though that could be seen as unfair if the support isn't being used as intended.\n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated. They might feel their ex is not using the child support appropriately. But the kids have savings from their own pocket money, which they might want to use for their needs. However, the author is in a position where they have to decide whether to let the son use the savings for something at his mother's house, which could be a point of conflict.\n\nI need to check if the author is in the wrong. If the ex is supposed to use child support for the kids' needs, then making them spend their own money on essentials might be unfair. But the author's reaction is about being angry, which is a personal feeling. The key is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Since the ex isn't using the child support for its intended purpose, the author's frustration is justified. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
