      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2000 in child support, and is upset that his ex wants the kids to use their saved money from his house to buy furniture for their mother's house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics. Child support is typically intended to cover the children's needs, so the ex receiving it but still asking the kids to use their own savings for furniture might seem conflicting. The author is paying support, which should cover essentials like furniture. If the ex is expecting the kids to use their personal savings for things that should be covered by child support, that could be problematic.\n\nBut wait, the kids have savings from the author's house. Does the author have control over how they spend that money? The kids are 10 and 9, so they might have received gifts or allowances. The author might feel that the ex shouldn't be using the child support and then also taking the kids' personal money for furniture they should provide. However, in a shared custody situation, both parents are responsible for the children's needs. If the kids don't have essentials at the ex's house, that's an issue. But if they do, maybe the ex is being inconsistent.\n\nThe author is angry because they're paying support, which should cover furniture, but the ex is making the kids use their own money. That could be seen as the ex not fulfilling her part of covering the children's needs with the support money. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about this. The ex might be misusing the child support by not using it for the intended purpose. The children's savings are their own, but using them for furniture that should be covered by the support could be unfair. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
