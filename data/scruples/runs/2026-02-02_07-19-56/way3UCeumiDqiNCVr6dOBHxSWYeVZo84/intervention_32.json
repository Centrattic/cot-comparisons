      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's ex-wife making the kids use their savings to buy furniture for her house, even though the author is paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody arrangement and financial responsibilities. The author has 50% custody and pays about $2000 in child support. The kids have a room with essentials at his place, but the son wants to use his savings to buy a desk for his room at the ex's house. The author is upset because the ex gets child support but still expects the kids to pay for furniture.\n\nChild support is supposed to cover the children's needs, including things like furniture. If the ex is receiving child support, it's reasonable to expect that she uses that money for the children's expenses. Making the kids use their own savings for something like a desk could be seen as shifting the financial responsibility from the parent to the child, which isn't appropriate. The author is right to be concerned because the child support should cover such costs. The ex's request might be taking advantage of the situation by not using the child support as intended. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about this. The answer should be B (No).\n"
