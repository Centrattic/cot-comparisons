      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody of their kids, pays $2000 in child support, and now their ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house. The author is upset because they think the ex is getting child support but still making the kids use their savings for essentials.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, including furniture. So if the ex is receiving child support, she should be responsible for providing the essentials. Making the kids use their savings for things like a desk might be seen as shifting the financial responsibility onto the children, which isn't fair.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that since they pay child support, the ex should handle those expenses. The fact that the kids have to take their savings to buy furniture could be a point of contention. The author could be right in feeling that the ex isn't fulfilling her responsibility here. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex might argue that the child support isn't enough or that she's trying to teach the kids about budgeting and saving. However, using a child's savings for necessities isn't typically considered appropriate. It could be seen as placing an undue burden on the child and not respecting the child support arrangement.\n\nI should also consider the kids' well-being. If the furniture is essential and the ex isn't providing it, that's a problem. The author might want to ensure their children have a proper living environment. The fact that the kids have essentials at the author's house but not at the ex's house could indicate a disparity in living conditions, which the author might be justified in being upset about.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author's anger could be justified if the ex is not using the child support for the child's needs. However, if the ex is facing her own financial difficulties, that's a different story. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is upset about the ex making the kids use their savings for essentials that should be covered by child support, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
