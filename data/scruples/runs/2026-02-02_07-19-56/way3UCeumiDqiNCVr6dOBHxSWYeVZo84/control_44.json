      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's ex-wife making their kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though he's paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is supposed to cover the basic needs of the children, right? So if the ex is receiving child support but still expects the kids to pay for their own furniture, that might be a problem. The author is upset because he's already paying support but she's making the kids use their own money for essentials. \n\nThe kids have savings from the author's house. If the son wants to use that money for a desk at his mom's house, does the author have a right to be angry? Well, maybe the author feels he's supporting the kids through child support, so the ex shouldn't make them spend their own money on things that should be covered by the support. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the ex is trying to teach the kids responsibility or budgeting, but that's a stretch. Essentials like furniture should be covered by the parent receiving child support. If the ex isn't using the child support for necessary items, that's a misuse of funds. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The ex should be covering those costs with the child support she receives. The kids' savings are their own, but using them for furniture that should be provided by the parent is unfair. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
