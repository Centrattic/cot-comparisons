      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his ex-wife is making their kids use their savings to buy furniture for the mother's house. The author pays $2000 in child support and has 50% custody.\n\nFirst, child support is meant to cover the children's basic needs and daily expenses. If the ex-wife is using the child support but also expecting the kids to pay for furniture from their own savings, that might be unfair. The author is frustrated because he's already covering costs through support and doesn't want the kids to have to dip into their savings for items at the other parent's home.\n\nThe kids have their own savings, but those are likely from allowances or gifts. Using that money for furniture might be seen as the ex expecting the kids to fund her household expenses. The author's anger could be justified because he's already contributing financially, and the ex isn't covering these additional costs. However, maybe the ex is trying to teach the kids about saving and responsibility, but that's a stretch. It's more about the division of financial responsibilities between the parents. Since the custody is split, each parent should cover expenses at their respective homes. The ex using child support for essentials and then making the kids pay for other items with their savings seems like a conflict in financial responsibility. So the author isn't wrong to be upset. Answer B.\n"
