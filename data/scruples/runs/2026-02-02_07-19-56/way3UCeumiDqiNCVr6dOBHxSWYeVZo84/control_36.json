      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in a situation where their ex-wife is making their kids use their savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though the author is paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and emotional aspects. The author has 50% custody and pays $2000 in child support. The kids have savings from the author's house and the son wants to use that money for a desk in his room at the ex's house. The author is upset because they feel they already cover expenses through child support.\n\nLegally, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs. If the ex is using the child's savings for furniture, that might be a red flag. The author's frustration is understandable because they're paying for the kids' upkeep but then the ex is making the kids use their own money for basics. It's about whether the ex is fulfilling her responsibility to provide essentials, which should be covered by child support. The kids' savings were likely accumulated under the author's care, so the ex shouldn't be depleting that for furniture. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset because the ex isn't using the child support as intended and is instead making the child use personal savings. The key is that the child support should cover those essentials, not the child's own money.\n"
