      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is divorced and has 50% custody of their children. They pay $2000 a month in child support to their ex. The kids have their own savings from the author's house, and the son wants to use that money to buy a desk for his room at the ex's house. The author is upset because the ex gets the child support but still expects the kids to use their savings for furniture at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is supposed to cover the child's basic needs, right? So if the ex is receiving child support, that should include things like furniture, right? But maybe the ex isn't using the child support for that. The author is paying for the kids' essentials through child support, but the ex is making the kids use their own savings for furniture at her house. That seems odd because the child support should cover those costs. The kids' savings are probably from allowance or gifts from the author, so using that money for something at the other parent's house might not be fair. \n\nAlso, the author has 50% custody. If the kids have essentials at the author's house, maybe the ex isn't maintaining the same level of furnishings at her house. It's possible the ex isn't contributing to the furniture costs and is instead making the kids use their own money. That could be the issue. The author is frustrated because they're paying child support and providing for the kids, but the ex is shifting the responsibility of buying furniture onto the children, which isn't the parents' role. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, parents are supposed to provide for their children's needs without making them use their own savings. The kids' savings are their own money, but they're minors, so their parents should manage their money responsibly. If the ex is asking the kids to use their savings for furniture, that might not be appropriate. The author is upset because they feel they're paying for everything through child support, so the other parent shouldn't expect the kids to take money from their savings for that purpose.\n\nBut maybe there's a different angle. If the kids have their own savings, they might have the right to use it as they wish, but since they're children, their parents have some authority over how it's used. However, using it for furniture at the other parent's house could be seen as imposing on the child's resources. The author might be justified in not wanting the kids to deplete their savings for that. \n\nI think the key points are that child support should cover furniture, and the ex is not fulfilling that responsibility by making the kids use their own money. The author is not wrong to be upset because the ex is expecting them to contribute beyond their responsibility. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
