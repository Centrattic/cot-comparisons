      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent with 50% custody. The ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house, even though the author pays child support.\n\nFirst, child support is meant to cover the child's basic needs, including furniture. If the ex-wife is receiving child support, it's expected that she uses it for the children's necessities. Making the kids use their own savings for essentials like a desk could be unfair. The kids' savings are their personal money, so using them for necessary items at the other parent's house might not be reasonable, especially if the child support isn't covering it.\n\nThe author is upset because they're already paying child support and don't see why the kids should have to spend their own money for necessities. It's a common issue in co-parenting situations where both parents might have different approaches. However, the key point is whether the ex-wife is using the child support appropriately. If she's not covering essentials with the support money, then she's at fault. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset because it's the ex-wife's responsibility to provide necessary items with the child support she receives. The kids' savings shouldn't be used to cover what the support is meant for. So the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
