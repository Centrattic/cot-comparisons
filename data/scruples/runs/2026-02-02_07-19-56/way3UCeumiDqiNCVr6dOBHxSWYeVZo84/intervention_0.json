      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong. The situation is about a divorced parent who's upset that his ex-wife expects their kids to use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though he's paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author has 50% custody and pays $2,000 in child support. The kids have a savings account that they built up while living with him. Now, the son wants to use that money to buy a desk for his room at his mother's house. The author is angry because he feels like the child support should cover those essentials, and he's conflicted about letting the son use his savings for that.\n\nSo, the key points are: child support covers the costs, but the ex wants the kids to use their own money for furniture at her house. The author is upset because he's already paying support but feels like the ex isn't contributing enough. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry about this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is intended to cover the child's needs, including things like furniture. If the ex is keeping the child support but then expecting the kids to pay for their own essentials, that might be a problem. However, the kids' savings are their own money. If the son wants to use his own savings to buy something, the author might have a right to let him do so, especially if it's the child's decision. But the author is upset because he feels the ex isn't using the child support properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the wrong if he's preventing the child from using their own money. The savings were earned by the kids, perhaps through allowance or gifts, and they have a right to decide how to use it. The author's frustration could be valid if the ex isn't using the child support to cover necessary items. But if the author refuses to let the son use his savings, that might be overstepping, as it's the child's money.\n\nI think the author's anger is misplaced. The ex's responsibility is to use the child support for the child's needs. If the ex is not doing that, the author might need to address that through legal channels. However, the son's savings are his own, and the author shouldn't be blocking the child from using his money if he wants. The author might be projecting his frustration onto the child's decisions. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for being angry about this specific situation, even if there's a larger issue with the ex not using the support correctly.\n"
