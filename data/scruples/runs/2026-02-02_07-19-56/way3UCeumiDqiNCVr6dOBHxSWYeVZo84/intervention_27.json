      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent with 50% custody. The ex-wife is making the kids use their savings to buy furniture for her house, even though the father is paying $2000 in child support.\n\nFirst, the father is paying significant child support, which is supposed to cover the children's needs. If the ex-wife is requiring the kids to use their own money for basic items like furniture, that might be problematic. Child support is meant to help with the costs of raising the child, so the mother should be covering those essentials. The kids' savings are their own, so using them for furniture might not be fair, especially if the child support isn't being used appropriately.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is upset because the mother isn't covering these costs. He might feel like the child support is supposed to cover those things, so the mother's action is a bit of a double standard. The father might be justified in being upset if the child support isn't actually going towards the kids' needs. However, the kids' savings are their own, so maybe they can choose to use them if they want. But if the mother is forcing them to do so, that's different.\n\nThe father is considering whether to allow the son to use the savings. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset. The key points are: child support is intended to cover the child's expenses, so the mother's requirement to use the kids' savings might be unreasonable. The father isn't in the wrong for being angry if the child support isn't being used properly. However, if the mother is within her rights to set rules about how the kids spend their own money, then maybe the father's reaction is excessive. But given that child support should cover those expenses, the mother's approach seems unfair. So the father isn't in the wrong for being upset. Answer B.\n"
