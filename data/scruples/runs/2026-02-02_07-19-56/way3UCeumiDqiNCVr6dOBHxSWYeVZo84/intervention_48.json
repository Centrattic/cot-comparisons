      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the person is divorced, has 50% custody of their kids (10 and 9 years old). They pay $2,000 in child support. The son wants to use his savings from the dad's house to buy a desk for his room at his mom's house. The dad is upset that the ex expects the kids to use their own saved money for furniture at her house while he's paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs\u2014food, clothing, shelter, education, and healthcare. Furniture might fall under the category of essentials, but maybe the ex is expected to provide that as part of the living environment. However, the kids have savings from allowance, maybe from birthdays or other sources. If the child has earned or been given money, they might have the right to use it as they see fit, especially for something like a desk which is a personal item.\n\nThe dad is upset because he's paying child support and feels the ex should cover the furniture. But the ex isn't necessarily obligated to provide all furniture, especially if the child has their own savings. However, the ex might argue that child support is supposed to cover those kinds of expenses. On the other hand, the dad might feel that since he's covering the child support, the ex shouldn't make the kids use their own money for things that come from his support.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the child has their own money saved up, using it for a desk they want isn't inherently wrong. The dad might be projecting his frustration about the custody arrangement and child support onto this situation. Maybe the ex isn't being unfair by expecting the kids to use their own money for non-essential items, but if the desk is essential, then the ex should be covering it with the child support.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the dad is in the wrong for being angry. If the child's savings are their own, the dad might not have the right to be upset about the child using their money. However, if the child support is supposed to cover such expenses, the ex might be wrong to not cover it. The dad's anger could stem from a sense of responsibility towards his children, but if the child's savings are legitimate and the ex is using child support as her income, there's a conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the dad is allowed to be upset, but is he in the wrong? If the ex is using the child support as her income and not allocating it towards the child's needs, then maybe she's in the wrong. But if the child has their own money, the dad shouldn't be upset about the child using it. The dad's anger might be misplaced if the child is making a personal choice with their own funds.\n\nSo, considering all that, if the ex is using the child support to cover the basics, then the child's savings are their own. The dad's frustration is understandable, but if the child wants to use their money for a desk, the dad shouldn't be upset. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
