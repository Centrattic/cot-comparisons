      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset that their ex wants their kids to use their savings for furniture at the ex's house.\n\nFirst, the author pays $2000 in child support and has 50% custody. The kids have their own savings, and the son wants to use that money to buy a desk at his mom's house. The author is angry because the ex gets child support but then expects the kids to use their saved money for her house.\n\nI need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically for the child's needs, so the ex is entitled to use that money as she sees fit, as it's on behalf of the child. However, the kids' savings are their own property. The ex might be pressuring the kids to use their personal savings for furniture in her house, which could be seen as not respecting the children's belongings. \n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, both parents should support the child's needs. The author has already provided essentials at their house, but the ex is now expecting the child to fund additional items from another parent's house. That might be unreasonable, especially if those items are considered the ex's responsibility. \n\nThe author's anger could stem from feeling that the ex is not contributing her share, making the child use their own money instead of using the child support for that purpose. Legally, the child's savings belong to them, and the ex can't force the child to spend it. However, if the child wants to use their savings voluntarily, maybe the author should respect that. But the ex's role in encouraging this could be the issue.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The ex is using child support and then expecting the child's personal funds for her home, which is unfair. The answer is B (No).\n"
