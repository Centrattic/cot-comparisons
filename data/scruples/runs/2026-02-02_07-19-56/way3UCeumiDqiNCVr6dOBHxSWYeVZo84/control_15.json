      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that the father is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2k in child support, and is upset because his ex-wife expects their kids to use their saved money to buy furniture at her house. The son wants to take his savings from the father's house to buy a desk for his room at the mother's house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including things like housing, food, clothing, and furniture. Since the father is paying child support, the ex-wife is legally entitled to use that money for the children's needs. However, the father is now being asked to let the kids use their personal savings (pocket money) from his house to buy furniture at the mother's house. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe father is upset because he feels like the child support should cover those expenses. The kids have essentials at his house, so maybe he's thinking that the ex should use the child support money for furniture there. But the child is asking to use his own saved money, which was earned (like pocket money) and kept at the father's house. \n\nIs it fair for the ex to expect the kids to use their personal money for things at her house? That's the crux here. Legally, the ex might be within her rights to use child support for necessary items, but the kids' personal savings are separate. If the kids have their own money, they might have the right to use it as they see fit, especially for their own benefit. However, the father might be worried that the ex isn't using the child support properly, but that's a different issue.\n\nEmotionally, the father is frustrated because he's paying support, yet the ex is making the kids use their own money for more expenses. It's possible he feels like the ex isn't covering the necessary costs with the support money she's receiving. On the other hand, the mother might argue that furniture isn't a recurring expense and that the child's savings can cover it, especially since the child is spending the furniture at her house.\n\nThe father's reaction is to be angry and not sure if he should let the kid use the money. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, he might not be in the wrong if the child's savings are separate from the child support. The ex might be expected to use the child support for essentials. But if the child has their own money from pocket money, it's a bit of a gray area. The father could argue that the ex should cover furniture with the child support, not the kids' personal funds. \n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, both parents should ensure the child's needs are met. If the mother isn't providing necessary furniture and instead redirecting the child to use their own money, that could be an issue. But if the furniture is considered a discretionary purchase, the mother might have less obligation. However, furniture is generally a necessity, so using child support should cover it. If she's not using the support money for that, she might be in the wrong, but the father is upset because he's paying the support and the kids are being made to use their own money for the same purpose.\n\nThe father's frustration might be valid if he's feeling that the child support isn't being used as intended. However, the kids' personal savings are separate, and the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting them to use their own money for their own needs, especially if they have the means. But if the child support is supposed to cover those items, the mother should be the one purchasing them. It's a bit of a complex situation where both parties might have valid points. However, the author's anger might be justified if he believes the ex isn't using the child support properly, but the kids' use of their own money isn't necessarily wrong. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could lean either way. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the mother is using the support as intended, then the father might be at fault for expecting the kids to handle it. But if the mother isn't using support for essentials, then the father is justified. Without more context, it's a bit tricky. But given the information, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
