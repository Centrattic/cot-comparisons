      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent who's upset because their ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house, even though the author pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the author is upset about. They pay $2,000 a month in child support, which presumably covers the kids' needs. The ex is asking the kids to use their personal savings to buy furniture for their room at her house. The author is angry because they feel they already cover the costs through child support, and now the ex is shifting the financial responsibility onto the kids using their own money.\n\nThe key points here are: the custody arrangement is 50%, the author pays significant child support, and the ex is making the kids use their savings for essentials. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for being upset about this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is typically intended to cover the children's basic needs, including furniture. The fact that the ex is using the child support but then expecting the kids to pay for furniture with their own savings could be seen as unfair. However, it's important to note that the kids have their own savings, which they might have earned through allowance or other means. Using personal savings to buy a desk isn't inherently wrong, but in this context, it might be seen as the ex not covering the necessary expenses that the child support is supposed to handle.\n\nThe author's frustration is reasonable because child support is meant to cover such costs. If the ex isn't using the child support for essentials, that's where the issue lies. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset because they're fulfilling their financial obligation, and it's the ex's responsibility to use that money appropriately. The fact that the kids have savings might be a red herring here; the ex should be covering the furniture costs from the child support, not expecting the children to bear that expense.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The ex is likely the one at fault for not using the child support to cover necessary items, thus shifting the burden to the children's personal funds. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
