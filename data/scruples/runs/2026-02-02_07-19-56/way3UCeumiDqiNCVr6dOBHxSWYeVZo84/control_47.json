      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody of his kids, pays $2000 in child support, and now his ex is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house. The author is upset because he's already paying child support, so he feels like the ex shouldn't also expect the kids to spend their own money on essentials there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support typically covers the basic needs of the children. Since the author has 50% custody, the support amount might be calculated based on that split. The ex receiving child support and then expecting the kids to use their savings for furniture could be seen as conflicting. The child support is supposed to help cover the costs of raising the kids, so essentials like furniture should be covered by that, not the kids' personal savings.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The kids are young, 10 and 9 years old. Making them use their saved money (which they likely earned from allowance or gifts) for necessary items in their other home might be unfair. The author is concerned about the ex's approach and is upset about it. He's not necessarily refusing to help his son, but he's questioning the ex's actions.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the ex should be responsible for providing necessary furnishings in her home. Child support payments are meant to assist with the expenses of the children in her care. If the ex is making the kids use their own money, she might not be fulfilling her part in covering the costs. The author's frustration is understandable because he's already contributing financially, and it's adding extra pressure on the kids to have to spend their savings.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction is about being \"pissed,\" which might be seen as overreacting if the intent is just for the kids to use their savings. But considering the context\u2014child support is supposed to cover these things\u2014maybe the author isn't wrong. It's also important to note that the kids are in both parents' care, so both should be responsible for the necessary expenses in their custody periods.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should handle the son's request to use his savings. If the author allows it, does that mean he's enabling the ex's behavior? If he refuses, he might be denying the kid's request, but if he allows it, he's indirectly supporting the ex's approach. The key here is that the ex shouldn't be making the kids use their money for essentials. The child support is supposed to cover that, so the author's anger is potentially justified.\n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, often when a parent uses child support to cover basic needs, it's expected that the parent uses the funds accordingly. If the parent is making the kids spend their own money on basics, that's considered wrong. Therefore, the author's frustration is valid, and he's not necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The ex's actions might be the issue here.\n"
