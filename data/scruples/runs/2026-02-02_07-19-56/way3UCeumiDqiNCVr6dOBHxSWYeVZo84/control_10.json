      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2000 child support, and his ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is upset because he's paying child support, which presumably covers the costs of raising the kids, including things like furniture. However, the ex-wife is making the kids use their own money to buy a desk for their room at her house. The author is angry about this and wonders if he's in the wrong for being upset.\n\nChild support is typically intended to cover the basic needs of the children, including housing, food, clothing, and other essentials. If the ex-wife is using the child support money to cover these costs, then perhaps she isn't wrong in expecting the kids to use their own savings for non-essential items. But if the furniture is considered an essential item, then it might be something that should be covered by the child support. \n\nHowever, the problem here is that the author is paying child support, so he might expect that the ex-wife is using that money to cover all necessary expenses for the kids. If she's making the kids use their own money for items that are necessary for their living environment (like a desk), that could be seen as unfair, especially since the child support is meant to cover those costs. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids have their own savings from pocket money, which they earned or were given. Using that for personal items might be reasonable. But the author's frustration comes from the fact that he's already paying for the kids' needs through child support, so why should they have to use their own money for furniture at the other parent's house. \n\nLegally, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, so if the ex-wife is not using the support money for that purpose, the author might have a point. However, the custody arrangement is 50%, meaning the kids are splitting their time, so maybe the responsibility is shared. But the child support is paid to the ex-wife, so she might be responsible for covering expenses when the kids are with her. \n\nBut if the furniture is needed at her house, shouldn't that be covered by her, or the child support? If the author is paying support, he might expect that the ex-wife is using that money for the kids' needs, including furniture. So making the kids use their own money for that could be seen as unfair. \n\nAlternatively, the ex-wife might argue that the child support is a general allowance and that specific items like furniture can be purchased by the child if they want. However, essential furniture like a desk might be necessary for the child's education and living conditions, so that should be covered by the parents. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author is clearly upset because he feels he's already paying for these things and doesn't want the kids to have to use their savings. The ex-wife might be in the wrong by not covering the furniture costs from the child support, but it's also possible that she's within her rights if the child support is just a general allowance. \n\nThe key here is whether the furniture is considered an essential expense that should be covered by the parent, or if it's a discretionary item. If it's essential, then the parent should cover it with child support. If it's not, then maybe the child using their own savings is acceptable. However, the author is paying support, so he might expect that the ex-wife is using that to cover all necessary expenses. \n\nAnother angle: in shared custody, sometimes each parent is responsible for certain expenses. If the author has 50% custody, maybe they split the costs. But the child support is paid to the ex-wife, so perhaps she's expected to cover the expenses when the kids are with her. If that's the case, making the kid use their own money for furniture at her house might be unfair because the child support should cover it. \n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The ex-wife might be misusing the child support by not covering necessary items and instead making the child use their savings. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
