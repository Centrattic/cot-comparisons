      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about the ex-wife making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, despite the author paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author is paying $2,000 a month in child support, which is presumably to cover the children's needs. Child support is usually intended for the general care of the kids, including essentials like food, clothing, and housing. So if the ex is asking the kids to use their own money for furniture, which is an essential item, that might be a problem because the child support should cover that.\n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The kids are 10 and 9 years old. Asking them to use their savings for furniture might be putting financial responsibility on them that they're not expected to handle. The author is upset because they're paying for the kids' essentials already, so the ex's request seems like an added burden. The author is also their parent, so they might feel it's their responsibility to provide for their children's needs, regardless of custody arrangements.\n\nAnother angle is the custody arrangement. The author has 50% custody, meaning both parents are responsible for the children's care. The ex is the one who's asking the kids to use their own money, which could be seen as not meeting their parental responsibilities. The author might be right to be upset that the child support isn't being used as intended.\n\nHowever, the author is considering allowing the son to use his savings. If they do allow it, they might be covering the furniture expense, which could be seen as going beyond what's necessary. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The ex's actions might be the issue here, not the author's reaction.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the child support is meant to cover the child's needs, so the ex should be using that money for essentials. By making the kids use their savings, the ex isn't fulfilling her part of the agreement. The author's frustration is justified because they're paying for the kids' needs, and the ex is not using the child support as intended.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex is the one who's not using the child support properly. The author's anger is a reasonable reaction to being taken advantage of. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
