      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced father with 50% custody paying $2,000 in child support. His son wants to use his savings from the father's home to buy a desk in the mother's house. The father is upset because he's already paying child support and doesn't want the kids to have to spend their own money for essentials at the mother's house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, so the mother should be responsible for providing essentials like furniture. If she's not using the child support for that, maybe she's at fault. But the father is paying support and expects it to cover those costs.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The father is angry that the mother isn't covering the furniture and is making the kids use their savings. The kids have saved money, which they might have earned through chores or gifts. The father is conflicted about letting them use that money for the mother's house, even though he's already paying support.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the mother should provide necessary items with the child support. If she's not doing that, it's on her. However, the father's anger might be justified if he feels his support isn't being used appropriately. But is it wrong for him to be upset? Maybe not. However, the kids' savings are their own, so they should have the autonomy to decide how to use them, unless there's a custody agreement preventing that.\n\nThe father's role is to support the kids, but he's already paying support. The mother's responsibility includes providing essentials at her house. If she's forcing the kids to use their own money, that's a problem. The father's reaction could stem from frustration that his support isn't being utilized as intended. But is he in the wrong for being angry? Or is he overstepping by not allowing the kid to use their savings?\n\nAlso, the father hasn't decided yet whether to let the son use his savings. That indecision might show some conflict. If he denies the son access to his savings, he's denying the child's right to manage their own money, especially if it's for a legitimate expense. However, if the mother isn't fulfilling her financial obligations, maybe the father isn't entirely wrong to be upset.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, co-parenting can be tricky. The father might feel like he's doing his part with support, and the mother isn't. But the children's savings are separate. If the father blocks the son from using his money for the desk, that could be seen as controlling. However, if the mother is not providing the essentials, the father's frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all angles, is the author in the wrong? The mother's actions might be the main issue here, but the father's reaction could be seen as justified if he's not allowing the son to use his own money for a necessary item. However, if he's just upset about the situation but hasn't acted on it, maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's withholding the money from the child, that could be different. The question is whether the father is wrong for being pissed. Since he hasn't decided yet, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the mother isn't using the child support properly, he's not entirely at fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
