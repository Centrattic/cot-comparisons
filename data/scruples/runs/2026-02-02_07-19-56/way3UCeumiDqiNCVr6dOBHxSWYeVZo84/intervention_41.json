      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in a situation where their ex-wife expects their children to use their own savings to buy furniture for the ex-wife's house.\n\nFirst, the author is divorced, has 50% custody, and pays $2,000 in child support monthly. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk at the ex's house. The author is upset because they already pay child support but the ex still wants the kids to spend their own money on essentials.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and fairness. Child support is meant to cover the child's needs. If the ex is using the child's savings for furniture, maybe she should be covering that with her share of the child support. The author might feel that they're already contributing financially and shouldn't have to subsidize the ex's household further through the kids' savings.\n\nHowever, the kids' savings are their own money, earned from allowances or other sources. The ex might be encouraging the kids to use their money for their own needs, which is a good life lesson about budgeting and responsibility. But if the furniture is a necessity that should be covered by child support, then the ex is possibly overstepping by expecting the kids to fund it with their own savings.\n\nBut here's a twist: the author is the one who allows the son to take the savings from their house. If the kids have savings, maybe they can choose how to spend it. The author is upset because they think the ex should cover these costs via child support, not the kids' savings. However, the author might be projecting their own frustration onto the child's request.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using the child's savings as a way to express dissatisfaction with the ex. But the child just wants to buy a desk for their room. The author's reaction might be about their own feelings towards the ex rather than the child's best interest. If the author denies the request, the child's needs (a desk for schoolwork) might not be met, which could be harmful.\n\nAlso, the author hasn't decided yet whether to allow the purchase. Their anger is directed at the ex for expecting the child to use savings instead of the child support funds. However, it's not clear if the child support is being used appropriately. If the ex isn't using the child support for essentials, that's a problem. But the author might not have control over how the child support is spent unless there's a court order specifying its use.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author is justified in being upset if the ex is misusing child support. But the child's savings are their own. The author shouldn't take out their frustration on the child. Instead, they might need to address the ex's use of child support funds through legal channels if necessary. The author's anger might be misplaced if the child is just trying to improve their living conditions at the other parent's house.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is with the ex, not the child. By being angry at the child for wanting to buy a desk with their own money, the author might be the one being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're upset at the child for using their own savings, not the ex for not covering the furniture costs. However, if the author's anger is directed at the ex correctly, but the question is about whether the author is the asshole, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the ex is the problem, not the author.\n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being pissed. If the author is justified in being angry at the ex, then they're not in the wrong. But if their anger is directed at the child or their own frustration is misplaced, they might be. The author's problem is with the ex's actions, but they're expressing it by being upset about the child's request. That could make them the asshole. So maybe A is correct. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the author is right to be upset with the ex, so the answer is B. But since the question is about whether the author is the asshole, and the author is directing their frustration at the child, then they are in the wrong (A). Because the child is trying to help themselves, and the author is angry about it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
