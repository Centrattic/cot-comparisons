      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where their ex-wife expects their children to use their own savings for furniture at her house, despite the author paying child support. The author is upset about this and wonders if they're the asshole (AITA) for being angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's basic needs, including housing, food, clothing, and sometimes education. However, furniture might be considered a discretionary expense. The ex-wife is asking the children to use their own saved money for furniture at her house. The author is paying child support but feels it's unfair that the ex is using the kids' savings for this purpose.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is usually determined by guidelines that consider the child's needs and the parents' financial situations. If the ex is using the child support money for essentials, that's appropriate. But if she's using it for furniture and then asking the kids to pay out of their savings, that might be crossing a line. However, the legal system might not get involved unless it's affecting the child's well-being.\n\nEmotionally, the author is upset because they feel the ex is not contributing to the child's needs at her house, which could be seen as a lack of responsibility. The kids have their own savings, maybe from allowance or gifts, and the ex is expecting them to use that for furniture. This could be a way the ex is trying to involve the kids in financial decisions, but it might also be seen as placing an unfair burden on them, especially since the parent is supposed to cover such expenses.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable. They're already paying child support, which is meant to help cover all necessary expenses at the other parent's house. If the ex is making the kids pay for furniture from their savings, it's essentially making the kids cover expenses that should be covered by the parent. This could be seen as the ex not fulfilling her parental duties regarding financial responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex might argue that the child support is for basic living expenses, and furniture is a separate expense. However, furniture is part of a child's living environment, so it's reasonable for the parent to be responsible for that. Asking the kids to pay from their savings might be a way to teach responsibility, but it's more likely that the ex is not covering the necessary costs.\n\nThe author is not the asshole here because they're standing up for what's fair. The ex is using the child support and then expecting the kids to contribute their own money for furniture, which is a parental responsibility. The author's frustration is justified because they're paying for the kids' needs and should not be expected to cover additional costs beyond their agreed child support.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
