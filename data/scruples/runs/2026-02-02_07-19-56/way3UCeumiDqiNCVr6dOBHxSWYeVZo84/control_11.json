      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody, pays $2k in child support, and their ex is making the kids use their own savings for furniture at her house. The author is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child support laws. Child support is supposed to cover the children's basic needs, like food, housing, and furniture. So if the ex is getting child support and then requiring the kids to use their personal savings for furniture, that might not be right. The child support should already cover those essentials.\n\nThen, there's the custody aspect. Both parents have 50%, so they should be sharing responsibilities equally. Making the kids use their own money for furniture at one parent's house could be seen as unfair, especially if the other parent is already contributing through child support.\n\nAlso, the kids' savings are their own money, earned from pocket money. If the ex is asking them to spend their savings on essentials that the child support should cover, that's putting the kids in a tough spot. It's not the kids' responsibility to cover the costs of their living arrangements at each parent's home.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. They're paying child support, so expecting that money to cover all necessary items at the ex's house makes sense. The ex might be misusing the child support by not covering essentials, instead expecting the kids to use their own funds.\n\nBut maybe there's a different angle. Could the ex be trying to teach the kids about budgeting or responsibility? However, essentials like furniture shouldn't be the kids' responsibility. The parents are the ones who should handle that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The ex is not using the child support as intended, and the kids shouldn't have to spend their savings on things that should be covered by the support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
