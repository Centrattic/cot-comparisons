      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user is divorced and has 50% custody of his kids, paying $2000 a month in child support. His son wants to use his savings from the user's house to buy a desk for his room at the ex-wife's house. The user is upset because the ex is getting child support but still wants the kids to use their saved money for furniture at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's needs, including furniture. The ex-wife is supposed to use the child support for the children's expenses. If she's making the kids use their own saved money for things that the child support should cover, that might be a problem. The user is paying the ex for those expenses, so if the ex isn't using it properly, the user has a right to be upset.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The kids are using their own savings, which they might have earned or received as gifts. The user might feel that since he's paying child support, the ex should cover necessary items without making the kids dip into their personal savings. On the other hand, the ex might argue that the kids have their own money and can choose to use it how they want, but if it's for essential items that the child support should cover, that's different.\n\nAlso, custody is 50-50, so the user might feel that both households should be responsible for their share of the child's needs. If the ex is expecting the kids to carry over items from the user's house to hers, maybe that's an issue of shared responsibility. The user might be justified in not wanting the kids to have to take things from his house to her house, especially if it's an ongoing expectation.\n\nAnother angle: the son is 10 years old. Using his savings to buy a desk in the other parent's home might be a decision that's up to the parents. If the user is allowing the son to use his savings, but only for his room in the ex's house, there's a conflict. The user might feel that since he's paying child support, the ex's house should be fully equipped without needing the child's personal funds.\n\nI should also consider if there's any legal obligation. In most child support cases, the money is meant to cover the child's needs, which includes furniture. If the ex is not using the child support for that, the user might have a right to question that. However, the user's anger might be misplaced if the ex is using the child support for other necessary expenses. The key here is whether the desk is an essential item that should be covered by the child support.\n\nAlso, the user is not allowing the son to buy the desk with his savings yet, but he's considering it. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for being angry about the ex expecting the child to use his savings. Since the user pays child support, the ex should be covering such expenses. The user's anger might be justified because it's part of the agreement that child support covers these items. If the ex is making the kids use their own money, that could be seen as the ex not fulfilling her part of the agreement.\n\nIn summary, the user's frustration is about the ex using the child's savings for things that the child support should cover. Legally and emotionally, the user might be right to be upset. The ex is receiving the support but not using it as intended, which shifts the responsibility to the child. The user is not in the wrong here because he's paying for these needs and shouldn't have to let the child's personal savings cover it. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
