      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong regarding their ex-wife making the kids use their own savings for furniture at her house while they receive child support.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is divorced with 50% custody, paying $2000 in child support. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk at his mother's house. The author is upset that the ex-wife takes the child support but expects the kids to use their own money for furniture there.\n\nThe author is upset because he's already paying child support, which presumably covers the children's needs, but the ex is making them spend their own money on essentials. The question is whether the author is wrong for being angry about this.\n\nI need to consider custody and child support laws. In many places, child support is intended to cover the children's basic needs. If the ex is using the child support for general expenses but still requiring the kids to pay for furniture from their own savings, that might be unreasonable. The author is contributing financially, and the ex might be overstepping by not using the child support to cover the desk.\n\nAlso, the kids are using their own money saved from the author's house. If the author allowed them to save that money, they should have the autonomy to use it as they wish, especially for necessary items like furniture. The ex's request could be seen as shifting financial responsibility onto the children, which is inappropriate.\n\nThe author's anger is about the ex not covering essentials with the child support they're receiving. It's reasonable to expect that child support covers furniture and other necessary items. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset because the ex isn't fulfilling her part of covering the children's needs with the support money. The kids shouldn't have to use their personal savings for things that the ex should be responsible for.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
