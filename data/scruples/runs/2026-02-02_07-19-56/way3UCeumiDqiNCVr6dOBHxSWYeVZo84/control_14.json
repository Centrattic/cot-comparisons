      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent with 50% custody, paying $2,000 in child support, and the ex-wife is making the kids use their saved money to buy furniture for her house.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The father gives the kids pocket money, which they've been saving. Now the son wants to use his savings to buy a desk at his mom's house. The dad is upset because he's already paying child support, but the ex is making the kids spend their own money on furniture. He's not sure if he's in the wrong for being angry about this.\n\nSo, the dad is paying child support, which is meant to cover the kids' expenses. If the ex is expecting the kids to use their savings for furniture, that might be adding on top of what the dad is already contributing. But is the dad's anger justified?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs. If the ex is making the kids spend their own money on things that should be covered by the support, that could be a problem. The dad might be right to be upset because he's already paying for their basic needs, including furniture. However, maybe the ex is trying to teach the kids responsibility by letting them buy their own furniture, but that doesn't sound fair if the child support isn't covering it.\n\nAnother angle is the custody arrangement. Since it's 50/50, the kids spend equal time at both parents' homes. If the furniture is needed at the mom's house, then the mom should cover the cost, as that's her responsibility under the custody arrangement. The dad's child support is meant to help cover expenses at both homes. If the ex is making the kids use their savings, that's shifting part of the financial burden onto the kids instead of the parent who is supposed to handle it.\n\nAlso, the kids' savings are their own money, but they might not have a lot. If the desk is an essential item, the ex should be the one to purchase it, not the child. The dad's anger is about the ex not covering necessary expenses and instead making the child spend their own money. That seems unfair because the child support is meant to facilitate the child's needs in both households.\n\nHowever, maybe the dad is being a bit too strict. He could be seen as not allowing the kids to use their money as they see fit, but if the ex is the one making the kids do this, then the problem is with the ex, not the dad. The dad is just upset about the situation and hasn't decided if he'll let the son use the money. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry about it.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at fairness and responsibility. The dad's responsibility is covered by child support, so if the ex isn't using that money for essentials, he has a right to be upset. The ex might be misusing the child support by not covering necessary items and instead making the kids spend their savings. Therefore, the dad isn't in the wrong for being angry. The answer is B.\n"
