      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a divorced parent with 50% custody, paying $2000/month in child support. His ex-wife is making their kids use their own savings to buy furniture for her house. The author is angry about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is meant to cover the children's needs, so if the ex is receiving that money but still making the kids pay for essentials like furniture, that might be a legal issue. Legally, the child support should be covering those costs. If the ex is not using the support money for the children's needs but instead making them use their own savings, that could be a violation of custody agreements or support terms.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical side. The kids are 10 and 9 years old. Using their savings for furniture in their other parent's house might be a way to teach responsibility, but it's also possible the ex is not covering basic needs, which is her responsibility. The author is frustrated because he's already paying for the children's expenses through child support, so expecting the kids to use their own money might be unfair.\n\nAlso, the custody arrangement is 50%, so both parents are responsible for the children's care. If the ex is making the kids pay for furniture, it could indicate that she's not fulfilling her part of the financial responsibility. The author is within his rights to be upset because the child support is supposed to cover these things. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the ex is trying to teach the kids about budgeting and responsibility. However, at that age, it's more about meeting their needs. Furniture is an essential item for a living space, so it should be covered by the parent who is in charge of that environment. \n\nAnother angle: The author might have agreed to certain terms in the divorce settlement. If the agreement states that each parent covers expenses at their house, then maybe the author is expected to buy furniture for his own home, and the ex for hers. But the issue here is that the ex is making the kids use their personal savings instead of using her own money or the child support. \n\nIn most cases, child support is intended to cover the child's needs, including furniture. The parent receiving support should be responsible for those costs without making the children pay from their own savings, which were likely given to them by the paying parent as pocket money. That could be seen as misusing the child support funds. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The ex might be the one at fault here for not covering the furniture costs with her share of the child support. The author's anger stems from the ex not fulfilling her financial responsibilities, which are presumably covered by the support he's paying.\n"
