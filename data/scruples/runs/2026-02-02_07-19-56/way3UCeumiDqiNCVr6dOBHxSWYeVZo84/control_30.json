      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their ex-wife makes the kids use their savings to buy furniture at her house, while the author is paying child support. The situation involves custody, child support, and the division of responsibilities for the kids' needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is typically intended to cover the children's basic needs like food, shelter, clothing, education, and healthcare. If the ex-wife is using the child support for these essentials, then she's within her rights. However, if she's not covering essentials and instead expects the kids to pay for furniture, that might be a different story. The author mentions that the kids have \"all the essentials\" at his place, so maybe the furniture at the ex's house is considered non-essential or luxury items.\n\nNext, the emotional side. The author is angry because they're paying child support but the ex isn't covering these additional expenses. The kids have their own savings, so they might have the money to buy the furniture themselves. But the key issue is whether the ex is obligating the kids to use their savings for things that should be covered by the support. If the furniture is necessary for the child's well-being (like a desk for studying), then the ex should cover that from her portion of the support. If it's a personal choice (like a fancy desk), then maybe the child can use their savings, but the ex shouldn't be forcing them to do so.\n\nAlso, the custody arrangement is 50-50. Both parents should be responsible for the children's needs when they are in their care. If the author's house has all the essentials, maybe the ex is not fulfilling her end of covering the necessary items when the kids are with her. That could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They're paying support but feel the ex isn't contributing adequately when the kids are with her. However, the author is considering whether to allow the child to use their savings, which might not be the best approach. The child's savings are their own, and while it's their choice to spend it, the parent shouldn't be pressuring the child to do so if it's something that should be the parent's responsibility.\n\nLegally, if the ex is using child support properly and the furniture is an extra, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. But if the furniture is essential, the ex might be in the wrong for not covering it. The answer hinges on whether the furniture is a necessary item or an elective purchase. Since the author mentions \"essential kids items,\" maybe the desk is considered necessary, so the ex should be covering that from the child support rather than making the child pay from savings. In that case, the author's anger is justified, and the ex might be the one at fault. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
