      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody, and pays $2000 in child support. His son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk for his room at the ex-wife's house. The author is upset that the ex is getting child support but still expects the kids to use their saved money for furniture at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and financial aspects. Child support is typically intended to cover the child's basic needs like food, shelter, education, and healthcare. It's a legal obligation, and the custodial parent is supposed to use it for the child's benefit. However, the ex-wife is now asking the kids to use their own savings for furniture, which might be considered an extra expense. The author is frustrated because the child support is already being paid, so he feels the ex isn't using that money for essentials, hence making the kids use their own savings for something that should be covered by the support.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author is justified in feeling upset. If the ex is using the child support for non-essentials and then expecting the kids to pay for furniture out of their own money, that could be seen as unfair. The children have their savings from the author's house, which might have been earned through allowances or gifts, and the ex is now asking to take that money for items at her house. This could create a financial burden on the children and might not be the best approach for their well-being.\n\nHowever, the author's response is to be angry and unsure whether to allow the purchase. The key point is whether the ex-wife is within her rights to expect the children to use their own money for furniture. If the child support is meant to cover furniture as an essential item, then the ex should cover it from her portion. If not, maybe it's reasonable for the children to use their savings. But given that the child support is already being paid, the ex should be responsible for such expenses.\n\nAnother angle is the custody arrangement. Since it's 50% custody, the children are in both parents' homes equally. The essentials at the author's house are already covered, so perhaps the ex is not meeting her end by not covering the desk from the child support. The author's frustration is about the ex not using the child support appropriately, leading to the kids having to spend their own money.\n\nIn terms of parenting style, it's important to consider the child's needs. A desk might be necessary for schoolwork, so the ex should cover that from her child support. Making the child use their savings might not be fair if the ex is already receiving that support. The author's anger is about the ex's misuse of child support and the financial pressure on the child.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for being upset because the ex is not using child support to cover essentials and is instead expecting the kids to use their own savings. The author is protecting the child's financial resources and questioning the ex's responsibility in covering necessary expenses. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
