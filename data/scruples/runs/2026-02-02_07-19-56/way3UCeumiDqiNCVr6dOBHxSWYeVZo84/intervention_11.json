      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a divorced parent who's giving their kids a desk from their savings to use at their ex's house. The author is upset because they pay child support but the ex makes the kids use their own money for furniture there.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has 50% custody, pays $2000/month in child support. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk for his room at the ex's house. The author is angry that the ex takes the child support but still expects the kids to pay for furniture they saved at the author's place.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. They want to know if the answer is A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nChild support is supposed to cover the child's needs, including furniture. If the ex is receiving child support, she should be using that money to provide essentials like furniture. If she's making the kids use their own savings for that, it might be unfair. The author's frustration is about the ex not fulfilling her part with the child support, making the kids pay twice.\n\nBut maybe the kids have their own money from allowance or savings. The author is being asked if it's okay to let the son use his savings. The author is conflicted about allowing this. The issue is whether it's wrong to be upset about the ex expecting the kids to use their own money for furniture when she's already receiving child support.\n\nLegally, child support is supposed to cover the child's living expenses. If the ex isn't using that money for necessary items, she might be at fault. The author's anger is about the ex's actions, not the kids. The author might be right to be upset because it's the ex's responsibility to provide furniture with the support money. However, the author could also consider that the kids have their own savings and maybe it's okay for them to use it for their needs, but the ex shouldn't be making them do that when she's supposed to cover it.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (author not in the wrong) because the ex is the one receiving the support and should handle the expenses, not the kids. The author's frustration is justified as they're paying and the ex isn't meeting her responsibility. However, there's a nuance where the kids might have their own money to use as they wish, but the ex shouldn't be using the child support to avoid her responsibilities. The author isn't wrong for being angry about this situation.\n"
