      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry that his ex-wife is making their kids use their saved money for furniture at her house, even though he's paying child support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider child support laws. Typically, child support is meant to cover the child's needs, including furniture and essentials. If the ex-wife is receiving child support, she should be responsible for providing necessary items like furniture. Making the kids use their own savings for that might be unreasonable.\n\nNext, the kids' age is 10 and 9. They might have savings from gifts or allowance. But using that money for furniture at the ex's house could be seen as taking away their personal funds. The father might feel it's unfair because he's already covering expenses through child support.\n\nAlso, the custody is 50%, so both parents should be equally responsible for the children's needs. If the ex expects the kids to use their own money for furniture, it could be a sign of financial mismanagement or trying to shift responsibility onto the father without proper communication.\n\nHowever, maybe the father has a duty to support the kids in both homes. But if the child support is already covering those costs, requiring the kids to pay again could be a problem. The father's anger might be justified because he's already meeting his financial obligations, and the ex isn't using that money as intended.\n\nI should check if there are any legal implications here. If the ex is using the child support funds for other purposes and making the kids pay for essentials, that's not appropriate. Child support is supposed to cover those necessities. So the father isn't in the wrong for being upset. The ex might be misusing the child support, and expecting the kids to use their savings for furniture is placing an unfair burden on them.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in his anger because the ex should be using child support for essentials, not making the kids use their own money. The father's responsibility is met with child support, and the ex's actions are inappropriate.\n"
