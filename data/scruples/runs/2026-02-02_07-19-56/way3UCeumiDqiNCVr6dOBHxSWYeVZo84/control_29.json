      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about divorced parents and their kids' furniture. The author is a father with 50% custody, paying $2000/month in child support. His son wants to use his own savings to buy a desk at his mom's house.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because his ex-wife is getting child support but still expects the kids to use their saved money for furniture at her house. He's not sure if he should let the son do that. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry about this.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Child support is supposed to cover the kids' needs, right? So if the ex is getting that support, maybe she's supposed to cover things like furniture. But the kids have their own savings, which they might have earned from allowances or other sources. If the son wants to use his own money for something at his mom's house, is that the ex's responsibility to buy it, or should the kid contribute? \n\nThe author might feel that since he's paying child support, the ex should handle all the expenses, including furniture. But sometimes, parents might encourage kids to save and use their own money for bigger purchases as a lesson in responsibility. However, if the furniture is essential, it's debatable whether it's the kid's responsibility to pay for it. \n\nAlso, the kids have essentials at the author's house, but not at the mother's. If the ex is the one responsible for providing the furniture at her house, maybe she should cover it. The kids' savings could be their own money, but using it for something at the mother's house might be seen as the ex not fulfilling her part of the custody responsibilities. \n\nBut then again, maybe the ex is trying to teach the kids about budgeting and saving. The conflict here is about expectations. The author might feel that child support covers all the costs, so the ex shouldn't expect the kids to pay for things out of their own savings. On the other hand, the ex might think that the kids should contribute to their own needs, especially if they have savings. \n\nI think the key point is whether the furniture purchase is an essential expense that should be covered by child support. If the desk is necessary for the child's well-being (like for homework), the ex should cover it. The author might be justified in being upset because the ex is shifting that financial responsibility to the child. \n\nSo, the author's anger stems from the ex using child support as her main source of funding but expecting the kids to pay for personal items. That seems unfair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. The answer should be B (No).\n"
