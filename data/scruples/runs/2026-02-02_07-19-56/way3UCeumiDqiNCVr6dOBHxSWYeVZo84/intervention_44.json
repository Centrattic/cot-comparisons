      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a divorced parent who's upset because their ex-wife is making their kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though the author is paying child support. The author is considering whether they're the asshole for being angry about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and emotional aspects here. Child support is typically meant to cover the basic needs of the children, like food, clothing, housing, and other necessary expenses. If the ex is asking the kids to use their own money for furniture, maybe she's supposed to cover that part of the expenses with the child support she's receiving. The author might feel that since they're already paying support, the ex should handle those costs without making the kids dip into their savings. \n\nBut on the other hand, the kids have their own savings from allowances or gifts, which they might want to use for personal purchases. If the ex is making them use their money for furniture, maybe she's not providing the necessary furnishings, which could be part of her responsibility as the custodial parent. However, the line between essentials and personal items can be blurry. Desks might be considered necessary for homework, but maybe the ex already has basics covered. The author's frustration could stem from feeling that the child support isn't being used properly, leading to a financial burden on the kids.\n\nLegally, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, so the ex might be expected to cover furniture with the support money. If she's making the kids use their own money, that could shift the responsibility onto the kids, which might not be fair. However, the kids might have the right to spend their own savings as they see fit, unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. The author might be in the wrong if he's withholding permission for the child to use their own money, but if the ex is not providing necessary items, maybe the author isn't the asshole here.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the child might feel caught in the middle between parents. The author's anger could affect the child's relationship with both parents. The ex might be trying to teach the kids about responsibility by letting them purchase their own furniture, but if it's beyond their means, that could be problematic. The key is whether the ex is using the child support appropriately or if the author is justified in being upset that the support isn't covering essentials. \n\nIn conclusion, if the furniture is an essential item that the ex should cover with child support, then the ex might be at fault. But if the desk is a personal choice, the child's savings could be their own to spend. The author's anger might be valid if the ex isn't using support funds correctly, but if the ex is within her rights, the author could be overreacting. Since the author is considering whether they're the asshole, the answer might depend on the specific circumstances and local laws regarding child support allocation.\n"
