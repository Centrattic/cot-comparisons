      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong because their ex-wife is making the kids use their savings to buy furniture for her house, even though the author pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has 50% custody, pays $2000 in child support, and the kids have essentials at his place. The son wants to use his savings from the author's house to buy a desk at the ex's house. The author is upset because they're already paying child support and don't think the ex should expect the kids to pay extra for furniture.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Let me consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child support is typically supposed to cover the child's basic needs, including housing, food, and maybe some personal items. If the ex is making the kids use their own money for furniture, that might not be fair because the child support should cover those expenses. However, the kids have their own savings, so maybe they're using their own money, which is different.\n\nBut wait, the kids are minors. Do they have the right to use their savings as they see fit? The author might be the one who gave them the savings, so maybe he has some say in how it's spent. However, if the kids are allowed to use their savings for their needs, like a desk, that might be reasonable. But if the ex is forcing them to use their own money for things that should be covered by the child support, that's a problem.\n\nLegally, child support is meant to cover the child's expenses regardless of where they're staying. If the ex isn't using the child support to furnish the home, then she's not fulfilling her responsibility. The author is right to be upset because the child support is supposed to cover those costs. Allowing the kids to use their savings for essentials that should be covered by child support is unfair. \n\nAlso, the kids have a 50% custody arrangement, so both parents should be responsible for providing necessary items. The ex is using her own child support money and then expecting the kids to buy furniture from their savings. That seems like a double standard. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry about this situation. He's paying his share, and the ex isn't meeting her end by providing the necessary furnishings. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The ex should be responsible for furnishing the home with essentials using the child support money, not making the kids use their own savings.\n"
