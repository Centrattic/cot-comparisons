      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's ex-wife not providing furniture for their kids at her house, even though the author pays child support. The kids have saved money from the author's house to buy a desk for their room at the ex's house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's expenses, including things like food, clothing, and housing. If the ex-wife is receiving child support, she's expected to use those funds for the children's needs. Requiring the kids to use their own saved money for essentials at her house might not be appropriate. The author is upset because they're paying support but the ex isn't using it for what it's intended. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the ex is using the child support and then making the kids use their own money for furniture, that could be seen as a conflict of interest. The child support is supposed to cover those expenses. The author might be right to feel that the ex is not fulfilling her part, hence the frustration.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the kids' savings. If the money was a gift from the author, then the kids might have the right to use it as they see fit, provided it's their own. But if the author gave the money with the understanding that it's for their care, maybe the ex is overstepping by not allowing the kids to use it for their needs at her house.\n\nBut considering the custody is split 50-50, both parents are responsible for the children's well-being. The ex might be making the kids use their own money to teach financial responsibility, but that could be seen as shifting the burden onto the children rather than the parent. The key here is whether the ex is using the child support appropriately. If the ex isn't providing the necessary items and the child support isn't being used for that, the author has a valid point in being upset. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being angry. The ex's actions could be seen as improper use of the child support arrangement. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
