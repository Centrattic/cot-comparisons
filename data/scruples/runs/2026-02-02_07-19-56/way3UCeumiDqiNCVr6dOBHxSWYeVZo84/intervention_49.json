      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is divorced, has 50% custody of his kids, and pays $2000/month in child support. His son wants to use his savings from the dad's house to buy a desk for his room at the mom's house. The dad is upset that the ex-wife expects the kids to use their saved money for essentials at her home, even though he's paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child support is typically intended to cover the child's needs, including furniture. If the ex-wife is receiving child support, it's reasonable to expect that she uses those funds for the children's necessities. However, the kids have their own savings, which they might want to use for personal purchases. The dad is frustrated because he's already paying support but still feels like the ex is making the kids spend their own money on things that should be covered by child support.\n\nFrom the dad's perspective, he's contributing financially, so he might feel it's unfair that the ex isn't using that support for all the essentials, including furniture. The kids' savings are their own, but using them for a desk at the other parent's home could be seen as the ex not covering necessary expenses. However, the kids might want to use their money for something they personally want, which is their right. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife might be using the child support for other expenses, and the furniture isn't considered essential at her house. The dad might not have agreed to cover all furniture costs, especially at the ex's home. The question is whether it's the dad's responsibility to provide furniture for the kids at the other parent's house when he has 50% custody. \n\nLegally, child support is supposed to cover the child's needs, which would include furniture. If the ex isn't covering it, maybe the dad is within his rights to be upset. But if the agreement was that each parent is responsible for their own home's furnishings, then the dad might not be in the wrong. The key here is understanding the custody agreement and how child support is allocated. \n\nThe dad's anger might stem from feeling that the ex isn't fulfilling her part of the agreement, using his support money and now expecting the kids to use their savings. However, allowing the son to use his own savings for a desk isn't necessarily wrong, as it's his money. The dad's frustration is about the ex not covering essentials, but he might be overstepping by being angry at the child using personal funds. \n\nAlternatively, the dad could be in the right if he's not responsible for furnishing the other parent's home. The ex's responsibility, with the child support, should cover those costs. The dad isn't the asshole if he's standing up for the fact that essentials should be covered by support, not the kids' savings. \n\nSo, considering all angles, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong. He's rightfully upset that the ex isn't covering necessary expenses with the child support, and the use of the kids' savings for that might not be appropriate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
