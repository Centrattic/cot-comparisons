      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-wife is making the kids use their own savings to buy furniture for their room at her house, even though the author is paying child support and has 50% custody.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's needs, so if the ex is getting that money but still expecting the kids to use their personal savings for furniture, that might be conflicting. Legally, the custodial parent is supposed to handle the child's expenses, but the non-custodial parent here is paying support. However, the kids' savings are their own, right? So maybe the ex isn't wrong in using the kids' money for their needs, but the author might feel it's unfair because he's already paying support.\n\nThen there's the custody aspect. Since it's 50-50, the kids probably spend significant time at both homes. The author has provided essentials at his house, but the ex's house might not have the same. The kids saving money to buy furniture might be a way for them to personalize their space, which is a common childhood thing. But the author is upset because he's already covering the support and doesn't see why the kids should have to use their own money for that.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged because he's paying support but the ex isn't covering the furniture. The ex might believe that the child's savings are their own to use as they see fit. The kids might want to use their money for their room, but the author sees it as the ex not doing her part. \n\nI should also consider if there are any legal guidelines about using child support funds versus personal savings. Typically, child support is for general needs like food, clothing, shelter, but maybe not for furniture. If the ex is using the child's savings for furniture, that's their own money, so maybe the author is being a bit too strict. But he's already paying support, so expecting the ex to handle furniture expenses without using the child's savings could be reasonable. \n\nAnother angle: the author is frustrated because the ex is making the kids use their own money for something that should be covered by the custodial parent. Since the ex is the one receiving child support, perhaps she should be the one providing furniture. The author's anger might be justified if he feels the ex is not fulfilling her responsibility. \n\nBut wait, the kids have savings from their own earnings (pocket money). The ex isn't taking money from the child support, which is separate. The child's savings are their own, so maybe it's okay for the kids to use that for their needs. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset, because ideally, the ex should be covering those expenses with the child support. However, the kids have the right to use their own money as they choose. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's angry because the ex isn't covering furniture with the child support, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's taking the kids' money without their consent, that's different. But in this case, the son is asking to use his own savings. The author is just considering whether to allow it. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe the ex is within her rights to let the kids use their own money. \n\nI think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's justified in being upset because the ex should be using the child support to cover necessary items, not the kids' savings. However, the kids have the right to use their own money if they choose. So the author isn't wrong to be angry, but the ex might not be wrong either. The key is whether the child support is supposed to cover furniture. If it is, then the ex should provide it without using the kids' money. Since the author is paying support, expecting the ex to handle those costs makes sense, so he's not in the wrong for being upset.\n"
