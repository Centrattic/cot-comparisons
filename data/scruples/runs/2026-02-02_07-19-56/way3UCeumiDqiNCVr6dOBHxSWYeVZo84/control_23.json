      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the ex-wife making the kids use their savings to buy furniture for her house, even though he's paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to cover the child's needs, right? So if the ex is receiving child support, she should be using that money for the kids' essentials, including furniture. The kids' savings are their own money, earned from maybe gifts or allowance. The author is upset because he's already paying child support, and now the ex is expecting the kids to spend their personal savings on furniture at her house.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel that his child support should cover all necessary expenses. If the ex is using the child support for some things but then expecting the kids to pay for others, that could be seen as unfair. However, the kids have their own savings, which they might want to use for personal items. The question is whether it's right for the ex to require them to use their own money for furniture in her house.\n\nI should also consider custody arrangements. Since the author has 50% custody, the kids are split time between both parents. The ex might be responsible for maintaining the house where the kids stay with her. But if the furniture is essential and already covered by child support, then making the kids pay from their savings could be seen as the ex not using the child support properly.\n\nLegally, the ex is supposed to use child support for the child's needs. If the furniture is necessary, the ex should handle that from the child support. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset because his money is already going towards these needs. The kids' savings are separate, and using them for furniture at the other parent's house might not be appropriate if the child support is supposed to cover that.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the ex should be using child support for essentials, not the kids' savings. The author is justified in being upset that his child support isn't covering those costs, and the ex might be misusing the situation.\n"
