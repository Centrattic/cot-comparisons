      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is a divorced dad with 50% custody, paying $2000/month in child support. His son wants to use his savings from the dad's house to buy a desk for his room at the ex-wife's house. The dad is upset because he's already paying child support but the ex expects the kids to use their own money for furniture at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support typically covers the basic needs of the children. If the ex-wife is asking the kids to use their own money for furniture, which is a necessary item, maybe she's not contributing appropriately. But maybe the mom is within her rights to ask them to buy their own furniture. However, the kid is using his own savings, so maybe it's okay if the dad allows it. But the dad is upset because he feels the child support should cover that.\n\nThen, the ethical side. The dad is providing support, but the ex is making the kids use their own money for furniture. That could be seen as unfair. The dad is angry because he's already contributing through child support. However, the kid's savings are their own, so maybe the dad shouldn't be angry if the kid wants to use them. But if the mom is expecting the kids to bring their own money for furniture, that might be seen as placing an unfair burden, especially since the dad already supports them.\n\nAlso, the custody arrangement is 50-50, so both households should be responsible for the children's needs. If the mom isn't providing the necessary furniture, maybe she's not fulfilling her part. The dad's anger might stem from feeling that his support isn't enough, and the mom is shifting the responsibility onto the kids' savings.\n\nBut the key here is whether the dad is in the wrong. If he's angry about the ex expecting the kids to use their own money for furniture, which is a basic necessity, then maybe he's not wrong. However, if the mom is within her rights to expect the kids to contribute, then maybe he is. But in a 50-50 custody arrangement, both parents should be responsible for the children's needs in their home. If the mom isn't providing the furniture, perhaps she should be the one to cover it, not the kids. Therefore, the dad's frustration is justified because he's already paying child support, which should cover such expenses. Allowing the kid to use his savings might be acceptable, but the mom's approach could be seen as improper.\n"
