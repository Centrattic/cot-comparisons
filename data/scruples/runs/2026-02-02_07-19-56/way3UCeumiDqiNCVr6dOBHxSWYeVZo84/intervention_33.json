      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is divorced, has 50% custody of his kids, pays $2,000 in child support, and is upset that his ex expects the kids to use their savings from his house to buy furniture for their room at their mom's house.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex is getting child support from the father, which is supposed to cover the kids' expenses. But the ex is making the kids use their own saved money (which they saved at the father's house) to buy furniture at her house. The father is angry because he feels the child support should already cover that, and he's frustrated that his ex isn't using the child support for these items.\n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? Well, child support is meant to help with the children's needs, including furniture. If the ex is using the child support for other things and then expecting the kids to use their savings (which they earned from the father's pocket money) to buy furniture, that seems a bit off. The father might be justified in being upset because he's paying for the kids' needs through child support and then also supporting their savings, only for the ex to not use her portion of the support for that purpose.\n\nHowever, the kids have their own savings, which they might have earned through allowance or other means. The father might feel that once the money is given to the kids, they can use it as they see fit. But if the ex is making them use that money for her house's furniture, maybe she's not contributing her share, expecting the kids to cover it. On the other hand, the father could be overstepping if he's not allowing the kids to use their own money for their own needs, especially since they live part-time with their mom.\n\nBut the crux here is whether it's reasonable for the ex to expect the kids to use their savings for her house's furniture when the child support is supposed to cover those expenses. If the child support isn't being used for essentials, the father might have a valid point. However, if the ex is using child support for other things and the furniture is an additional expense, maybe the father isn't in the wrong to be upset. The key issue is whether the ex is using the child support appropriately and if the furniture purchase is a necessary expense that should be covered by the support. If the ex isn't using the support for that, then the father's anger is justified.\n\nIn terms of the father's decision to let the son use the savings, if he denies it, he might be protecting his money, but if he allows it, he's supporting the kid's need. However, since the ex is the primary parent at that house, she should be responsible for such purchases. The father's frustration stems from the fact that he's paying for everything through child support, and the ex isn't covering these expenses, making him feel like he's subsidizing her household.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author (father) isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The ex might be misusing the child support, and expecting the kids to contribute their savings adds insult to injury. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
