One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not reacting as expected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was part of a group where their friend Momoe came out as asexual. The author's crush and another friend were supportive. The author, however, didn't engage much, stayed quiet, and when asked, said they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them. Momoe got angry and called the author a bigot. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. Let's break down the elements. \n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's not a choice, according to most understanding. The author's confusion about whether it's a choice or not might stem from a lack of knowledge. The author's response was to remain neutral, staying quiet and not showing interest. When asked, the author gave a dismissive answer, which hurt Momoe's feelings.\n\nNow, considering social dynamics, when someone shares a personal identity, especially one related to sexuality, the expected response is usually support and acknowledgment, even if you don't fully understand. The author's response of indifference could be seen as dismissive or lacking empathy. Even if the author doesn't have strong feelings either way, not engaging or showing support can be hurtful, especially if it's a friend who is opening up.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But in friendships, emotional support is important. Not engaging might not affect the author directly, but it affects the friend's feelings of acceptance. The author's statement \"you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me\" might come off as uncaring or not validating Momoe's feelings. \n\nIt's possible the author didn't intend harm, but their actions and words did cause hurt. The key here is about respect for someone's identity and showing support, which is a social norm. Even if the author doesn't agree or care, the way they responded was inappropriate. So, the author is in the wrong because they failed to offer the support and respect their friend needed, even if they didn't mean to.\n"
