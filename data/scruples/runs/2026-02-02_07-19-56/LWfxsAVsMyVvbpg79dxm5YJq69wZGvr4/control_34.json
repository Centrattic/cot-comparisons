One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was part of a group where a friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The other friends, including the crush, were supportive. The author didn't really understand what asexuality meant\u2014whether it's just choosing not to have sex or not feeling sexual urges. They didn't believe Momoe's claim about not having urges. The author stayed quiet, didn't show interest, and when asked, said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author didn't show support, which might be seen as dismissive. Asexuality is a valid orientation, so not respecting someone's identity could be problematic. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them might come off as indifferent or not valuing Momoe's feelings. Even if the author didn't have intent to hurt, the impact was negative. Also, the author's lack of effort to understand asexuality shows a lack of awareness or empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't mocking or hostile; they remained neutral. They might not have known the right way to respond. However, in friend groups, showing support is important. The author's silence and indifferent comment could be hurtful. Being a bigot typically implies prejudice, but the author didn't express hate, just apathy. However, not standing up for a friend when others are supportive can create division.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's expected to be respectful and supportive of a friend's identity, even if you don't understand it. The author's approach was to stay out of it, which isn't inherently wrong, but their reaction could be seen as not respecting Momoe's experience. The key issue here is the lack of empathy and support, which can harm relationships. So, while the author didn't commit a malicious act, their indifference in a situation where others were supportive might make them partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
