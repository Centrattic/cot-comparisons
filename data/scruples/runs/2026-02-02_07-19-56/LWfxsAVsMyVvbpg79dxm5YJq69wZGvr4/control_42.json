One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not responding in a supportive way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was sitting with a group of friends to get closer to a crush. One friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The crush and others immediately support her. The author, however, is unsure about the definition of asexuality and doesn't believe Momoe doesn't have sexual urges. The author chooses to stay quiet, thinking it's not their place to comment. When asked, the author says they don't care unless it affects them, which makes Momoe angry and accuses them of being a bigot.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Asexuality is about not experiencing sexual attraction. It's a valid orientation. The author's lack of support might be seen as dismissive. Even if the author didn't know the exact definition, responding with indifference when asked directly could be hurtful. Also, the author's statement that they don't care unless it affects them could be perceived as not valuing Momoe's identity. Even if the author didn't express judgment, not showing support when others are being supportive can be seen as lacking empathy. The key issue is how the author's response made Momoe feel, leading to her feeling accused of bigotry. The author's actions might have been inconsiderate, even if they weren't actively criticizing. So, the answer might be A (Yes) because the author's indifference, especially in a moment when support is expected, could be seen as wrong.\n"
