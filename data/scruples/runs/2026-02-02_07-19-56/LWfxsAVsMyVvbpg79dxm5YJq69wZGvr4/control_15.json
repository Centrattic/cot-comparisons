One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. The situation involves the author being part of a group where a friend, Momoe, announces her asexuality. The author didn't react and when asked, said they wouldn't care unless it affects them, which led to Momoe getting angry and calling them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality entails. Asexual people typically experience little or no sexual attraction. It's a valid orientation, and coming out about it is a personal choice. The key here is the author's response. The author claims they don't believe Momoe doesn't have sexual urges, which might stem from a lack of understanding or misconceptions about asexuality. They also state they stayed quiet because they thought it wasn't their place to comment and didn't want to interfere unless it affected them.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. When someone shares a personal aspect of their identity, especially something like sexual orientation, the appropriate response is to listen, validate, and offer support. The author's response of \"you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me\" could be seen as dismissive. It might imply indifference or a lack of empathy, which can be hurtful even if the author didn't intend to be.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't get involved. However, in social contexts, especially among friends, supporting each other's identities is important regardless of personal impact. The author's belief that they don't need to engage unless it affects them directly might be seen as not taking the friend's experience seriously.\n\nMomoe's reaction of anger and calling the author a bigot suggests that the author's response was offensive. The term \"bigot\" is strong and implies prejudice, which the author might not have intended. However, the way the author phrased their response could be interpreted as not respecting Momoe's identity, even if they didn't mean to be harsh.\n\nIt's also important to note the author's initial reason for sitting with the group was to get closer to their crush, which might have influenced their approach to the situation. If the author wasn't fully invested in building a genuine friendship with Momoe, their reaction might be more about personal disinterest than ignorance of the issue.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's identity is a fundamental aspect of being a good friend. The author's response, while perhaps not intentionally harmful, could still be damaging because it didn't acknowledge Momoe's feelings or the significance of her coming out. The author's lack of empathy and dismissive attitude could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they didn't act out of malice.\n\nHowever, the author might not have malicious intent. They might simply lack understanding of asexuality and how to respond appropriately. But in such situations, being open to learning and showing respect is crucial. The author's choice to remain silent and then give a neutral, almost indifferent response might not meet the social expectation of support in this context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have ill intentions, their actions and words could be deemed inconsiderate and hurtful, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong.\n"
