One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend coming out as asexual, and the author not responding in a supportive way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality actually means. From what I remember, asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction to others. It's not about choosing not to have sex, but rather not feeling sexual desire. So when the author's friend Momoe said she was asexual, she might have been explaining her lack of sexual attraction, not just a decision to abstain from sex.\n\nThe author mentions they didn't believe that asexual people don't feel sexual urges. That could be a misunderstanding. The key here is that the author didn't support or acknowledge Momoe's identity when she came out. Instead, they stayed quiet and then gave a dismissive response when asked. The author's reasoning was that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But that's not a good approach when it comes to someone's identity and personal experience.\n\nWhen Momoe asked what the author thought, the response was that they don't care unless it affects them. That's pretty cold and dismissive. It's not about whether it affects the author personally but about respecting Momoe's identity. The author's lack of empathy here is problematic. Even if they don't fully understand or believe Momoe's experience, they should still validate her feelings and support her.\n\nThe author's position that they don't care unless it affects them is similar to saying, \"Your identity doesn't matter to me unless it impacts my life.\" That's not a supportive stance in a friendship. Friends should be there to listen and support each other, especially when someone is sharing something personal and important.\n\nAlso, the author's belief that they shouldn't comment unless it's their place might be a way to avoid engaging with topics they don't understand. But in friendships, it's important to be open and show support even if you're not fully informed. The author's response came off as indifferent and possibly judgmental, which led Momoe to feel disrespected.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions and response were hurtful and dismissive. They didn't support their friend during a vulnerable moment, which makes them at fault. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
