One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was part of a group where their crush and another friend immediately supported Momoe when she came out as asexual. The author, however, didn't say much, stayed quiet, and when asked, responded that they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. The author now wonders if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, what's the issue here? The key points are the author's reaction and the friend's feelings. Asexuality is about not experiencing sexual attraction. The author seems skeptical about Momoe not having sexual urges, which might come off as dismissive. Even though the author says they don't want to interfere unless it affects them, their response was dismissive and maybe even condescending. \n\nComing out is a personal and vulnerable moment. The author's nonchalant attitude could be seen as insensitive. Even if they didn't want to express an opinion, the way they phrased their response (\"you can do what you want unless it affects me\") might make Momoe feel invalidated. The author's skepticism about asexuality itself (\"don't believe that\") probably contributed to Momoe's anger. \n\nIn social situations, even if you don't share the same views or don't want to comment, the way you respond matters. The author's approach here seems to lack empathy and understanding, which can hurt the friend's feelings. So, yes, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
