One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. The situation is that the author was part of a group where a friend, Momoe, shared her asexuality. The other friends immediately supported her, but the author didn't respond in the same way. The author thought maybe asexuality meant not having sexual urges, didn't believe that was possible, and chose to remain silent. When Momoe asked what they thought, the author said they wouldn't care unless it affected them, which made Momoe angry and called them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality entails. Asexual people don't experience sexual attraction, but it's a spectrum. Some might still have romantic feelings or other attractions. The author seems to misunderstand it as not having any sexual urges at all, which might not be accurate. However, the key issue here is the author's reaction. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But when Momoe asked for their opinion, the author gave a dismissive response. Even if the author doesn't personally care, the way they responded could be seen as invalidating Momoe's experience. By not offering support or at least a respectful acknowledgment, the author might have come off as uncaring or judgmental, even if that wasn't their intention. \n\nEven if the author didn't want to engage in the conversation, a neutral or supportive response might have been better. Saying \"you can do what you want\" without any other support could be perceived as dismissive, especially when the author was part of the group that was initially close. The author's lack of empathy and the negative reaction from Momoe suggest that the author's approach was hurtful, even if they didn't mean to be. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respond with the support or respect that someone might expect when sharing such a personal part of their identity. Even if they don't hold the same views, it's important to acknowledge others' feelings and experiences without being dismissive.\n"
