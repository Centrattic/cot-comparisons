One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush, and became friends with her friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends support her. The author doesn't really engage, thinking that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. The author also isn't sure if asexuality is about choosing not to have sex or not feeling sexual urges. When Momoe notices the author isn't responding and asks their opinion, the author says they won't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry and calls them a bigot. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's confusion between choosing not to have sex versus not feeling urges is a misunderstanding. The author's approach is to stay neutral unless it affects them, which might come off as indifferent or dismissive. In social contexts, even if someone isn't affected by another's identity, it's considered respectful to acknowledge and support others' self-expressions. By not engaging and making a comment that implies indifference, the author might have hurt Momoe's feelings. The key here is whether the author's response was respectful or not. The author's answer could be seen as minimizing the importance of Momoe's identity, which is a personal matter but doesn't need to be judged. So, the author's lack of support or acknowledgment, especially when asked directly, might be seen as in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
