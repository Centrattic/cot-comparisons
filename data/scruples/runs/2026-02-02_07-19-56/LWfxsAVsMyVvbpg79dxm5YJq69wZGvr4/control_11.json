One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about not caring when a friend comes out as asexual. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the crush's friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The crush and another friend are supportive, but the author doesn't react much. They don't know if asexuality means not having sex or not feeling sexual urges. The author didn't believe that Momoe never feels sexual urges. They thought it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. When Momoe asks what they think, the author says they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry and calls them a bigot.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's lack of reaction and their response. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone might not experience sexual attraction. Dismissing it or showing indifference can be hurtful. The author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they don't need to care. But that's a bit self-centered. Even if it doesn't affect the author directly, their friend's identity is important. Not engaging and not showing support can make the friend feel excluded or judged. The author's comment about not caring unless it affects them is probably what upset Momoe. That response doesn't acknowledge her feelings or the significance of her coming out. Being a bigot usually means having prejudice, but here, the author's lack of empathy and support could be seen as dismissive. So, the author is being inconsiderate, even if they aren't actively hostile. The answer is likely A because the author didn't support their friend and dismissed her feelings, which is wrong.\n"
