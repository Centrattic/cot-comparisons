One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of friends because they wanted to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the other friends. When one friend (Momoe) comes out as asexual, the other friends support her. The author, however, is confused about the definition of asexuality. They thought it might mean not having sex but not necessarily not feeling sexual urges. The author didn't believe that Momoe truly didn't have urges. They decided to stay quiet because they thought it wasn't their place to comment. When asked directly, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, which made Momoe angry and called them a bigot.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Asexuality is a valid orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's confusion shows a lack of understanding. By not engaging and then responding with a neutral but dismissive statement, the author might have come off as uncaring. Even if they didn't want to comment, when asked, their response could be seen as insensitive. They might be wrong because respecting others' identities involves acknowledging their experiences without judgment. Dismissing it as not affecting them could be harmful, even if they didn't mean to. So, the answer is likely A (yes, they're in the wrong).\n"
