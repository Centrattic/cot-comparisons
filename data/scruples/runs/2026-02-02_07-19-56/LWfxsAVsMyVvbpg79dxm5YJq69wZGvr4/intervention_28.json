One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend was asexual. The author was part of a group where their crush and another friend supported Momoe when she came out as asexual. The author didn't express any opinion, stayed quiet, and when asked, said they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them. Momoe then got angry and called them a bigot. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a social group where others were supportive. The author didn't know the specifics of asexuality and had doubts about whether it meant a lack of sexual urges or just decisions. They remained neutral, not engaging, and when asked, gave a dismissive response. Momoe felt hurt and called them a bigot.\n\nAsexuality is an orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's a valid identity. The author's response of \"you can do what you want as long as it doesn't affect me\" could be seen as dismissive because it frames the friend's identity as irrelevant unless it impacts the author. This might come off as uncaring or indifferent, which can be hurtful even if the author isn't actively opposing the friend's identity.\n\nThe key points here are the author's initial lack of engagement, their dismissive comment, and the friend's hurt reaction. Even if the author didn't intend to be bigoted, the response could be perceived as such because it doesn't acknowledge the friend's feelings or the importance of that coming out moment. The author's reasoning about staying out of it unless it affects them is a common stance, but in a personal relationship, such a reaction can be seen as lacking emotional support or empathy.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's actions and words might have been inappropriate. They didn't support their friend in a time when others were being supportive. Even if they didn't act maliciously, the outcome was hurtful. The author should have considered the friend's feelings and responded more supportively, perhaps asking for clarification or expressing solidarity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
