One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend coming out as asexual and the author not reacting, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was sitting with a group of friends to get closer to a crush. One friend (Momoe) comes out as asexual. The other friends support her, but the author doesn't say much, thinking they don't know enough about asexuality. When asked, the author says they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them, which upsets Momoe who calls the author a bigot.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are the author's response and their attitude towards asexuality. The author didn't support or acknowledge Momoe's coming out, instead saying they don't care unless it affects them. That comes off as dismissive or indifferent. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's comment might be seen as invalidating because they don't believe someone can lack sexual urges, which is a misunderstanding. \n\nEven if the author didn't want to comment, when directly asked, responding with a neutral or supportive statement would be more appropriate. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them can be perceived as not respecting Momoe's identity. The author's reasoning about not commenting if it doesn't affect them is flawed because supporting a friend's identity isn't about personal impact. \n\nSo, the author's actions and words likely hurt their friend and failed to provide the support that others showed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
