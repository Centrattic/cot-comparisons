One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not reacting in a way that the friend found acceptable. \n\nFirst, the author was part of a group where a friend named Momoe came out. The other friends, including the author's crush, immediately supported her. The author, however, didn't have a strong reaction. The author was unsure about the definition of asexuality and didn't want to comment since they didn't think it was their place. When asked directly, the author responded by saying they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe then got angry and called the author a bigot.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's lack of reaction, their initial confusion about asexuality, and their response when confronted. \n\nAsexuality is an orientation where someone may not experience sexual attraction. It's a valid and recognized identity. The author's response of \"you can do what you want unless it affects me\" might come off as indifferent or dismissive. Even though the author didn't intend to judge, the way they handled it could be seen as not validating Momoe's identity. \n\nIn social situations, especially when someone is sharing a personal aspect of their identity, it's important to acknowledge their feelings and offer support, even if you're not fully informed. The author's silence and the subsequent response might have made Momoe feel unaccepted or marginalized. \n\nHowever, the author did say they wouldn't interfere if it didn't affect them. But when someone comes out, it's not just about how it affects you; it's about respecting their identity. The author's approach might be seen as lacking empathy or understanding, which could be why Momoe was upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't actively mock or reject Momoe. They just didn't engage. Some might argue that staying silent isn't necessarily wrong, but in this context, where others were supportive, the author's lack of support could be perceived as negative. \n\nSo, considering that the author didn't provide the same level of support as others, even if unintentionally, they might share some responsibility here. The key is that coming out is a personal moment where validation is important, and the author's response didn't offer that. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
