One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not reacting much, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was part of a group where a friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The author didn't engage in the discussion, stayed quiet, and when asked, responded that they don't care unless it affects them. The friend got angry, called them a bigot. The author is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that they don't believe asexuality is a choice and that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But their friend felt ignored or invalidated. The author didn't express support or understanding, which might have been expected in such a situation. Even if the author doesn't personally care, the friend might have felt that the author's indifference was dismissive or hurtful.\n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation. Not everyone needs to be passionate about it, but reacting with neutrality when a friend is sharing something personal might be seen as not supportive. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's response was hurtful, even if the author didn't mean to be. The author's statement about not caring unless it affects them could be interpreted as not valuing the friend's experience.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone comes out, others usually respond with support or at least empathy. The author's silence and indifferent response didn't contribute to a supportive environment, which might be why the friend accused them of bigotry. Bigotry implies prejudice or intolerance, but the author isn't necessarily opposing asexuality\u2014they're just not engaging. However, the way they handled it could be seen as not respecting the friend's need for support.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and the friend's expectations. The author's approach might be considered dismissive in this case, leading to the friend feeling marginalized. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their response was likely hurtful and not supportive, even if they didn't have ill intentions.\n"
