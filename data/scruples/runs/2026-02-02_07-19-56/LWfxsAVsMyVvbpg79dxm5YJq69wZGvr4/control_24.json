One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring when a friend came out as asexual. The author was trying to get closer to a crush and became friends with her friends. Then, one friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The author's friends immediately supported her, but the author didn't say anything and didn't seem to care. When asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, which made Momoe angry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality entails. Asexual people don't experience sexual attraction, and it's a valid identity. The author's problem seems to be doubting whether someone can truly not have sexual urges. That might stem from a misunderstanding or personal beliefs. \n\nThe author chose not to engage, thinking it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. But by staying silent and then making a dismissive comment when asked, they might have come off as insensitive. Even if they don't personally care, the way they responded could be hurtful. \n\nFriends are supposed to offer support, and not responding in a way that shows understanding or at least respect can be seen as not being supportive. The author's response to the friend's coming out as asexual was not supportive, leading the friend to feel judged. \n\nEven if the author's intention was to stay neutral, not engaging in a supportive way can still be hurtful. The key here is whether the author's actions (or inactions) contributed to making the friend feel uncomfortable or judged. Since the friend felt accused of being a bigot, the author's response likely crossed a line. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respond with the support that others showed, and their comment could have been perceived as dismissive or judgmental. It's not about the content of their belief but how they expressed it and the impact on the friend. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
