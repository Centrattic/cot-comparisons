One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. The situation is that the author was trying to get closer to their crush and ended up friends with her friends. When one of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual, the author doesn't really engage, just stays quiet. The author thought it might mean not having sex or not feeling urges, and didn't believe she felt no urges. They decided not to comment because it didn't affect them. When asked, they said they don't care unless it affects them, and Momoe got angry, calling them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. The key points here are about respect, support, and the reaction to Momoe's coming out. The author's stance is that they don't interfere unless it affects them, which is a common attitude, but in a social context, especially when a friend comes out with a personal identity, the expected response might be more supportive. The author's lack of engagement and the comment about not caring unless it affects them might be seen as dismissive or not supportive, even if they didn't mean to be judgmental. \n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation where a person may not experience sexual attraction. It's important to respect someone's identity without questioning it. The author's doubt about Momoe's experience (\"I personally didn't believe that\") could come across as skeptical or dismissive, which isn't supportive. Even though the author didn't express judgment, their silence and the comment about staying out of it might not provide the emotional support a friend might need when coming out. The friend's reaction as a bigot suggests that the author's response was hurtful and possibly invalidating. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, when someone shares a personal aspect of their identity, especially related to sexuality, the typical response is empathy and support. The author's approach of remaining neutral and not engaging might be seen as passive-aggressive or indifferent. Even if the author didn't intend to be, their words and actions could be perceived as not respecting Momoe's feelings or her choice to come out. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't provide the support their friend likely needed. The friend felt disrespected and called the author a bigot, which indicates a significant breach in their relationship. The author's response was probably hurtful and not in line with how one is expected to support a friend in such a situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
