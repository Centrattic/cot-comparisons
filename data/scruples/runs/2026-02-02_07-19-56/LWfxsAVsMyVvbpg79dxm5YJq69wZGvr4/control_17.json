One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author was part of a group where their friend came out as asexual. The author didn't really engage in the conversation, just stayed quiet, and when asked, responded that they don't care unless it affects them. The friend got angry and called them a bigot. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author was trying to get closer to their crush and became friends with the group. When the friend Momoe came out as asexual, the others were supportive. The author didn't know what asexuality meant\u2014whether it's about not having sex or not feeling sexual urges. The author didn't believe Momoe's claim about no urges. They thought it's not their place to judge, so they stayed silent and didn't act like they cared. When asked, they said they don't care unless it affects them, which led to the friend being upset.\n\nAsexuality is a valid identity where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction. It's not something that can be changed or chosen. The author's response seems dismissive. By saying they don't care unless it affects them, it can come off as not valuing the friend's identity or the importance of the moment. Even if the author didn't have strong opinions, the way they responded could be hurtful. The friend felt judged, which is a common reaction when someone's identity is met with indifference or skepticism.\n\nThe author's argument is that since it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But in friendships, supporting each other through personal revelations is important. Dismissing someone's identity, even if it's not directly affecting you, can damage trust and show a lack of empathy. The author's lack of engagement and the response might have been seen as not respecting Momoe's experience, hence why the friend was upset.\n\nSo, considering that the author didn't actively support or acknowledge the friend's coming out, and their response was indifferent, which led to hurt feelings, it's likely that the author is at fault here. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
