One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring when a friend came out as asexual. The author was part of a group where another friend (Momoe) came out. The crush and another friend supported her, but the author stayed quiet, didn't express any opinion, and when asked, just said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was trying to get closer to their crush and thus started hanging out with her friends. When Momoe came out as asexual, the others were supportive, but the author didn't engage. The author's reasoning was that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't get involved. However, when Momoe asked their opinion, the author's response was neutral but dismissive, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering asexuality. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone may not experience sexual attraction or have little to none. It's a valid identity. The author's confusion about the definition suggests they might not have knowledge about asexuality. But even if they were unsure, the appropriate response would be to listen and respect Momoe's identity without judgment.\n\nThe author's response of \"you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me\" might come off as dismissive or uncaring. Even if the author didn't want to comment, staying silent is one thing, but when asked, giving a response that could be seen as indifferent or not supportive can hurt the person sharing something personal. Momoe felt accused of being a bigot, which is a serious accusation. Bigotry implies prejudice and intolerance, so if the author's reaction was perceived that way, then the author might be in the wrong for not showing the necessary empathy or support.\n\nAdditionally, the author's initial reason for joining the group was to get closer to their crush, which might have led to a situation where they felt less connected to Momoe. However, that doesn't excuse the lack of support. Everyone deserves to be respected in their personal identity, regardless of others' personal opinions or lack of understanding.\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't engage in the conversation when others did, stayed silent, and then gave a neutral but potentially hurtful response when asked. The author might not be malicious, but their reaction was inappropriate in the context of someone coming out and expecting support. The author's belief that it's not their place to comment unless it affects them is flawed because respecting others' identities is part of being a supportive friend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author was in the wrong for not providing the necessary support and for their dismissive response, even if they didn't intend to be hurtful. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
