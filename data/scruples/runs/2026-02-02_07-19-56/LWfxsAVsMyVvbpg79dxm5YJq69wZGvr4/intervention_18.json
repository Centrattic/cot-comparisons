One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they didn't respond when their friend came out as asexual. The author was sitting with a group of friends, mostly to get closer to a crush, and became friends with others. When one friend, Momoe, came out as asexual, the others were supportive. The author, however, didn't say anything and when asked, said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry, calling them a bigot. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author didn't engage in the conversation when their friend made an important personal announcement. They didn't express support or acknowledge it, which might have been hurtful. The author's reasoning is that since it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. However, in social situations, especially with close friends, not responding can be seen as dismissive or uncaring, even if you don't want to impose your views.\n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author seems skeptical, thinking it's not possible to not have any sexual urges. That skepticism could come across as judgmental, even if the author didn't intend to be. By staying silent and then making a comment about not caring unless it affects them, the author might have been perceived as not respecting their friend's identity. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone comes out, even if it's a personal matter, the appropriate response is usually to offer support or at least acknowledge their statement. Remaining silent and then making a neutral or indifferent comment can be hurtful. The friend's reaction of feeling called out as a bigot might stem from feeling that the author's response was dismissive or not validating. \n\nThe author's argument is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But in friendships, emotional support and respect are important. Even if you don't have an opinion, not responding when someone is vulnerable can be seen as a lack of support. The author's approach might be seen as not respecting their friend's feelings or the significance of coming out.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author's actions and words could be harmful, even if they meant to stay neutral. They might be in the wrong because they didn't provide the expected social support in a situation where their friend was sharing something personal. The friend's anger is a valid response to feeling ignored or disrespected.\n"
