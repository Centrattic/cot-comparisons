One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not responding as expected, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality means. Asexual people either don't experience sexual attraction or have little to none. The author misunderstood it as just a choice to not have sex, which is a common misconception. That might be part of the issue.\n\nThe author was friends with Momoe because they were trying to get closer to their crush. So the friendship might have been situational. When Momoe came out, others supported her, but the author stayed silent and didn't express support. Then, when asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot.\n\nA key point here is the author's attitude. Even if they don't have strong feelings about it, not showing support or being indifferent can be hurtful. The author might not have meant to be judgmental, but their response was dismissive. Also, the author didn't believe Momoe when she said she didn't feel sexual urges, which shows a lack of trust in her experience. That's a problem because asexuality is a valid identity, and doubting someone's experience of their own orientation is not okay.\n\nAnother angle is the social context. The author was part of a group where others were supportive. The author's lack of response might make Momoe feel excluded, especially after others were supportive. Even if the author isn't directly attacking, their silence and indifferent statement could be seen as invalidating.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they don't care unless it affects them. However, personal identity isn't something that just affects others. By not respecting the importance of Momoe's identity, the author is being insensitive, even if they don't mean to. So, the author might be in the wrong for not providing the support their friend needed and for doubting her experience.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they were dismissive and didn't support their friend during a vulnerable moment, leading to hurt feelings.\n"
