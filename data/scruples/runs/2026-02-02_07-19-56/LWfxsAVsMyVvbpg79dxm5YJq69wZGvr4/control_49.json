One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author was sitting with a group of girls, trying to get closer to their crush, and became friends with her friends. One of them, Momoe, came out as asexual. The author's crush and another friend immediately said they wouldn't judge. The author, however, didn't respond and stayed quiet. They didn't act like they cared and when asked, said they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's a valid identity, and people should respect that. The author seems confused about what asexuality means\u2014thinking it's either a choice to not have sex or not feeling any sexual urges. They even express doubt that Momoe doesn't have urges, which might imply a lack of understanding or acceptance.\n\nThe author's response was to stay silent and not engage, then when questioned, they said they don't care unless it affects them. This could be seen as dismissive. By not showing support or at least openness, the author might be perceived as not respecting Momoe's identity. Even if they don't personally have an issue with it, their response could come off as judgmental or indifferent, which Momoe found hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are respect for others' identities and the importance of inclusive behavior. Even if someone doesn't personally care, the way they respond can make others feel invalidated. The author's approach might have marginalized their friend, leading to the conflict. So, while the author might not have intended harm, their actions and words could be seen as wrong because they didn't support their friend in a way that fosters acceptance. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
