One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not caring when their friend came out as asexual. The situation involves the author sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush, and forming a friendship with Momoe. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the others support her, but the author remains silent, doesn't express concern, and later tells her to do what she wants as long as it doesn't affect them. Momoe gets angry and calls the author a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction. The author's friend Momoe is coming out, which is a personal and sensitive moment. The author's response is to say they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them. The key issue here is whether the author's indifference is inappropriate.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment on it. However, in social interactions, especially among friends, showing support and empathy is often expected. Coming out can be a vulnerable experience, so the author's lack of response might be perceived as dismissive or uncaring. The fact that the author never tried to care and remained quiet could be seen as not supporting a friend who was being vulnerable.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that they don't believe Momoe doesn't have sexual urges might indicate a lack of understanding or even a judgmental attitude, even if they didn't express it. The author's subsequent comment about not caring unless it affects them might be seen as putting themselves above the situation, which can be hurtful when someone is sharing personal information.\n\nThe friend's reaction of anger and feeling called out as a bigot suggests that the author's response was perceived as offensive. Even if the author had no intention to harm, the impact of their words and silence matters. In many social contexts, it's important to acknowledge others' experiences and show solidarity, even if you don't fully understand or agree.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author might not have personal issues with asexuality but chose to remain neutral. But neutrality in the face of someone's vulnerability and seeking support can be seen as a lack of empathy. Friends are expected to offer some level of support, even if they don't share the same experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have meant to be hurtful, their lack of engagement and indifferent response could be seen as inconsiderate. The wrong lies in not providing the expected level of support to a friend during a personal moment, hence the author is in the wrong.\n"
