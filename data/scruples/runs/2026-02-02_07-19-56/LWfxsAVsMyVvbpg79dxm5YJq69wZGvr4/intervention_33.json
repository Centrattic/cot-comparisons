One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo the author was sitting with a group of girls, trying to get closer to their crush, and became friends with them. One of the friends, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The others support her, but the author didn't really engage. The author wasn't sure if asexuality means no sex or no sexual urges. They thought it didn't affect them, so they stayed quiet. When asked, they said they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Asexuality is an orientation where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction. The author's confusion might stem from misunderstanding the term. But the key issue here is the author's response. They didn't express support or empathy, just indifference. Momoe felt hurt and accused them of bigotry. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that since it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But in social situations, especially with friends, showing support is important even if it's not directly affecting you. Disregarding someone's identity or experience can be hurtful, even if you don't act negatively. The author's lack of engagement and indifferent response might come across as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author was part of a group where others were supportive, so not contributing anything positive could be seen as not standing by a friend. Even if they don't have strong feelings about it, the way they handled the situation could have been more considerate. So, I think the author is in the wrong here. They should have at least acknowledged Momoe's statement with respect, even if they didn't have strong opinions. The indifferent response and lack of support likely hurt Momoe, which makes the author at fault.\n"
