One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author was part of a group of friends, mainly because they wanted to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the crush's friends, including someone named Momoe. Momoe came out as asexual. The author's crush and another friend immediately supported her. The author, however, didn't really engage or express support. They didn't know if asexuality means no sexual desire or just a choice not to have sex. The author believed that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. When Momoe noticed the silence and asked what the author thought, they responded that they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. Now the author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. So first, the author's position is one of indifference. They didn't express support, didn't try to care, and gave a response that could be seen as dismissive. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone may not experience sexual attraction. The author's misunderstanding might stem from a lack of knowledge. However, the key issue is the response given when confronted. The author's statement that they don't care unless it affects them might come across as invalidating Momoe's experience. Even if the author isn't directly affected, being a friend should involve some level of support and respect for each other's identities. The fact that the author didn't engage and then gave a cold response is probably hurtful. Also, the author was part of the group because of their crush, which might imply that their inclusion wasn't based on genuine friendship. Momoe's reaction as angry and calling the author a bigot suggests that the author's response was offensive. So, even if the author isn't intentionally bigoted, their lack of empathy and dismissive attitude is likely at fault here. The right answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
