One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a group of girls where they initially sat to get closer to their crush. As a result, they became friends with her friends, including Momoe. Recently, Momoe came out as asexual. The crush and the other girl responded supportively, but the author didn't really say anything. They were unsure if asexuality meant just choosing not to have sex or not feeling any sexual urges. The author's belief is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't get involved. So they stayed quiet, didn't express any opinion, and when Momoe asked what they thought, the author said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe then got angry and called the author a bigot. The author is asking if they're the asshole in this scenario.\n\nFirst, let me recall what asexuality means. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone does not experience sexual attraction. It's part of the asexual spectrum, and it's not just a choice to abstain from sex. So Momoe's statement was about her identity, not just a decision she made. The author's confusion between asexuality as a choice versus a natural state might stem from a lack of understanding or misinformation.\n\nNow, the author's response to Momoe's coming out. They remained silent initially, then when asked, gave a dismissive answer. The key points here are the author's lack of support and their dismissive attitude. Even though they claim not to care unless it affects them, the act of not showing support when a friend comes out can be hurtful. Friends are expected to be supportive, especially in personal matters like one's sexual orientation.\n\nThe author's reasoning that it's not their place to comment because it doesn't affect them is problematic. Just because something doesn't affect you personally doesn't mean you should be indifferent. Respecting a friend's identity and offering support is important, regardless of your own feelings or beliefs. Moreover, the way the author responded when asked directly was not supportive. Telling someone you don't care about their identity could be perceived as invalidating or disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author's initial motivation for joining the group (to get closer to a crush) might have led to forming a friendship with Momoe, which adds a layer where the author might be expected to have some level of empathy and support. The fact that the other friends were supportive and the author was not could have caused Momoe to feel excluded or not accepted by the group.\n\nAnother angle is the author's assumption that Momoe's asexuality is a lie or a misunderstanding. The author didn't believe that someone could truly not have sexual urges, which is a common misconception. This skepticism could be seen as dismissive and not respecting Momoe's self-identification.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when a friend comes out, even if it's something you don't fully understand, the appropriate response is to listen, support, and not question their validity. The author's response of \"you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me\" seems cold and could be hurtful because it comes off as not valuing the importance of the disclosure.\n\nSo, putting this all together: The author didn't support Momoe's coming out, showed confusion and disbelief about asexuality, and responded dismissively. These actions likely hurt Momoe, and the author's justification for not caring because it doesn't affect them is a common excuse for not engaging with others' identities. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
