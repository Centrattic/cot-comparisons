One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about the author not caring that their friend is asexual.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was at lunch with a group of friends, including their crush. They became friends with the group to get closer to the crush. One of the friends, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends immediately support her. The author didn't respond and remained silent, thinking it's not their place to judge. When asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, which upset Momoe and led to the accusation of being a bigot.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's response (or lack thereof) and the subsequent statement that they don't care unless it affects them. The author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they should stay out of it. But the friend felt invalidated and called the author a bigot.\n\nNow, considering asexuality. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's not a choice, but a part of their identity. The author's skepticism about whether Momoe has no sexual urges might stem from a misunderstanding of asexuality. Some asexual people might still experience romantic attraction or other forms of connection without sexual desire.\n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as dismissive or not taking Momoe's identity seriously. Even if the author didn't want to comment, staying silent in a situation where a friend is opening up about an important part of their identity can come across as uncaring or dismissive. When asked directly, the author's response was not supportive and implied indifference, which could hurt the friend's feelings and make her feel like her identity isn't accepted.\n\nSocietal norms and empathy play a role here. Even if the author's intention was to be non-judgmental, the way they handled it might have been inappropriate. Supporting a friend's identity doesn't require changing your views, but it does require respecting their feelings and not belittling their experience. The author's statement \"you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me\" can be perceived as treating the friend's identity as something trivial or only relevant if it impacts the author.\n\nThe friend's reaction of anger and calling the author a bigot suggests that the author's response caused hurt. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their actions crossed the line into being disrespectful or harmful. Even if the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the impact of their words matters. The friend felt invalidated, which indicates that the author's approach was flawed.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's lack of engagement and the dismissive comment likely contributed to the friend feeling unsupported. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their response was not supportive and potentially hurtful, even if they intended to be neutral.\n"
