One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not reacting as expected, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of friends, trying to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the group, including Momoe. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the others support her. The author didn't say anything, just stayed quiet. Momoe noticed and asked their opinion, so the author said they won't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. Let's break down the key points. The author didn't express support, just remained neutral. They admitted they don't understand asexuality properly but didn't engage. When asked, they gave a neutral response, which Momoe took as negative. The author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, it's not their place to comment.\n\nBut here's the thing: when someone comes out, especially in a group setting, even if you don't know how to respond, your silence can be perceived as indifference or lack of support. The friends around Momoe did show support, so her expectation might be that others would do the same. The author's response of \"you can do what you want as long as it doesn't affect me\" could be seen as dismissive, even if it's meant to be neutral. It doesn't acknowledge her right to exist as asexual without judgment, which is part of the support. The author isn't attacking her, but their approach might not be supportive enough. The problem here is more about the lack of empathy and support in a situation where the person might be seeking acceptance. The author's reasoning about staying out of it unless it affects them is a personal choice, but in social contexts, especially when others are supportive, not showing solidarity can be seen as harmful, even if unintended. So, the author might be in the wrong for not showing the same level of support as others, even if their intention was neutral.\n"
