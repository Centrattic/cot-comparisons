One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not caring about their friend being asexual.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of friends to get closer to their crush, which led to befriending others. When one friend, Momoe, came out as asexual, the others showed support. The author didn't engage, stayed quiet, and didn't express any judgment. Momoe noticed and asked the author's opinion, to which the author responded that they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe got upset, calling the author a bigot.\n\nNow, asexuality is an inherent part of someone's identity, not a choice. The author's confusion between asexuality as a choice versus a natural state shows a lack of understanding. By remaining silent and then giving a dismissive response, the author might have been perceived as uncaring or judgmental, even if they didn't intend to be.\n\nThe key points here are the author's lack of empathy, not engaging in supportive behavior, and the dismissive comment. Even if the author wasn't trying to be bigoted, their actions could still hurt Momoe. The fact that they didn't care enough to participate in the supportive conversation and instead gave a neutral, uncaring response is problematic. The author should have made an effort to support their friend or at least be more considerate in their response, even if they don't fully understand the issue.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not showing the necessary support and for the way they responded. The answer should be A.\n"
