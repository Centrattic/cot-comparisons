One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not really caring or responding in a way that made the friend upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was sitting with a group of friends to get closer to their crush. When their friend Momoe comes out as asexual, the others support her, but the author doesn't respond and later says they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them. Momoe gets angry and calls them a bigot.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't believe asexuality is about not having urges (they think it's about not wanting to have sex), and they feel it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. The author's skepticism about whether asexual people have sexual urges is incorrect. Asexuality is more about lack of sexual attraction, not necessarily the absence of all sexual feelings. The author's dismissive attitude and lack of support could be seen as invalidating Momoe's experience.\n\nAlso, the author admitted they didn't care and didn't try to act like they did. When confronted, they gave a neutral but indifferent response, which Momoe took as bigotry. Even if the author's intention was to not judge unless it affects them, their response might have come off as uncaring or dismissive, which can hurt a friend who is sharing something personal.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone shares a personal aspect of their identity, the expected response is usually support and openness. The author's reaction, while not overtly hostile, was neutral to indifferent, which might not be what Momoe needed. The fact that the other friends were supportive and the author was not could make their behavior stand out negatively.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's lack of support and their dismissive comment likely hurt Momoe. Even if they didn't mean to be judgmental, their actions and words could be seen as not respecting her feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not responding supportively and for the indifferent attitude towards her coming out.\n"
