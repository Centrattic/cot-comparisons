One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not caring that their friend is asexual. The scenario is that the author was trying to get closer to their crush and ended up befriending her friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends are supportive, but the author doesn't engage. When asked, the author responds neutrally, not expressing judgment but also not showing interest. Momoe gets angry and calls the author a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexual people experience little to no sexual attraction. It's a valid part of the spectrum, just like other orientations. The author seems confused about the definition, thinking it might mean just choosing not to have sex rather than a lack of sexual desire. But the key here is the author's response. They stayed silent, didn't express support or concern, and when asked, gave a noncommittal answer. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But in social situations, especially when someone opens up, a lack of response can be perceived as indifference or even hostility. Being asexual isn't something that affects others, but when someone shares such a personal part of their identity, expecting others to acknowledge it is reasonable. The author didn't show support, which might make the friend feel invalidated. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about not believing the friend's asexuality suggests a lack of acceptance, which can be hurtful. Even if they don't judge, not affirming someone's identity can be seen as bigoted. The friend's reaction is understandable if they felt dismissed. \n\nSo, even if the author isn't trying to be judgmental, their inaction and dismissive response could be harmful. The right approach would be to listen, offer support, and respect the person's identity without questioning it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
