One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was in a group where a friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The author's initial reason for being in the group was to get closer to their crush, which might affect their perspective. The author didn't believe Momoe when she said she doesn't feel sexual urges and stayed quiet during the conversation. When asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, leading Momoe to call them a bigot.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider asexuality. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's not a choice, and many asexual people do have romantic orientations. The author's disbelief suggests a lack of understanding or possibly a prejudice against asexuality. By not supporting Momoe and even dismissing her experience, the author is failing to respect her identity. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that since it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But that's a problematic stance because respecting others' identities isn't about personal impact. Everyone deserves to be heard and validated. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them is dismissive and contributes to a hostile environment. \n\nAlso, the author's initial motivation (crush) might have led them to not prioritize building a genuine connection with Momoe, resulting in a lack of empathy here. \n\nSo, the author's actions are hurtful and disrespectful. They should have educated themselves on asexuality and supported their friend instead of being dismissive. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
