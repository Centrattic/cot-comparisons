One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush. One friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The crush and others immediately support her. The author, however, is confused about what asexuality means. They don't believe that asexual people don't have sexual urges and decide not to say anything, thinking it's not their place to comment. When Momoe asks the author's opinion, they respond that they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe then gets angry and calls the author a bigot.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't express support when others did. They didn't engage in the conversation, stayed quiet, and when asked, gave a dismissive response. The author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they don't need to comment. But Momoe felt disrespected.\n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction. It's important to respect people's identities without judgment. The author's disbelief in Momoe's experience (assuming she's lying about not having sexual urges) is problematic because it invalidates her identity. Even if the author didn't want to comment, when asked, their response was hurtful. Dismissing someone's identity as not important unless it affects you can be seen as indifferent or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the author's initial motivation for being in the group was to get closer to their crush, which might have contributed to a lack of genuine interest in Momoe's identity. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them can be hurtful because it implies that personal identity is only worth respecting if it impacts the person directly. \n\nIn terms of social norms, supporting friends in their self-expression is generally expected, even if you don't share the same views. The author's silence and dismissive attitude could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment, even if they didn't mean to. Momoe felt judged, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nSo, the author's actions\u2014staying silent when others supported, and then giving a dismissive answer\u2014likely made Momoe feel excluded and disrespected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to respect and support their friend's identity, even if they didn't intend to.\n"
