One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend coming out as asexual and the author not reacting, which led to the friend getting angry and calling them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was part of a group of friends where one member, Momoe, came out as asexual. The author didn't express support and instead remained quiet. When asked, they responded that they wouldn't care unless it affected them, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't believe Momoe truly lacks sexual urges and think it's not their place to comment if it doesn't affect them. However, Momoe felt disrespected and accused the author of being bigoted. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's reaction was wrong. Asexual is an identity that means someone does not experience sexual attraction. The author's doubt about Momoe's statement might stem from a misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about asexuality. By not supporting her and making a dismissive comment, the author might have been invalidating her identity, even if they didn't intend to. \n\nEven if the author didn't care, the way they responded\u2014by not engaging and then making a neutral but possibly indifferent statement\u2014could be hurtful. The friend felt judged, which is a common issue when people feel their identity is not respected. The author's approach of staying silent and then giving a non-supportive response might not be the best way to show acceptance. \n\nSensitivity and empathy are important in such situations. Even if someone doesn't understand or relate to another's identity, it's important to respect it. The author's response could be seen as lacking in empathy, which might be why Momoe felt targeted. So, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's disclosure, even if they didn't have negative intentions.\n"
