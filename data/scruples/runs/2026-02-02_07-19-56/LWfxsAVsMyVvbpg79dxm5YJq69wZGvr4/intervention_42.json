One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. The situation is that the author was sitting with a group of girls, mainly to get closer to their crush, and became friends with her friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The crush and others immediately support her. The author, however, is unsure about what asexuality means and doesn't believe that asexual people don't have any sexual urges. They decide to stay quiet, not wanting to comment unless it affects them. When Momoe asks for their opinion, the author responds that they don't care unless it affects them, leading Momoe to get angry and call them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are understanding asexuality and the social dynamics involved. Asexuality is an orientation where a person does not experience sexual attraction. It's a valid identity, and it's important to respect others' self-identification. The author's lack of engagement and their dismissive attitude might be seen as insensitive, even if they didn't intend to be mean. \n\nThe author mentions they didn't believe Momoe about not having sexual urges. That's a problematic assumption because asexuality is a real orientation, not a choice or a phase. Assuming someone is lying or exaggerating about their identity is disrespectful. Also, by staying silent and then giving a nonchalant response when asked, the author didn't offer the support or acknowledgment that Momoe might have needed. \n\nEven if the author felt it wasn't their place to comment, responding with indifference when someone shares such a personal aspect of their identity can be hurtful. The author's position that they don't care unless it affects them could come across as dismissive of Momoe's feelings and experience. It's important in friendships to acknowledge and respect each other's identities, even if you don't fully understand them. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to be hurtful. They tried to avoid judgment, but their response was inappropriate. The fact that they didn't engage in the support shown by others might make them seem uncaring. Momoe's reaction of feeling called out as a bigot is a valid response to being treated with indifference rather than empathy.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions likely were inconsiderate towards Momoe's feelings. They didn't respect her experience, made incorrect assumptions about asexuality, and responded in a way that could be seen as prejudiced. Even if they didn't mean to be judgmental, their behavior was hurtful and didn't support their friend. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
