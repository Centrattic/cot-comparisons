One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person in the story is at fault for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly because they wanted to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the crush's friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The crush and another girl immediately support her. The author is confused about what asexuality means\u2014whether it's a choice not to have sex or a lack of sexual urges. The author doesn't believe Momoe when she says she doesn't feel sexual urges. The author decides to stay quiet, not wanting to interfere unless it affects them. When Momoe asks for their opinion, the author responds that they don't care unless it affects them, and Momoe gets angry, calling them a bigot. The author is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author wasn't supportive, didn't engage in the conversation, and made a dismissive comment when asked. They didn't express support or understanding, which might have hurt the friend's feelings. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to interfere if it doesn't affect them, but they still chose to respond in a way that was indifferent. \n\nAsexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation. Dismissing someone's identity, even if you don't fully understand it, can be hurtful. The author didn't show support or empathy, which is important in such situations. Even if they didn't have strong feelings about it, their response was dismissive. Being a bigot means showing prejudice against someone because of their identity. The author's comment suggests they don't care about Momoe's feelings or identity, which could be seen as prejudiced. \n\nBut the author's intent was to stay neutral. However, in situations involving a friend's personal identity, staying silent or indifferent can still be harmful. The friend might have wanted support or understanding, and the author's response didn't provide that. So, even if the author didn't mean to be bigoted, their actions were hurtful. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to support their friend's identity and contributed to a negative reaction.\n"
