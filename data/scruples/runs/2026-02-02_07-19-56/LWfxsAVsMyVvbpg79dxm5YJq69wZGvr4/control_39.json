One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring when their friend Momoe came out as asexual. The key points here are the author's reaction and their reasoning.\n\nFirst, the author was only sitting with the group to get closer to their crush, which might imply that their interest in the group wasn't genuine. Then, when Momoe comes out as asexual, the author doesn't respond supportively and instead stays quiet, not showing any interest. They later say they don't believe Momoe's claim about not having sexual urges and even tell her they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe takes offense and calls the author a bigot.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's dismissive attitude and lack of support could be seen as invalidating Momoe's identity. Even if the author didn't show active judgment, their indifference and the comment about not caring unless it affects them might be hurtful. In social situations, especially when someone is sharing a personal aspect of their identity, it's generally expected to respond with some level of empathy or at least not be dismissive. The author's lack of engagement and the subsequent comment could come off as insensitive, even if they didn't mean to be. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
