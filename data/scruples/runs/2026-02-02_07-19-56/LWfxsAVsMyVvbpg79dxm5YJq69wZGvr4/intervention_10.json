One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author didn't react much, leading the friend to feel judged and call them a bigot.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group to get closer to their crush and ended up friends with the others. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the other friends support her. The author, however, doesn't believe that asexual people don't have sexual urges and chooses to stay silent, not engaging. When asked for their opinion, the author responds neutrally but the friend gets upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect, understanding, and empathy. Asexuality is an identity where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. It's a valid orientation, and while the author might not fully understand it, their reaction of staying silent and not showing interest could be perceived as dismissive or disrespectful. The author's belief that they shouldn't comment unless it affects them might be a personal stance, but in social contexts, especially when someone is sharing something personal, the right response isn't just about whether it affects you but about showing support and respect for others' identities.\n\nThe author's response of \"you can do what you want unless it affects me\" sounds like a disinterest in the friend's personal life, which can come off as indifferent or judgmental. Even if they don't personally understand or agree with the experience, it's important to validate others' identities. The friend feeling called out as a bigot might be because the author's reaction didn't acknowledge the significance of Momoe's disclosure. \n\nAlso, the author's initial disbelief about not having sexual urges could stem from a lack of understanding or stereotypes. Asexual individuals might have varying experiences, including some who do feel sexual desire but not attraction, or none at all. The author's skepticism could contribute to the friend feeling invalidated. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be hurtful, their reaction likely made Momoe feel unwelcome or judged. In such situations, being supportive and non-judgmental is key, even if you don't fully grasp the experience. The author's inaction and indifferent response can be seen as not respecting their friend's identity, which is why they might be in the wrong.\n"
