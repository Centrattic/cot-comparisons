One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. \n\nFirst, let me understand the scenario. The author was at lunch with a group of girls, trying to get closer to their crush and became friends with her friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends (the crush and another girl) support her. The author doesn't understand asexuality, thinking it might mean not having sex or not having sexual urges. The author didn't believe that Momoe truly doesn't have urges and didn't say anything, staying quiet. When Momoe asks the author's opinion, the author says they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry, calling the author a bigot.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. From what I know, asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction. It's not a choice or something that can be \"fixed.\" The author's reaction seems dismissive and possibly ignorant. By not supporting Momoe and instead stating they don't care unless it affects them, the author might be invalidating her identity. The author's belief that it's not their place to comment unless it affects them could be seen as a way to avoid engaging, but that doesn't excuse not being supportive. Also, the author's lack of understanding and not believing Momoe's experience could contribute to the hurt feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone comes out, it's generally expected to be supportive, even if you're not sure you understand. The author's response might be seen as insensitive, even if their intention was to stay neutral. The key issue here is the author's failure to offer support and their apparent disbelief in Momoe's identity, which can be hurtful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
