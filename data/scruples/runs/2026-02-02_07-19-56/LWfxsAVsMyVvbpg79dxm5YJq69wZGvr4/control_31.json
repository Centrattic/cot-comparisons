One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not really caring or engaging in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was trying to get closer to their crush and ended up becoming friends with the crush's friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The author is confused about what asexuality means\u2014whether it's a choice or a lack of sexual urges. They don't express any judgment but also don't show support. When Momoe asks for their opinion, the author says they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry and calls them a bigot.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nAsexuality is an orientation, not a choice. The author's confusion might stem from a lack of understanding. However, the author didn't confront Momoe about her orientation but instead stayed neutral. When asked, they gave a response that was dismissive but not hostile. However, their comment about not caring unless it affects them could be seen as invalidating. Momoe felt judged, but the author claims they didn't mean to be.\n\nIn terms of social standards, being supportive of a friend's identity is important. Even if the author doesn't fully understand or care, responding in a way that's dismissive can hurt feelings. The author's response might come off as indifferent or uncaring, which could be why Momoe felt targeted. However, the author didn't attack her identity; they just stated their neutrality. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was harmful. By saying they don't care unless it affects them, it might imply that the author doesn't validate Momoe's feelings or identity. Even if the author isn't actively opposing asexuality, their response could be perceived as dismissive. In a supportive environment, friends should encourage each other's identities without judgment. The author's neutrality might not be the best approach here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't mocking or attacking Momoe. They just didn't express support. But in many cases, silence or indifference can be seen as a lack of support. The friend might need validation and support, and the author's response might not have provided that. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their response could have been hurtful, even if unintentionally. They didn't show support, which is expected in a friendship when someone shares something personal. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
