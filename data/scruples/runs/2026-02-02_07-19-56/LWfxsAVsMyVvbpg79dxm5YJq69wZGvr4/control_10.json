One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not reacting in a supportive way, which led to the friend getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author was sitting with a group of friends, trying to get closer to a crush. They became friends with her friends. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the crush and another girl support her. The author, however, is confused about what asexuality means\u2014whether it's a choice or a lack of sexual urges. The author didn't believe Momoe when she said she doesn't have urges. The author decided to stay silent, not wanting to comment unless it affects them. When asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, and the friend got angry, calling them a bigot.\n\nSo the key points here are about respecting others' identities and the author's response. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. It's not a choice. The author's confusion shows a lack of understanding, which is a problem. By not supporting Momoe and instead making a dismissive comment, the author is being insensitive. Just because the author doesn't directly affect the situation doesn't mean they can comment that way. Being a good friend involves listening and supporting, even if you don't fully understand. The author's response was hurtful and invalidated Momoe's experience, which is why the friend felt targeted. So, the author is in the wrong for not showing support and making a judgmental remark. The answer should be A.\n"
