One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not reacting when a friend comes out as asexual. The author was part of a group where others were supportive, but he stayed quiet because he didn't know the exact implications of asexuality and didn't want to comment if it didn't affect him. Then when asked, he said he doesn't care unless it affects him, which made his friend angry and called him a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexual people don't experience sexual attraction. It's an orientation, not a choice. The author seems to be confused about whether asexuality is a decision or a lack of sexual desire. His response was dismissive, which could be hurtful. Even if he didn't know, the friend might have expected support, like the others showed. By staying silent and then giving a nonchalant answer, he didn't affirm her identity. Also, treating it as something that only matters if it affects him personally might be seen as invalidating her experience. People often want support from friends regardless of direct impact. So the author's response, while not overtly hostile, could be considered insensitive. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
