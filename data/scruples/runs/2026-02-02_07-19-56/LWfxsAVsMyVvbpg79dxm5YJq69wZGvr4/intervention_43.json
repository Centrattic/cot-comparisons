One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. The author was part of a group where the friend disclosed her asexuality. The other friends immediately supported her, but the author didn't react and stayed quiet. When asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, and the friend got upset, calling them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what asexuality means. It's a sexual orientation where a person doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's a valid identity, and coming out is a personal choice. The key here is the author's response. They didn't express support, didn't engage in the conversation, and when asked, they said they don't care. The friend felt judged or disrespected, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't believe the friend's asexuality affects them, so they stayed silent. But the issue here is about respecting someone's identity and showing support. Even if it doesn't affect the author personally, the act of not engaging or showing indifference can be hurtful. Coming out is a significant moment, and a supportive response is important. The friend likely expected at least some acknowledgment or support, even if the author wasn't going to comment on the details.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that they don't care could come off as dismissive. It's not about personal beliefs about asexuality but about respecting a friend's choice to share something personal. The author's approach might be seen as not valuing the friend's feelings or the importance of her disclosure. The friend's reaction as a bigot suggests that the author's response was perceived as judgmental, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's lack of support and the dismissive response likely made the friend feel marginalized. Even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the effect was there. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to provide the support and respect that their friend needed in that moment.\n"
