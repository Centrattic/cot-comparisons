One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush. One of the friends, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other girls support her, but the author doesn't react much. The author isn't sure if asexuality means not having sexual urges or just not wanting to have sex. They don't believe Momoe when she says she doesn't have sexual urges. The author decides to stay quiet, thinking it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. When Momoe asks for their opinion, the author says they don't care unless it affects them, which makes Momoe angry and calls them a bigot. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are misunderstanding asexuality, not showing support, and the author's reasoning for not engaging. The author's lack of reaction and the dismissive comment when asked probably hurt Momoe. Asexuality is a valid orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction, and it's not about making a decision. The author's doubt about Momoe's claim and their indifferent response could be seen as invalidating her identity. Even if the author didn't want to comment, when directly asked, responding with indifference might come off as being judgmental or not respecting her. The author's approach of staying silent unless it affects them isn't empathetic in this context. It seems like the author didn't support their friend, leading to conflict. So, probably the author is in the wrong here.\n"
