One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author was sitting with a group of friends, trying to get closer to their crush, and became friends with her friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends immediately say they don't judge her. The author is confused about what asexuality means\u2014whether it's a choice to not have sex or a lack of sexual urges. They don't believe Momoe when she says she has no sexual urges. The author decides not to comment since they think it's not their place, but when asked, they say they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry and calls them a bigot. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction to others. It's not a choice but part of their identity. The author's confusion might stem from a lack of understanding. However, the key issue here is the author's reaction. By not supporting Momoe and instead being indifferent, they might have come off as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But when someone shares a personal part of their identity, expecting support or at least respectful silence is reasonable. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them can be hurtful because it invalidates Momoe's feelings and identity. \n\nAlso, the author didn't try to educate themselves about asexuality, which could have helped them respond better. By not engaging and then giving a dismissive answer, they might have hurt Momoe. The friends who supported her immediately showed that sharing such information is part of their trust and openness in the group. The author's lack of support could be seen as a breach of that trust.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone comes out, even if the listener isn't affected, a supportive response is usually expected. The author's response might have been perceived as indifferent or even judgmental, even if that wasn't their intention. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's indifference and the subsequent comment could be hurtful. Even if they didn't mean to be, their actions didn't support their friend's personal statement, which is a significant part of their identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
