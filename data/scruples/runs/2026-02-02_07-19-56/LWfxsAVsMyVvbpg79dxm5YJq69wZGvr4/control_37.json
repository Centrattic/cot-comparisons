One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of girls at lunch to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the group, and one of them, Momoe, came out as asexual. The other friends, including the crush, supported her. The author, however, didn't have a strong reaction. They didn't believe Momoe when she said she has no sexual urges and decided to stay quiet, not wanting to comment on her identity. When Momoe asked for the author's opinion, the author said they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe then got angry and called the author a bigot. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nSo, considering the options A and B, where A is the author is in the wrong and B is not. Let's think about the key points here.\n\nAsexuality is an inherent part of someone's identity. The author's belief that they don't need to care unless it affects them might come across as dismissive. Even if the author doesn't have strong feelings about it, their response could be seen as not respecting Momoe's identity. The author's lack of response and the comment about not caring unless affected might be interpreted as indifference or judgment, even if that's not their intention. \n\nWhen Momoe asked for the author's thoughts, the author's response was neutral but perhaps dismissive. The author's internal belief that they don't need to care unless it affects them could be viewed as not acknowledging Momoe's right to self-identify. Even if the author didn't express judgment, their silence and subsequent comment might have made Momoe feel invalidated or disrespected. \n\nIt's also important to consider the social context. The other friends were supportive, so the author's reaction was in contrast. The author's response might have been seen as not aligning with the group's supportive stance, which could have been hurtful. The author's not engaging in the support might have made Momoe feel isolated in that moment.\n\nHowever, the author didn't actively criticize Momoe. They just didn't engage and stated their neutrality. But the problem here is that in situations where someone comes out, expecting a positive or at least neutral response is reasonable. The author's statement that they don't care unless it affects them might be seen as putting personal feelings above respecting someone else's identity. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone doesn't have strong opinions, it's often expected to be supportive when a friend shares something personal. The author's response could be perceived as uncaring, even if they didn't mean to be. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not showing support and for the comment that could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong. They didn't respect Momoe's feelings by not showing support, even if they didn't actively criticize her. Their response, while neutral, might have been hurtful and not in line with the supportive environment the other friends provided.\n"
