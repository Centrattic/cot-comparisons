One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author was part of a group where a friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The crush and other girl immediately supported her, but the author stayed quiet. They later admitted they didn't believe that asexuality means no sexual urges and just said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about how the author responded. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's initial reaction was indifference, which might come off as dismissive. Even though they said they wouldn't judge, their lack of response could be seen as not respecting Momoe's feelings. Then, when asked directly, they made a comment that could be perceived as minimizing the importance of her identity. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But in a close friend group, especially after trying to get closer to the crush, not engaging in a supportive way might make the friend feel isolated. Also, questioning the validity of asexuality shows a lack of understanding or respect for her identity. \n\nWhen someone comes out, the expected response is usually support, even if you don't fully understand it. The author's approach of remaining neutral and only reacting when something affects them might be seen as insensitive. Momoe's reaction suggests that the author's response hurt her feelings, which implies that the author's actions were indeed inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering the social norms around coming out and the importance of being supportive without judgment, the author is likely in the wrong. Their lack of engagement and the dismissive comment contributed to the friend's discomfort. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
