One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was sitting with a group of friends, including their crush and a friend named Momoe. Momoe came out as asexual. The crush and another friend immediately said they wouldn't judge, but the author didn't respond much. The author wasn't sure if asexuality was about not having sex or not feeling sexual urges. They thought maybe Momoe didn't really feel urges and didn't believe her. The author decided not to comment since they thought it wasn't their place to judge and said they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe got angry and called the author a bigot. Now the author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around coming out. When someone shares their identity, especially something personal like asexuality, it's generally expected that others will be supportive. The author didn't show support and instead stayed silent, then made a non-committal response. The crush and the other friend were supportive, so the author's lack of response might have been seen as dismissive or indifferent. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But when someone shares something personal in a group, even if it's not directly affecting you, not showing support can be hurtful. The author's statement \"you can do what you want unless it affects me\" could come off as not caring about Momoe's feelings or her identity. It might imply that the author only cares about their own interests (like their crush) and not the friend's well-being. \n\nAlso, the author didn't believe that asexual people don't have sexual urges, which shows a lack of understanding of what asexuality entails. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. It's not about making a choice, which is a common misconception. The author's skepticism might contribute to their dismissive attitude. \n\nBy not engaging or showing support, the author might have made Momoe feel excluded or invalidated. Even if the author didn't want to comment, not having a supportive response in a situation where others are supportive can be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. The friend's anger stems from feeling judged or not accepted, even if the author didn't directly criticize. \n\nIn social situations, when others show support, it's expected that you at least acknowledge the person's feelings. The author's response of staying neutral unless it affects them could be perceived as not valuing Momoe's experience. It's possible the author prioritized their own position (staying neutral) over supporting a friend, which is why Momoe felt targeted. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might have been hurtful even if they didn't intend to be. The key points are the lack of support, misunderstanding of asexuality, and the response given to Momoe. Therefore, the author might be at fault here.\n"
