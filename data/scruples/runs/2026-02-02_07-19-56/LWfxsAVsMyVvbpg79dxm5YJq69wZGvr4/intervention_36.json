One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation is that the author was part of a group where a friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The author didn't engage or show much interest, remained quiet, and when asked, responded that they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry, calling the author a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality entails. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. It's not a choice and is a valid identity. The author seems skeptical about Momoe's asexuality, thinking she might not actually lack sexual urges. That skepticism could be problematic because questioning someone's identity is not okay unless there's clear evidence of something being a choice or a phase, which isn't the case here.\n\nThe author's response to Momoe's coming out was dismissive. Staying silent and then giving a nonchalant \"you can do what you want\" might not be supportive. Even if the author didn't have strong feelings either way, the way they handled it could come off as indifferent or even disrespectful. Momoe felt judged or not respected, leading to her anger. The author's approach of not engaging and then being noncommittal might have made Momoe feel invalidated.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they didn't want to judge since it doesn't affect them. However, not engaging in a supportive way when someone shares something personal can still be hurtful. Being an ally often involves listening and showing empathy, even if you don't fully understand or agree. The author's lack of support could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment, even unintentionally.\n\nThe key points here are the author's skepticism about Momoe's identity, their dismissive response, and the resulting hurt. The author might not have intended to be bigoted, but their actions and words did harm Momoe. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
