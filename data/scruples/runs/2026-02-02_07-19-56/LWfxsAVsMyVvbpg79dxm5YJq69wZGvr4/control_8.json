One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author was trying to get closer to their crush and ended up befriending the crush's friends. One of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The author's friends immediately support her, but the author doesn't say much and just stays quiet. When Momoe asks the author's opinion, they respond by saying they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry and calls them a bigot. The author is now questioning if they are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality entails. Being asexual means someone does not experience sexual attraction. It's a valid sexual orientation, just like others. The author seems confused between someone choosing not to have sex versus not feeling sexual urges. That confusion might be part of the issue.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But in this context, when a friend shares a personal aspect of their identity, not responding in a supportive way can be seen as dismissive or insensitive. Even if the author doesn't have strong feelings about it, their reaction might come off as uncaring or judgmental, especially if they didn't express support when others did.\n\nThe key points here are the author's immediate response and their attitude. By not engaging when others showed support and then giving a neutral, almost indifferent response when asked, the author may have failed to show the empathy that Momoe expected. Even if the author isn't trying to be judgmental, their behavior could be perceived as not respecting Momoe's feelings or the significance of her coming out.\n\nAdditionally, the author admits they don't care, which isn't the same as being supportive. In a friendship, especially when someone is vulnerable, a more considerate response would be to acknowledge their feelings, even if the author isn't personally affected. The author's statement about not caring unless it affects them might be seen as prioritizing their own feelings over Momoe's emotional needs in that moment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author didn't mean to be bigoted, their actions and words might have hurt Momoe. The expectation in a friendship is often mutual respect and support, so the author's lack of supportive response could indeed be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
