One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation they described. The question is about whether the author's response to their friend coming out as asexual was appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author was part of a group of friends, but they were initially there to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the crush's friends, including Momoe. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the author's crush and another girl support her. The author, however, didn't react and stayed quiet, not showing much care. When Momoe asks what the author thinks, they respond with something like \"you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me.\" Momoe gets angry and calls the author a bigot. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reaction and their reasoning. The author didn't believe Momoe's claim about not feeling sexual urges and thought it wasn't their place to comment unless it affected them. The issue is the author's response and whether it was dismissive or harmful.\n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's important to note that people's experiences can vary, and some might not feel any sexual urges, while others might still experience them but choose not to act on them. However, the author's reaction was to say they don't care unless it affects them. That can come off as invalidating, even if they didn't mean to. When someone comes out, even if it's about something that doesn't directly involve you, a neutral or indifferent response might hurt them, especially if other friends are supportive. The author didn't express support or acknowledge Momoe's feelings, which could make the friend feel isolated or judged.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation for being in the group was to get close to a crush, which might have influenced their level of engagement. But once they became friends with Momoe, their response shouldn't be based on their initial reason for being there. The way the author responded could be seen as not taking the coming out moment seriously, which is a form of bigotry even if unintended. The author's belief that they should stay out of it if it doesn't affect them is problematic because supporting a friend's identity isn't about personal impact but about respecting their autonomy and feelings.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their response was dismissive and invalidated their friend's experience. They should have offered support and affirmed Momoe's identity instead of making it about their own lack of concern.\n"
