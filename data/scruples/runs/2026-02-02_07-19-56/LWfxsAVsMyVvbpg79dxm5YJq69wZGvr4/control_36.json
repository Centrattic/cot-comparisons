One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush. The friend Momoe came out as asexual. The crush and others were supportive. The author is confused about what asexuality means\u2014whether it's a choice to not have sex or a lack of sexual urges. The author didn't believe Momoe when she said she doesn't have sexual urges. The author stayed quiet, didn't express concern, and when asked, said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called the author a bigot. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. Asexuality is an inherent part of someone's identity. People who are asexual don't experience sexual attraction, which is different from choosing to not have sex. The author's misunderstanding suggests a lack of knowledge or respect for asexuality. By not expressing support and instead remaining indifferent, the author may have been dismissive. When Momoe asked for the author's opinion, the response was nonchalant, which could be seen as invalidating her experience. The author's attitude might come off as insensitive, even if they didn't intend to be. \n\nHowever, the author's position is that if something doesn't affect them, they stay out of it. But in friendships, especially when someone shares something personal, expecting support is reasonable. The author's lack of engagement could be seen as not respecting Momoe's feelings or the importance of her coming out. Additionally, the author's disbelief in Momoe's asexuality (assuming she's not telling the truth) is problematic because it's not the author's place to question someone's self-identified orientation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when a friend comes out with something personal, even if you don't fully understand or agree, showing respect and support is expected. The author's response\u2014saying they don't care unless it affects them\u2014might be hurtful and could be considered insensitive. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't support their friend and possibly invalidated her identity. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
