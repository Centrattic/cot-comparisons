One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author not caring when their friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The author was sitting with a group of friends because they wanted to get closer to their crush, and ended up being friends with her friends. Then, when Momoe announced she's asexual, the other friends were supportive, but the author didn't react much. The author didn't know if asexuality meant not having sex or not feeling sexual urges. They thought Momoe was lying about not having urges and decided not to comment because they didn't want to judge. When asked, the author responded neutrally, which made Momoe angry, calling them a bigot.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respecting someone's identity and the appropriate response when someone comes out. The author's stance was that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But is that the right approach? Well, when someone shares something personal, especially their identity, expecting others to acknowledge it is reasonable. The author's lack of reaction and the comment about not caring unless it affects them could be perceived as dismissive or indifferent. \n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's belief that Momoe was lying about not having urges shows a misunderstanding or skepticism towards asexuality, which is not a valid reason to doubt someone's identity. The author's response, while not overtly hostile, might have come off as uncaring. Even if they don't have strong feelings about it, the way they reacted could have hurt Momoe's feelings, especially since she was vulnerable in sharing her identity.\n\nAlso, the author's initial reason for being friends with Momoe (to get closer to their crush) might have contributed to a lack of genuine connection, making their indifference more noticeable. The friends around them were supportive, so the author's neutral stance without support could have been seen as out of place. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone comes out, it's generally expected to offer some level of support or acknowledgment, even if you're not close to them. The author's response of \"you can do what you want\" is technically non-judgmental, but the follow-up about not caring unless it affects them might have been the trigger. Momoe felt disrespected, leading her to call the author a bigot, which is a strong term, but maybe in the heat of the moment, she felt disrespected.\n\nSo, the author's actions were not malicious, but their lack of empathy and misunderstanding of asexuality could have been hurtful. They should have taken the opportunity to express support, even if they didn't fully understand it. The author is partly at fault for not being more considerate in their response.\n"
