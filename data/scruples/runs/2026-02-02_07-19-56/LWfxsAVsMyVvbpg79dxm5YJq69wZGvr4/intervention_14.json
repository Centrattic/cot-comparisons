One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The author met their friend while trying to get closer to their crush and later became friends. When the friend came out as asexual, the others were supportive, but the author didn't engage. The friend asked the author's opinion, and the author responded that they wouldn't care unless it affected them, leading the friend to feel targeted.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what asexuality entails. Asexual people experience little or no sexual attraction. It's a valid sexual orientation, just like others. The author's response was to say they don't care unless it affects them. That could come off as dismissive or indifferent. Even if the author didn't have any intention to be hurtful, not engaging and then responding with a neutral but non-supportive statement might be seen as not respecting the friend's feelings.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But in a close group where others are supportive, the author's lack of engagement could make the friend feel isolated. The friend felt accused of being a bigot, which isn't fair, but the author's approach might have contributed to that feeling. \n\nA good friend would at least acknowledge the friend's experience and offer support. The author didn't believe the friend's experience, which is problematic because asexuality is a real and valid identity. Dismissing it based on personal beliefs about human nature isn't appropriate. The author's response might have been hurtful even if they meant to stay neutral.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions and words might have been inconsiderate. They should have approached the situation with more empathy and openness, even if they didn't fully understand or agree with the friend's experience. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
