One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation is that the author was part of a group where a friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The author didn't believe that someone could genuinely not have sexual urges and chose to remain silent, only commenting when asked, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what asexuality means. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction to others. It's a valid identity, and it's not about making a choice to abstain from sex, but rather a lack of inherent sexual desire. So the author's misunderstanding here is the key point.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But in this case, Momoe came out, and the author's dismissive attitude made the friend feel judged. The author didn't express support, which might be seen as insensitive. Even if the author didn't want to engage, their response when asked was to say they don't care unless it affects them. This could be perceived as bigoted because it's invalidating Momoe's identity.\n\nAlso, the author's initial belief that asexuality isn't real (thinking people can't not have sexual urges) shows a lack of understanding. The author didn't take the time to educate themselves, which contributed to the conflict. The fact that the author was in the group to get closer to their crush might imply they didn't form a genuine connection with Momoe, so their indifference might come off as uncaring.\n\nHowever, the author didn't spread any negative comments or mock Momoe. They just stayed neutral. But neutrality in situations where someone is vulnerable can sometimes be harmful if it's perceived as indifference. The problem here is that the author's response when confronted was dismissive and potentially hurtful.\n\nSo, while the author didn't act maliciously, their lack of support and misunderstanding of asexuality led to the friend feeling judged. The author's stance might be seen as wrong because it's important to respect others' identities even if you don't fully understand them. The answer would lean towards AITA being A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions, while not hostile, were dismissive and contributed to the friend's feeling of being bigoted against.\n"
