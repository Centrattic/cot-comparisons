One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring about their friend being asexual. The situation is that the author was sitting with a group of friends to get closer to their crush. One of their friends, Momoe, came out as asexual. The other friends supported her, but the author didn't engage much. They didn't express any judgment but also didn't show support. When asked, the author said they wouldn't care unless it affected them, which led to Momoe getting angry and calling them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's stance is that they don't believe Momoe's asexuality and think it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. Momoe feels hurt and sees the author's neutrality as bigotry. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nAsexuality is an orientation where a person experiences little to no sexual attraction. It's a valid and recognized identity. The author's problem seems to be their disbelief in Momoe's asexuality and their decision to stay silent. The problem here is that the author's lack of engagement and their subsequent comment might come off as dismissive or uncaring, even if they intended to be neutral.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone comes out about their identity, especially in a group setting, it's important to show some level of support or at least acknowledge their statement. The author's response of \"you can do what you want as long as it doesn't affect me\" can be seen as transactional and not affirming. It might imply that the author only cares about their own interests and doesn't value Momoe's identity unless it directly impacts them.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they didn't express any judgment and remained neutral. But neutrality in such contexts can sometimes be harmful if it's perceived as indifference or a lack of support. The line between being respectful and being dismissive is thin here. Since Momoe felt targeted and called the author a bigot, there's a valid emotional impact.\n\nAnother angle is the author's initial motivation for sitting with the group\u2014to get closer to their crush. This could suggest that the author didn't form genuine friendships, which might explain why their reaction was so different from the others. The crush and her friend immediately offered support, while the author's response was more detached. This difference in reaction could contribute to Momoe feeling isolated or unsupported by the author.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's belief that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment, might be a personal choice, but in social interactions, especially among friends, showing empathy and support is often expected. The author's lack of engagement in this moment of vulnerability for Momoe might be seen as a failure to be a good friend.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author's actions could be perceived as wrong because they didn't show support when a friend came out, which is a significant and personal moment. Even if they didn't express judgment, their silence and subsequent comments were hurtful. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
