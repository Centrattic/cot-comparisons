One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a friend coming out as asexual and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author was part of a group of friends, became friends with others while trying to get closer to their crush. Their friend Momoe came out as asexual. The crush and other friend supported her, but the author didn't express any opinion initially. When asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, leading Momoe to call them a bigot. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nKey points: The author didn't express support when others did. They remained silent and then gave a dismissive response when asked. They also didn't believe Momoe's asexuality. Asexuality is a valid orientation where one doesn't experience sexual attraction. Dismissing someone's identity, even if you don't believe it, can be hurtful. The author's response of \"you can do what you want unless it affects me\" might come off as uncaring or invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to stay neutral, not supporting a friend's important personal matter can be seen as insensitive. The friend felt accused of being a bigot, which suggests the response was hurtful. So, the author's lack of support and dismissive attitude likely hurt Momoe's feelings, making them at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
