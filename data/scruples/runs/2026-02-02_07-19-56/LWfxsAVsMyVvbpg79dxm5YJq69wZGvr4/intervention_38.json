One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author was part of a group of friends, and one friend (Momoe) came out as asexual. The author didn't really know what asexuality meant and didn't believe that Momoe didn't feel any sexual urges. They stayed quiet because they thought it wasn't their place to comment unless it affected them. When asked, they responded that they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them, and Momoe got angry, calling them a bigot. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where a person doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's valid and not a choice. The author seems to have misunderstood it as a decision to not have sex rather than an inherent lack of attraction. That's a key point. If the author believed Momoe was faking or not genuine, that's a problem because it shows a lack of respect for her identity.\n\nThe author's response was to stay silent and then say they don't care unless it affects them. This could come off as dismissive or not taking Momoe's identity seriously. Even if the author wasn't directly involved or affected, their reaction might have made Momoe feel invalidated. The fact that she got angry and called them a bigot suggests that the author's response was hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's initial motivation for sitting with the group was to get closer to their crush, which might have contributed to a lack of genuine connection with Momoe. The author's nonchalant attitude in this situation could be seen as not supporting a friend during a vulnerable moment.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone comes out, the appropriate response is usually one of support and acceptance. The author's response was the opposite, which could be considered insensitive. Even if they didn't fully understand asexuality, they could have been more supportive or asked questions instead of making a dismissive comment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions\u2014remaining silent and then making a non-supportive comment\u2014likely caused hurt. They didn't validate Momoe's experience and instead reacted in a way that could be seen as judgmental. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
