One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not caring when their friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The author didn't engage in the conversation initially, stayed quiet, and when asked for their opinion, responded neutrally. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what asexuality entails. Asexual people experience little or no sexual attraction, or they might not feel sexual desire. It's a valid identity, just like any other. The key here is the author's reaction. They didn't express support, but also didn't mock or criticize. They remained neutral. However, the author admitted they didn't believe Momoe and thought it didn't affect them, so they stayed out of it.\n\nThe issue is whether the author's neutrality was appropriate. In a group setting where others are showing support, the author's silence and indifferent response might be seen as dismissive or uncaring. Even if the author wasn't trying to be judgmental, their reaction could still hurt Momoe. Coming out is a personal and vulnerable act, so a supportive reaction is usually expected. By not engaging and giving a neutral, almost detached response, the author might have unintentionally hurt Momoe's feelings.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it doesn't affect them, so they shouldn't comment. But when a friend shares something personal, the right approach is to be supportive, not just neutral. Not showing support can be perceived as bigotry or indifference. The author's response of \"you can do what you want unless it affects me\" implies that they only care about the impact on themselves, which isn't considerate of the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't actively oppose Momoe's identity, their lack of support and the indifferent attitude could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's actions might have contributed to Momoe feeling invalidated. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being supportive and for reacting in a way that implied apathy towards their friend's personal identity.\n"
