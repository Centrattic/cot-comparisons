One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not showing interest when their friend came out as asexual. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group to get closer to their crush and ended up befriending others, including Momoe. When Momoe came out as asexual, the crush and another friend were supportive. But the author didn't engage and stayed quiet, even when asked. Then Momoe got upset, calling them a bigot.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't understand asexuality well\u2014confusing it with not having sexual desires versus just not wanting to have sex. They thought it didn't affect them, so they stayed out of it. But by not responding supportively, they might have come off as dismissive or indifferent. \n\nEven though the author didn't mean to be judgmental, their reaction still hurt Momoe. Not engaging and giving a neutral response (\"you can do what you want unless it affects me\") could be seen as not valuing her feelings. Support in friendships often matters, even if you don't fully understand. So, the author might be in the wrong for not showing empathy, even if they thought they were staying neutral. \n\nBut the question is whether they're at fault. Since they ignored the friend's significant personal moment and didn't offer support, which led to hurt feelings, it's likely they are in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
