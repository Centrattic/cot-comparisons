One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author was sitting with a group of friends because they wanted to get closer to their crush. One of the friends, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends immediately support her. The author, however, is unsure what being asexual really means\u2014whether it's a choice to not have sex or if they don't feel any sexual urges. The author didn't believe Momoe when she said she never has sexual urges. The author decided to stay quiet, not wanting to comment since they didn't think it was their place. When Momoe asked for their opinion, the author said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called the author a bigot.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around respecting someone's identity. Coming out as asexual is a personal matter, and respecting that is important. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them might be seen as dismissive or not taking the disclosure seriously. Even if the author had doubts about the meaning of asexuality, it's not their place to question or invalidate someone's self-identification. By staying silent and then giving a neutral, perhaps indifferent response, the author might have made Momoe feel unsupported, especially when she sought a reaction. \n\nAlso, the author's initial doubts about whether asexuality involves lack of sexual urges versus a choice could stem from a misunderstanding. However, instead of addressing that misunderstanding privately or respectfully, they chose to remain silent and then express indifference. This could be perceived as disrespectful or non-supportive. \n\nIn social interactions, when someone shares a personal aspect of their identity, the appropriate response is usually one of support and acceptance, even if one doesn't fully understand. The author's response, while not overtly negative, lacks empathy and support, which can be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they didn't mean to be judgmental and that they were staying out of it to avoid overstepping. However, in many cases, active support is expected when someone comes out, even if one is not entirely sure. The author's silence and then the indifferent comment could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment for Momoe. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions and response could be considered inconsiderate and not supportive, which might place them in the wrong. The key points are the invalidation of Momoe's identity through doubt, the lack of a supportive response, and the subsequent comment that could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
