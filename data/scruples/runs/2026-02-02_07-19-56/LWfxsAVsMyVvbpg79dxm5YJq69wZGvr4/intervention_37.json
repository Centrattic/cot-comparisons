One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not reacting when a friend comes out as asexual. The author was part of a group where others were supportive, but they remained silent and indifferent. The friend then got angry, calling the author a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what asexuality means. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction. It's a valid and recognized part of the spectrum of human sexuality. The person coming out as asexual, Momoe, likely felt vulnerable sharing this, so the support from friends is important.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since their friend's asexuality doesn't affect them, they don't need to comment. They stayed quiet and didn't express any judgment. But when asked directly, they responded with a dismissive attitude, saying they don't care unless it affects them. The friend got upset, feeling judged or disrespected.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author didn't engage in supportive behavior. While they didn't actively mock or insult Momoe, their silence and indifference could be seen as lacking empathy. The other friends were supportive, so the author's response might have stood out negatively. Even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, their reaction could still come off as dismissive or uncaring, which can hurt someone who's opening up about their identity.\n\nIs it wrong to not care? Well, in social contexts, being respectful and supportive is expected, especially when others are sharing personal information. The author's response might not be a direct attack, but it can still contribute to a hurtful environment by not acknowledging the importance of the friend's identity. The author's belief that they shouldn't comment because it doesn't affect them ignores the social dynamics and the emotional impact on the friend.\n\nAlso, the author's doubt about whether asexual people actually don't have any sexual urges shows a lack of understanding. Even if they didn't voice that doubt, their internal skepticism combined with their dismissive response might have contributed to the friend feeling invalidated. The author's indifference, in this case, doesn't align with what's typically considered supportive behavior in such situations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their response could have been perceived as bigoted or at least unsupportive, even if they didn't intend it. The friend's reaction is valid because people often seek support and acceptance when sharing such personal information. The author's silence and subsequent dismissive comment failed to provide that support, which is a social expectation in many contexts.\n"
