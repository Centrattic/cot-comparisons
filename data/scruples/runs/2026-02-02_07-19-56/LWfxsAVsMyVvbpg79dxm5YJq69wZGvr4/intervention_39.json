One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation involves the author being part of a group where a friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The author didn't express support or engage in the conversation, leading Momoe to feel judged and call them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was trying to get closer to a crush and made friends with her friends. When Momoe came out as asexual, others were supportive, but the author remained quiet. The author thought about whether asexuality means no sexual urges or just choosing not to have sex. They decided not to comment, thinking it's not their place unless it affects them. Momoe then confronts them, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they didn't act judgmentally, just stayed silent. They didn't try to correct Momoe or make negative statements. However, their silence might have been perceived as indifference or lack of support. The author's reasoning was that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But in social contexts, especially when someone is vulnerable in sharing a personal aspect of their identity, silence can sometimes be seen as not supporting or not respecting their experience.\n\nFrom Momoe's side, coming out can be a significant moment. If others are supportive, and the author is silent, it might make Momoe feel excluded or unheard. Even if the author didn't mean to, their silence could be hurtful. The key here is understanding that being an ally sometimes requires more than just not being actively negative\u2014it involves actively supporting and affirming others' identities, especially when they share personal information.\n\nThe author's statement that they don't care unless it affects them might come off as dismissive. Asexuality is a valid identity, and while the author might not be directly affected, the act of acknowledging and supporting a friend's identity is important for maintaining respect and trust in a relationship. The author's lack of engagement, especially when asked directly, could be seen as a failure to be a supportive friend.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't make negative comments, their silence and nonchalant response could be considered inconsiderate. The question is whether staying silent in this context is morally acceptable. Since the author was part of the group where others were supportive, their silence might contribute to a less inclusive environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not showing support and for their dismissive attitude, even if they meant no harm.\n"
