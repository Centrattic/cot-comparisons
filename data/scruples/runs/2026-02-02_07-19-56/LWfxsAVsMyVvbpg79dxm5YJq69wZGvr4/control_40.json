One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that their friend Momoe came out as asexual. The author's crush and another friend immediately said they wouldn't judge her. But the author doesn't really care either way and stays quiet. Momoe notices and asks what the author thinks, so they respond that they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry and calls them a bigot. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexual people typically experience little or no sexual attraction to others. It's a valid orientation, not a choice. The author seems confused, thinking it might mean a choice to not have sex, which is a misconception. That's a problem because it shows a lack of understanding.\n\nThe author didn't react when Momoe came out, which could be seen as indifferent. When asked directly, they said they don't care unless it affects them. That's pretty dismissive. Even if they don't personally care, being a friend should involve some level of acceptance and support. Dismissing someone's identity, even if you don't affect you, can be hurtful. The author's response might make Momoe feel invalidated or not accepted as a friend.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't say anything. But in a friendship, it's important to be supportive and show empathy, even if you don't understand or feel a connection. The author's attitude could be seen as a lack of respect for Momoe's identity. The fact that they didn't try to engage or show interest in understanding her experience is a red flag.\n\nThe key points here are the author's lack of support, the dismissive comment, and the misunderstanding of asexuality. These actions likely hurt Momoe's feelings, making the author at fault. So the answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
