One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend (Momoe) coming out as asexual, and the author not responding with support, instead staying quiet and later giving a non-committal response when asked. The friend then gets angry and calls them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where a person does not experience sexual attraction. It's a valid and recognized orientation. The key here is that the author didn't believe Momoe when she said she didn't feel sexual urges. The author's internal belief is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. However, when Momoe confronted them, the author's response was dismissive, which upset her.\n\nThe author's mistake lies in their approach. Even if they didn't understand or believe Momoe's experience, the right thing to do would be to listen and support her, especially since she was sharing something personal. By not engaging and giving a cold response, the author showed a lack of empathy and respect. The friend felt judged or not accepted, which is why she got angry. The author's reasoning about staying out of it if it doesn't affect them is flawed here because being a supportive friend isn't about personal impact but about showing respect and acceptance regardless of personal beliefs. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
