One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation is that the author was trying to get closer to a crush and ended up befriending her friends. One friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends support her, but the author didn't engage much, stayed quiet, and when asked, said they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe got angry, calling the author a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexuality is an orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's a valid identity, and people might have varying levels of experience with sexual feelings. The author is confused about whether asexuality means no urges at all or just a choice not to have sex. The author's doubt might stem from not fully understanding the concept, which could lead to dismissive behavior.\n\nThe author's response was to stay quiet and when confronted, say they don't care unless it affects them. This comes off as indifferent or uncaring. The key here is respect for others' identities. Even if the author doesn't fully understand or agree, reacting with silence and a dismissive attitude can be hurtful. By not engaging or showing support, the author might be seen as not valuing Momoe's identity. The author's belief that it's not their place to comment unless it affects them might be a personal stance, but in friendships, showing support often matters more than personal beliefs.\n\nThe author's confusion isn't an excuse for their reaction. It's important to educate oneself on others' identities and show respect. The fact that the author didn't try to engage or ask questions but instead remained silent and indifferent could be seen as lacking empathy. Momoe felt judged or not supported, which is a valid reaction. The author's response that they don't care unless it affects them can be perceived as reducing the importance of someone else's personal identity, which is a form of bigotry or lack of support.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, their actions and words were dismissive. They should have taken the opportunity to express support or at least show openness to understanding. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their response wasn't respectful or supportive of their friend's identity, even if they had misunderstandings.\n"
