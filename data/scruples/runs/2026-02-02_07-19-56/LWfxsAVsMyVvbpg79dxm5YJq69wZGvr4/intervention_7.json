One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not reacting in a way that the friend found acceptable.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of girls to get closer to their crush and ended up being friends with the others. When one friend, Momoe, mentions she's asexual, the crush and another girl immediately support her. The author, however, didn't respond and stayed quiet. When asked, the author says they don't care unless it affects them, leading Momoe to accuse them of being a bigot.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's attitude towards asexuality. The author seems skeptical, thinking that asexual people don't have any sexual urges, which might not be accurate because asexuality can vary (some may have low sexual desire but not none). The author's nonchalant response and lack of support could come off as dismissive or indifferent. Even if the author wasn't trying to be judgmental, their reaction might have been hurtful. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't care unless it affects them. But in a friendship, supporting each other through personal disclosures, even if you don't fully understand or relate, is important. Not engaging or appearing indifferent can make the friend feel unsupported. The author didn't show empathy or curiosity, which could be seen as a lack of respect for Momoe's experience.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that they don't care unless it affects them might be seen as a form of bigotry because it's not acknowledging the significance of Momoe's identity. Bigotry isn't always about active hatred; it can also be about not respecting others' differences and not showing support. The friend was vulnerable by coming out, and the author's response could have made her feel invalidated.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, their response was dismissive and hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
