One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not reacting, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was at lunch with a group, trying to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the group. When Momoe came out as asexual, the crush and others supported her. The author, however, didn't believe her and thought asexuality might just be a decision not to have sex, not a lack of sexual urges. The author remained silent, didn't express care, and when asked, responded neutrally, leading Momoe to accuse them of being a bigot.\n\nNow, considering the ethics of the situation. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's skepticism about whether Momoe actually feels no sexual urges is problematic. Assuming someone isn't genuine about their identity because it doesn't align with their understanding is disrespectful. The author's response of staying neutral unless it affects them might seem like non-interference, but in this context, it's dismissive. When Momoe asked for their opinion, the author's answer could be perceived as indifferent or not validating her experience. \n\nAlso, the author's initial reason for being there (to get closer to their crush) might have influenced their attitude. They might not have been fully invested in the friendship, leading to a lack of genuine support. The key issue is the author's disbelief and the subsequent dismissive response, which could hurt Momoe and make her feel unsupported. \n\nIn terms of social norms and respect, being asexual is a personal identity that deserves acknowledgment and respect without judgment. The author's reaction, even if they meant no harm, could be seen as invalidating Momoe's experience. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
