One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual and the author not reacting much. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author was in a group where a friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The other friends, including the author's crush, supported her. The author, however, didn't express much, just stayed quiet and said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe then got angry, calling the author a bigot. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about respect and acceptance. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's response was to remain neutral, not engaging in the discussion and stating they don't care unless it affects them. But by not offering support or positive reinforcement, the author might have come across as dismissive or indifferent. Even if the author didn't have a strong opinion, their silence and the comment about not caring could be hurtful. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But in social contexts, especially when someone is sharing a personal aspect of their identity, the appropriate response is usually to be supportive, even if you don't have much to say. The fact that the author didn't act like they cared might have been perceived as not respecting Momoe's feelings or her coming out experience. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned doubting Momoe's claim about not having sexual urges. That could indicate a lack of understanding or belief in her identity, which is problematic. Even if the author's intentions were to stay neutral, the effect on Momoe was negative. The author's response of \"you can do what you want\" sounds dismissive and not supportive. \n\nIn such situations, it's important to validate the person's experience, even if you don't fully understand it. The author's silence and the subsequent comment might have made Momoe feel unsupported or judged, especially since others in the group were more vocal in their support. The accusation of being a bigot could stem from feeling that the author was indifferent or disrespectful. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely at fault here because their response, while perhaps an attempt to stay neutral, failed to provide the support and positive affirmation that someone in Momoe's position might need. The author's lack of engagement and dismissive comment could be seen as not respecting her feelings and personal identity, which is a valid concern.\n"
