One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring when a friend came out as asexual. The situation involves the author sitting with a group of friends to get closer to a crush and making friends along the way. When one friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual, others support her, but the author remains quiet and indifferent. The author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. However, when asked, the author gives a neutral response that Momoe takes as judgmental, leading to her anger and accusations of bigotry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of asexuality. Asexual individuals experience little to no sexual attraction. The author is unsure about the definition, which might indicate a lack of understanding or sensitivity. The author's initial reaction is to stay silent and not engage, thinking it's not their place to comment. But when confronted, the author responds with a dismissive statement about not caring unless it affects them. This could be perceived as indifferent or even discriminatory, as it dismisses the importance of the friend's personal identity.\n\nThe key points here are the author's response and the context of their relationship. The author was in a group where others were supportive, but the author chose not to engage, possibly out of ignorance or apathy. The friend felt judged when the author didn't offer support, even if the author didn't intend to. The author's statement \"you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me\" might seem neutral, but in reality, it can come off as not valuing the friend's feelings or identity. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being supportive of a friend's identity, even if one doesn't fully understand it, is generally expected. The author's lack of engagement and the dismissive response could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author's intention was to stay out of it, not offering support in a situation where others are doing so might be seen as contributing to a less inclusive environment. The author's answer could be interpreted as minimizing the significance of the friend's coming out, which is a personal and vulnerable moment.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were staying neutral and not being judgmental. But neutrality in this context might not be the same as being supportive. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's response was hurtful. The author's confusion about the definition of asexuality also points to a lack of prior knowledge, which might have been addressed by educating themselves or asking questions instead of making assumptions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have intended to be a bigot, their response was dismissive and failed to provide the support that Momoe expected. The author's indifference in a situation where others were supportive could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their response was perceived as judgmental and unsupportive, even if unintentionally.\n"
