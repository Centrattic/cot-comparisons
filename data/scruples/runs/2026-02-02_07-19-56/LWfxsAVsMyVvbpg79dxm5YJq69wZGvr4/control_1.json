One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush. The friend Momoe came out as asexual. The crush and others supported her, but the author didn't react. The author thought being asexual meant either not having sex or not feeling sexual urges. They didn't believe Momoe when she said she has no urges. The author decided not to comment, thinking it wasn't their place. When asked, they said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry, calling them a bigot. Now, the user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nHmm, asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive because they didn't engage or support, just stayed neutral. Even if they don't personally care, the friend might have expected some acknowledgment or support. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them could be hurtful. It's possible the author didn't understand asexuality correctly, thinking it's about choice rather than orientation. By not engaging, they might have invalidated Momoe's feelings. So, the author's inconsiderate response likely made Momoe feel judged, hence the anger. The key here is about respecting others' identities without needing to affect oneself. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide the support their friend needed, even if they didn't want to interfere otherwise.\n"
