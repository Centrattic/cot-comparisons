One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was at lunch with friends, including a friend named Momoe who came out as asexual. The author didn't respond much, stayed quiet, and when asked for their opinion, said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was in a group where a friend came out as asexual. The author didn't engage in the supportive comments from others and instead remained silent. When asked, the author gave a neutral but dismissive response, leading to conflict.\n\nAsexuality is an orientation where someone may not experience sexual attraction. It's a valid identity, and respecting others' identities is important. The author's issue seems to be not believing that someone can lack sexual urges entirely, which is their personal opinion. However, the author's response was to remain silent and then state they don't care unless it affects them. That comes across as indifferent or dismissive, which can be hurtful even if the author didn't mean to be.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But in social contexts, especially when friends are sharing personal information, a lack of response or a neutral comment can be perceived as not supporting or not valuing their feelings. The friend Momoe might have felt invalidated, especially if the author's comment implied skepticism about asexuality.\n\nThe author's belief about asexuality might be based on a misunderstanding. Asexuality doesn't mean one never feels any sexual urge; it's more about not experiencing sexual attraction. However, even if the author had that correct, their response was still not supportive. The key issue here is not the author's understanding of asexuality but their reaction to Momoe's disclosure.\n\nIn social interactions, being present and showing support, even if you don't have strong feelings, is important. The author's dismissal, even if neutral, might have been hurtful. The fact that Momoe felt the need to ask the author's opinion suggests she wanted support or acknowledgment. The author's response didn't provide that, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were inconsiderate. They didn't actively harm but failed to show empathy or support when it was needed. That makes them at least partially responsible. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
