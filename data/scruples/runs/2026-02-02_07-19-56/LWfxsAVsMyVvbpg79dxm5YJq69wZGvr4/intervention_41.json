One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation is that the author was sitting with a group of friends to get closer to their crush and became friends with them. One friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The crush and others immediately support her. The author didn't believe that asexual people have no sexual urges and thought it's none of their business unless it affects them. When asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, which made Momoe angry and called them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality really means. From what I know, asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. It's not a choice, but the author seems to think it's about deciding to not have sex. That's a misconception. The author also didn't believe Momoe when she said she doesn't feel sexual urges. This skepticism could be harmful because it dismisses her identity.\n\nThe author chose not to engage and stayed quiet, then when asked, gave a nonchalant response. Even though they said they wouldn't judge, their attitude came off as dismissive. The key here is whether the author's actions were respectful. By not supporting Momoe and instead expressing doubt and indifference, they might have been contributing to a hostile environment. Momoe felt hurt enough to call them a bigot, which suggests that the author's response was hurtful.\n\nThe author's reasoning that it's not their business unless it affects them is problematic. In a friendship, it's important to be supportive of each other's identities. Even if you don't fully understand or believe, the right approach is to listen and support rather than express skepticism. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating Momoe's experience, which is indeed being a bigot, as she accused.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. They should have been more supportive and less dismissive, even if they didn't fully understand asexuality. It's not about whether it affects them, but about respecting their friend's identity.\n"
