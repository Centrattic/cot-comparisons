One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring when their friend came out as asexual. The author was trying to get closer to a crush and ended up befriending her friends. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the other friends are supportive, but the author remains quiet and doesn't engage. When asked, the author responds by saying they won't care unless it affects them, leading Momoe to get angry and call them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author didn't express support or ask questions when Momoe came out. They stayed silent and only said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe took offense and felt judged. The author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment, and they don't believe that asexuality means no sexual urges. They also mention not wanting to tell others what they are.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. When someone comes out, even if it's about their personal identity, it's usually seen as important to them. The author's response might be interpreted as dismissive or not validating. Even if the author didn't want to comment, a simple acknowledgment or support could have been better. The fact that the author didn't believe Momoe's statement about asexuality could imply a lack of understanding or acceptance, which might contribute to the conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude of \"staying out of it\" unless it affects them might seem indifferent. Even if they don't have an opinion, the act of not engaging and then being dismissive when asked could be seen as not respecting the friend's moment. The author's response might have made Momoe feel unsupported or judged, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they didn't mean to hurt anyone and just wanted to stay neutral. But in social situations, especially when someone is being vulnerable, silence or neutral comments can sometimes be perceived as negative. The line between respecting privacy and showing support is thin here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions could be seen as contributing to the conflict. Even if they didn't mean to be a bigot, their response and lack of engagement might have been hurtful. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here. The answer would be A.\n"
