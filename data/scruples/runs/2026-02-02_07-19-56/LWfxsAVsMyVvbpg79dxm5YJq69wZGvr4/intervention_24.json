One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not reacting as the friend expected.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of girls at lunch, mainly to get closer to their crush and then became friends with her friends. Then one of them, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends (the crush and another girl) support her. The author, however, doesn't really care and stays quiet, not engaging in the support. When asked, the author says they don't care unless it affects them, which leads to the friend getting angry and calling them a bigot. The author is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA).\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't believe asexuality means no sexual urges and think it doesn't affect them, so they stay out of it. But they admit they didn't act caring when they really don't care. The question is whether this makes them wrong.\n\nHmm. Asexuality is an orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's a valid part of the spectrum. The author's response seems dismissive. Even if they think they don't need to comment, the fact that they didn't show any support or empathy when asked could be problematic. Their friend felt judged, which is a big deal. The author's statement about not caring unless it affects them might come off as uncaring or invalidating. It's important to respect others' identities, even if you don't fully understand or believe them. Dismissing someone's personal identity can hurt their feelings, so maybe the author is wrong for not showing more support and for being dismissive. So the answer is probably A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
