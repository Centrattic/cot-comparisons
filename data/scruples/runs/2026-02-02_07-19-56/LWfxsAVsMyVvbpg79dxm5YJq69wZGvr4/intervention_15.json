One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author not caring or responding in a way that made the friend upset.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of friends because they wanted to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the others, including Momoe. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the author's friends support her, but the author remains silent. The author didn't believe that Momoe actually doesn't feel any sexual urges and thought it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. When asked, the author gave a neutral response, which made Momoe angry and called them a bigot.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is at fault. Let me break it down.\n\nThe key points here are about respect, empathy, and appropriate social behavior. The author didn't express any judgment, but their lack of response and the statement \"you can do what you want as long as it doesn't affect me\" might be seen as dismissive. Even if the author didn't want to engage, their silence and the subsequent response could be hurtful. Momoe might have been seeking validation or support, and the author's indifference could be perceived as not caring, hence the anger.\n\nIn social situations, especially when someone is sharing personal information, a neutral or indifferent response can come across as uncaring. The author's belief that they shouldn't get involved unless it affects them might be their personal stance, but in reality, how we respond to others' personal disclosures affects our relationships. Even if the author didn't intend to be judgmental, the friend took it that way, leading to the conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's initial motivation for being in that group (to get closer to their crush) might have contributed to their lack of investment in the friendship, which could be a factor. However, the main issue here is their response to Momoe's coming out. Even if they don't personally care, the way they handled the situation\u2014staying silent and then giving a dismissive answer\u2014could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut wait, asexuality is an identity, and the author's doubt about whether Momoe truly feels that way might stem from a lack of understanding. However, questioning someone's identity, even silently, isn't appropriate. The author's lack of support could be harmful. Even if they don't share the same views, respecting someone's identity is important.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user is leaning towards A (author is wrong). I think the author's response was inconsiderate, even if they didn't actively criticize. Their indifference and the statement given when asked might have been hurtful. So, the answer would be A.\n"
