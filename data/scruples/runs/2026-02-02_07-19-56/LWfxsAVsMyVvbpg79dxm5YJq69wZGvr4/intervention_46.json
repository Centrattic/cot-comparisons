One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author was sitting with a group of girls, trying to get closer to their crush, and became friends with her friends. One of them, Momoe, came out as asexual. The author's crush and another friend immediately supported her. The author, however, didn't really engage. The author admits they didn't know if asexuality means just choosing not to have sex or not feeling any sexual urges. They thought Momoe was saying she never has urges and didn't believe that. The author decided to stay quiet, not trying to act like they care, and when asked, told Momoe they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. The author is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nSo, the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author didn't know much about asexuality. That's a starting point. But the key point here is their reaction. They chose not to engage, stayed quiet, and when confronted, gave a dismissive response. The author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But is silence and indifference in a situation like this considered appropriate?\n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation where a person doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's not a choice to not have sex, but rather a lack of sexual desire. The author's confusion here might stem from misunderstanding the term. When Momoe came out, the author's response was dismissive. Even if they were unsure, the proper response would be to acknowledge and respect her identity, even if they don't fully understand it. \n\nIn social situations, especially when someone comes out, the expected norm is to be supportive, even if you don't have much to add. Being silent can be seen as not engaging with her identity, which might make her feel invalidated. The author's response of \"you can do what you want unless it affects me\" is problematic because it frames her identity as something that could affect them, which it shouldn't. This might make Momoe feel like her identity is an issue the author has to tolerate rather than accepting her for who she is.\n\nAdditionally, the author's lack of empathy here is a problem. Even if they don't fully understand asexuality, reacting with indifference or making someone feel like their identity isn't important is hurtful. The fact that Momoe got angry and called them a bigot suggests that the author's response was indeed hurtful and disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions and words were inappropriate. They didn't support their friend during a vulnerable moment, showed a lack of understanding, and gave a dismissive response. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
