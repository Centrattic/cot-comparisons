One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not reacting when their friend comes out as asexual. The friend then gets angry, calling the author a bigot.\n\nFirst, the author was part of a group where a friend (Momoe) came out as asexual. The author didn't believe that asexual people don't have any sexual urges and stayed quiet, thinking it's not their place to comment. When asked, the author responded that they don't care unless it affects them, leading to conflict.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author's main concern is not feeling affected by the friend's sexuality, so they chose to stay neutral. However, their response of \"you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me\" might come off as dismissive or indifferent. Asexual individuals might feel that not acknowledging their identity or expressing support, even if not personally affected, could be seen as lacking empathy. The friend getting angry suggests that the author's approach was hurtful, even if unintentionally.\n\nAlso, the author's belief that if something doesn't affect them, they should stay out of it, might not account for the importance of social support and validation in someone's identity. Even if the author isn't part of the LGBTQ+ community, dismissing the significance of a friend's personal statement could be hurtful. The key here is whether the author's response was respectful and supportive enough. \n\nThe author didn't act maliciously but their words might have been insensitive. By not acknowledging the importance of Momoe's statement and instead implying indifference unless it affects them, it might be seen as a lack of care for the friend's feelings. So, the author is in the wrong because their response could be perceived as dismissive and not supportive, even if they didn't mean to be.\n"
