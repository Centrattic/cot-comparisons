One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about their friend being asexual. The situation is that the author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush. One of the friends, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The author's crush and another friend immediately support her, but the author remains quiet and doesn't express any judgment. When asked, the author says they don't care unless it affects them, which makes Momoe angry and calls them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality means. Asexual people may not experience sexual attraction, or have little to none. It's a valid sexual orientation, just like others. The author seems to misunderstand it, thinking it's about not having sexual urges rather than not feeling attraction. Also, the author's attitude is dismissive, not engaging in the conversation and only staying quiet, then making a neutral but indifferent comment when asked.\n\nThe key points here are the author's lack of engagement and their response. While it's true that not everyone has to have an opinion on someone else's sexuality, the dismissive attitude can come off as uncaring or judgmental. The author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they don't need to comment. However, in social situations, showing support and respect is important. By not engaging and making a indifferent comment, the author might have been perceived as not supporting Momoe, which could hurt her feelings. Even if the author didn't have negative intentions, the action can still be harmful because it's seen as a lack of empathy. So, the author's wrong isn't about the content of the answer but the lack of support in a moment where others were showing support. The author should have, at the very least, acknowledged the statement with support, even if they didn't fully understand it. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
