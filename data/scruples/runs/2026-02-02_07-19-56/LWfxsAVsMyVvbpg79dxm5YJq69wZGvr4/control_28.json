One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was hanging out with a group of friends, mostly because they wanted to get closer to their crush. One of the friends, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The author didn't really engage or respond much, stayed quiet, and when asked what they thought, said they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe then gets angry and calls them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality is. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction to others. It's not about making a choice to not have sex, but rather not feeling sexual desire. So if Momoe said she never gets sexual urges, that's her experience. The author is skeptical about that, not believing she doesn't have urges. But the author's main issue is that they don't really care about her orientation and didn't engage in the support others showed.\n\nThe key points here are the author's response and their attitude. The author's friends were supportive, but the author stayed silent and didn't show any support. When asked, they said they don't care unless it affects them. Then Momoe felt hurt and called them a bigot. The question is whether the author's reaction was wrong.\n\nAsexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and respecting someone's identity is important. The author didn't express judgment directly, but their indifference might come off as dismissive or not caring. By not engaging when others were supportive, maybe the author didn't show the solidarity Momoe might have expected from a friend. Also, when asked, the author's response was about their own lack of concern rather than affirming Momoe's identity. That could be seen as not supporting her, which might be hurtful.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't get involved. However, in friendships, people often value support and acceptance even when it doesn't affect them. Not responding when others are supporting a friend can be seen as not being a good ally, even if they're not being mean. The author's comment about not caring unless it affects them might imply that they don't value Momoe's identity, which could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't lie or mock Momoe. They just didn't show support. The problem might be that in a group where others are supportive, the author's silence and nonchalant response made Momoe feel isolated or unsupported. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of not forcing themselves to be supportive, but in a social context, friends often expect mutual support. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't show the support Momoe needed, even if it was their choice not to engage. \n\nAlso, the author's skepticism about Momoe's asexuality (\"I don't believe that\") might be problematic. Questioning someone's identity like that can be hurtful, even if it's not stated outright. The author's doubt could stem from a misunderstanding of asexuality, which is a common misconception. So perhaps the author's lack of knowledge and resulting indifferent attitude is why they're in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's lack of support and indifference, even if not directly hostile, could be seen as disrespectful or hurtful. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't show the support Momoe deserved, especially when she was vulnerable sharing her identity.\n"
