One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was part of a group of girls at lunch because they wanted to get closer to their crush. They became friends with the others. One friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends immediately say they won't judge. The author wasn't sure if asexuality meant no sexual urges or just a choice not to have sex. They didn't believe that Momoe had no sexual urges. The author thought if something doesn't affect them, they should stay out of it. So they stayed quiet and didn't show they cared. When Momoe asked for their opinion, the author said they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what asexuality entails. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone experiences little to no sexual attraction. It's not a choice, and the person doesn't have sexual urges, or they might have low ones. The author's belief that it's just a choice not to have sex is a misunderstanding. That's a key point here.\n\nThe author didn't express support when others did. They didn't confront their own misconceptions but instead stayed silent. When asked, they gave a dismissive response. Momoe felt hurt and called them a bigot. The author's response implies that they don't care unless it affects them, which can come off as indifferent or not taking the situation seriously.\n\nNow, being in a group, even if they were friends through their crush, the author should respect others' identities. Not supporting Momoe's coming out, especially in a group where others showed support, could be seen as lacking empathy. The author's silence and then the dismissive comment might have made Momoe feel isolated or judged, even if the author didn't mean to be.\n\nHowever, the author didn't actively mock or hurt Momoe. They just didn't engage. But in social situations, especially when someone is vulnerable sharing a part of themselves, silence can be interpreted as disapproval. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them is problematic because respecting someone's identity isn't about personal impact but about validating their experience.\n\nThe author's misunderstanding of asexuality is part of the issue. If they were unaware, maybe they should have asked questions instead of making assumptions. But since Momoe was open about it, the author's lack of support and their comment could be seen as hurtful.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if you don't fully understand or agree, showing respect is expected. The author's approach here may have been a lack of respect, leading to the friend feeling targeted. So, the author is likely in the wrong for not supporting Momoe's coming out and making a dismissive comment.\n"
