One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend named Momoe coming out as asexual. The author was sitting with a group of friends, trying to get closer to their crush, and then became friends with her friends. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the other friends immediately say they don't judge her. The author, however, is confused about what asexuality means and doesn't believe that someone can't have any sexual urges. They decide to stay quiet because they think it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. When Momoe asks their opinion, the author says they don't care unless it affects them, and Momoe gets angry, calling them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality is. Asexual people typically experience little or no sexual attraction. It's a valid sexual orientation, similar to being heterosexual, homosexual, etc. The author seems uncertain about whether asexuality means a choice or an inherent lack of sexual desire. That confusion might have led them to doubt Momoe's statement.\n\nThe author's response is to remain silent, thinking it's not their place to judge. However, when Momoe asks for their opinion, they state they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe takes this as judgment, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's lack of support or acknowledgment, their private doubts, and their dismissive response when confronted. In social dynamics, when someone shares a personal aspect of their identity, especially one that might be sensitive, the expected response is usually support or at least non-judgmental silence. The author's response of indifference could be seen as invalidating Momoe's experience. Even if the author had doubts, expressing them in a respectful way could have been better. Instead, the author chose to say they don't care unless it affects them, which might come off as dismissive or not taking the situation seriously. \n\nAdditionally, the author's initial reason for being in the group was to get closer to their crush, which might have led to a sense of not being fully part of the friend group, but that's not an excuse for how they responded. The fact that the other friends immediately supported Momoe while the author didn't might have made Momoe feel unsupported by the author, hence the anger. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. Asexuality is a valid orientation, and the author's response could be seen as lacking empathy or understanding. Even if the author didn't have strong opinions, the way they expressed their indifference might have been hurtful. In modern social contexts, being aware of and respecting others' identities is expected, even if one doesn't fully understand them. \n\nTherefore, the author's approach might be considered inconsiderate or bigoted, even if they didn't mean to be. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
