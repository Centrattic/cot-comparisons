One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend Momoe coming out as asexual. The author didn't show much reaction, stayed quiet, and when asked, said they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality actually means. From what I know, asexuality is a sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. It's a valid identity, just like others. The author seems confused about whether it's a choice or a lack of sexual desire. Their confusion might stem from not fully understanding the concept.\n\nThe author's response was to remain neutral and not engage, which Momoe took offense to. The key here is whether the author's lack of reaction constitutes being in the wrong. If the author's friend felt disrespected or judged because of the author's silence, then the author might have failed to support a friend's important personal statement. \n\nHowever, the author claims they didn't want to comment since they thought it wasn't their place. But in a situation like this, especially among friends, not responding when someone shares something personal can be seen as dismissive. The author's response of \"you can do what you want\" might come off as indifferent rather than supportive. \n\nAlso, the author's belief that if something doesn't affect them, they should stay out of it could be problematic. Even if the author isn't directly affected, respecting a friend's identity and offering support is part of being a good friend. The fact that the author didn't try to act like they cared might have hurt Momoe's feelings, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, while the author didn't explicitly make negative comments, their lack of positive support and the dismissive response could be seen as harmful. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't show the necessary support and respect for their friend's identity, even if they were confused about it.\n"
