One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation involves the author being friends with a group, mainly because they wanted to get closer to their crush. Then, one friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends support her, but the author doesn't really engage, thinking it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. When Momoe asks for their opinion, the author responds neutrally, and she gets angry, calling them a bigot.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't express support or empathy when Momoe came out, instead staying silent and later giving a dismissive response. The author's reasoning is that since it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. But the problem is that Momoe's coming out is a personal and significant moment. The author's reaction could be seen as insensitive, even if they're not directly attacking her. By not acknowledging her feelings and instead taking a detached stance, the author might have hurt her feelings. \n\nAsexuality is about not experiencing sexual attraction, but it's a valid sexual orientation. Dismissing someone's identity, even if you don't want to comment, can come across as judgmental. The author's response of \"you can do what you want as long as it doesn't affect me\" might imply a lack of understanding or acceptance, which can be hurtful. Even if the author isn't actively opposing Momoe's identity, their indifferent reaction can still be perceived as harmful. The friends who supported Momoe acted more appropriately by showing solidarity. The author's silence and subsequent neutral comment without empathy could be seen as wrong because it doesn't support their friend during a vulnerable moment. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
