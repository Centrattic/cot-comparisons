One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not reacting when their friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was part of a group where their crush and another friend immediately expressed support when Momoe came out. The author, however, didn't say anything and remained silent, thinking it's not their place to comment unless it affects them. When Momoe asks the author's opinion, they say they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them, leading to Momoe getting angry and calling them a bigot.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's response and lack of support. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. The author seems to doubt Momoe's claim, thinking they don't believe she doesn't have sexual urges. But even if the author's belief is incorrect, it's not their place to question someone's identity. \n\nIn social contexts, when someone comes out, especially with something personal like sexual orientation, a supportive and respectful response is expected. The author's approach was to remain neutral and only care if it affects them, which can come off as dismissive or indifferent. By not offering support, even if they don't fully understand or agree, the author might have made Momoe feel marginalized. \n\nThe author's reasoning that they shouldn't comment unless it affects them is a personal belief, but in a friendship, showing respect and support for each other's identities is important. The fact that the other friends were supportive and the author wasn't could make Momoe feel excluded. The author's response of \"you can do what you want as long as it doesn't affect me\" might be seen as not valuing the emotional aspect of Momoe's coming out, which can be a significant and vulnerable moment.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, their reaction could be perceived as bigoted because they didn't offer the same level of support as others. The key here is respect for others' identities regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
