One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author sat with a group of friends to get closer to their crush and became friends with them. Then, their friend Momoe comes out as asexual. The other friends are supportive. The author is confused about what asexuality means, thinks it might mean no sexual urges, and doesn't believe Momoe. They decide not to comment because they think it's not their place unless it affects them. When asked, they respond neutrally, which upsets Momoe, who calls them a bigot.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's lack of support and their dismissive attitude. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. The author's confusion and disbelief might stem from a lack of understanding. By not engaging and instead remaining indifferent, the author didn't show support. Even though they didn't actively criticize, their silence and the comment \"you can do what you want unless it affects me\" could be seen as not valuing Momoe's feelings or identity. \n\nAlso, the author didn't try to learn more about asexuality, which could have helped them respond appropriately. The fact that they didn't act like they care when they really don't is problematic. Even if it's not their place to judge, the way they handled it might have made Momoe feel invalidated. The other friends were supportive, so the author's reaction might have been unexpected and hurtful.\n\nSo, the author's actions (or inactions) led to Momoe feeling upset. Being a bigot isn't necessarily about hate, but about prejudice. The author's dismissive attitude and lack of empathy might be seen as prejudiced. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't support their friend and responded in a way that was hurtful.\n"
