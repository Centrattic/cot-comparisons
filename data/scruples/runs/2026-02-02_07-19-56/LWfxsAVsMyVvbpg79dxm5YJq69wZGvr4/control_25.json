One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not showing interest in their friend's asexuality.\n\nFirst, the author was part of a group where a friend, Momoe, came out as asexual. The crush and others were supportive. The author didn't know if asexuality meant no interest in sex or just not having urges. They stayed quiet, thinking it wasn't their place to comment unless it affected them. Momoe noticed and asked, so the author responded with a neutral stance. Momoe got angry, calling the author a bigot.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author didn't mock or criticize Momoe. They just didn't express support, maybe because they didn't understand it. But staying silent when someone shares such a personal thing can be hurtful. The author's response was to say they wouldn't care unless it affected them, which might come off as dismissive. However, the author wasn't actively opposing; they were just indifferent.\n\nAsexuality is a valid identity. The author's lack of reaction might not be malicious, but being a good friend usually involves showing respect and support, even if you don't fully understand. By not engaging, the author might have made Momoe feel unsupported. The key here is intent versus impact. The author didn't mean harm, but the impact was hurtful. So, whether the author is in the wrong depends on if their indifference counts as being in the wrong. Since the author wasn't hostile but failed to support, maybe they're not entirely at fault, but their approach was inconsiderate. The answer might be A (wrong) because being a good friend involves support, even if you don't understand. However, some might argue B (not wrong) since they didn't actively harm. But given the context of a friend coming out and expecting support, the author's silence and indifferent response could be seen as wrong. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
