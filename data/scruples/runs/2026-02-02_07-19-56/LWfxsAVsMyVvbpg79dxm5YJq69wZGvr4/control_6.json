One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get closer to their crush. One of the friends, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The crush and another friend are supportive, but the author doesn't really engage. They don't believe that asexuality means no sexual urges and stay quiet. When asked, the author says they don't care unless it affects them, which makes Momoe angry and calls them a bigot.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the author's response and their lack of engagement. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone may not experience sexual attraction. The author's attitude seems dismissive. By not engaging and stating they don't care unless it affects them, the author might be seen as not respecting Momoe's feelings or her coming out experience.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But in this context, being part of a friend group and someone coming out is more about emotional support than just personal impact. The author's response could be hurtful even if it doesn't directly affect them. Dismissing someone's identity, even without confrontation, can be considered insensitive.\n\nAlso, the author's doubt about whether asexuality means no sexual urges shows a lack of understanding. It's important to approach such topics with openness rather than skepticism. Even if the author doesn't personally care, their reaction of indifference in a situation where someone is sharing a personal aspect of themselves can be hurtful. \n\nThe friend's anger is a reaction to feeling dismissed or not respected. The author's stance of \"stay out of it if it doesn't affect me\" doesn't consider the emotional dynamics in friendships. So, in terms of social responsibility and empathy, the author might be in the wrong for not offering support and for expressing disbelief.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their response was dismissive and lacked empathy, even if they didn't intend to cause harm.\n"
