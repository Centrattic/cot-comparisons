One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation is that the friend, Momoe, came out as asexual, and the author didn't react much, just stayed quiet. When asked, the author said they don't care unless it affects them, which made Momoe angry and call them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what asexuality entails. Asexual people don't experience sexual attraction, or they might not have sexual desires. The author seems confused about the definitions, thinking it's about not having sex or not feeling urges. The key here is that the author didn't believe Momoe when she said she doesn't feel sexual urges. But that's not their place to judge. The author's stance was to stay out of it unless it affects them.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The author didn't express judgment, just remained neutral. However, the problem arises when the author's comment came off as dismissive or bigoted. Even if they didn't mean to, saying \"you can do what you want as long as it doesn't affect me\" might imply that the author isn't supportive or doesn't care about the friend's identity. Momoe might have felt invalidated because the author didn't acknowledge the significance of her coming out. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone comes out, especially about something personal like sexual orientation or asexuality, the expected response is support and empathy. The author's response was passive and didn't offer support, which could be seen as cold or indifferent. Even if the author didn't intend to be judgmental, not showing support can still hurt the friend. The author's confusion about asexuality might lead to misunderstandings, but that doesn't excuse a lack of support. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning was that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't intervene. But in friendships, being a good friend often involves being supportive even if the issue doesn't affect you personally. The author's response might have been perceived as not respecting Momoe's feelings or identity. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being supportive and for not taking the opportunity to educate themselves about asexuality instead of dismissing it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't make a derogatory comment, just stayed neutral. But neutrality in such contexts can sometimes be harmful if it's seen as indifference. The line between being neutral and being unsupportive can be thin here. The key point is that Momoe felt attacked, which suggests that the author's words were hurtful, even if unintended. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being supportive and for the dismissive comment.\n"
