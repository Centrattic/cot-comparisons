One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation is that the author was part of a friend group they joined to get closer to their crush. When the friend Momoe comes out as asexual, the author didn't react and just said they wouldn't care unless it affected them. Momoe then gets angry and calls them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand asexuality. Asexual people don't experience sexual attraction or have little to none. It's an orientation, similar to being gay or straight. The author's friend explained she doesn't have sexual urges, which the author found hard to believe. That skepticism might have contributed to the lack of reaction.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't interfere. They stayed quiet and didn't show concern. When Momoe asked for their opinion, they gave a neutral but dismissive response, saying they won't care unless it affects them. Momoe felt this was bigoted.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, not reacting to someone's personal identity could be seen as indifferent. However, the author didn't mock or attack Momoe; they just didn't engage. But in a friend group, showing support is important. Coming out as asexual is a personal moment, and a lack of response or perceived indifference can hurt. The author's response might be seen as not validating Momoe's feelings, which is important in maintaining trust and support in friendships.\n\nAlso, the author's belief that if something doesn't affect them, they should stay out of it. But in friendships, showing empathy and support is part of being a good friend, even if it doesn't directly affect you. The author's dismissiveness led Momoe to feel judged, which is a red flag. Bigotry isn't necessarily about opposing something but about being intolerant or judgmental. The author's response might not be malicious, but the effect was hurtful.\n\nSo the author's actions, while not overtly harmful, lacked the supportive and empathetic response a friend would expect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
