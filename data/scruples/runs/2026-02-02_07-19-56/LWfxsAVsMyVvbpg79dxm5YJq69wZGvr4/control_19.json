One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend coming out as asexual, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author was sitting with a group of girls, trying to get closer to their crush and ended up befriending them. When one friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual, the others support her. The author, however, doesn't really believe that asexuality means no sexual urges and stays quiet. When asked, the author says they don't care unless it affects them, leading Momoe to get angry and call them a bigot.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's understanding of asexuality might be incorrect, their lack of reaction, and their dismissive response. \n\nAsexuality is an orientation where someone may not experience sexual attraction. It's a valid identity, and it's important to respect people's self-identification. The author's disbelief about asexuality could stem from a lack of knowledge. However, even if their understanding was wrong, the main issue is how they reacted. \n\nBy staying silent and then giving a dismissive response that they don't care unless it affects them, the author might be seen as not respecting Momoe's identity. Even if they don't have strong feelings about it, not engaging in support and instead being indifferent can be hurtful. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. But in terms of friendship, being supportive and respectful is important regardless of personal impact. The fact that Momoe felt accused of being a bigot suggests that the author's response was perceived as disrespectful or dismissive.\n\nHowever, the author didn't outright deny asexuality or attack them. They just said they don't care unless it affects them. There's a line between respecting someone's identity and not being invested enough to care. But in a group where others are supportive, the author's indifference might be seen as lacking support, even if it's not malicious.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If Momoe felt disrespected or unsupported, then the author's response could be considered wrong. But if the author truly doesn't have an opinion and isn't trying to harm, maybe not. But generally, in relationships, being supportive and respectful is expected, even if you don't fully understand or believe in something. Dismissing someone's identity as not affecting you could be seen as not taking their feelings seriously. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (A for yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
