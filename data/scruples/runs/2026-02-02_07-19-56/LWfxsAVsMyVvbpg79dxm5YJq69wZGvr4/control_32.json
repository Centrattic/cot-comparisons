One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not caring that their friend is asexual. The situation involves the author being part of a group where a friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The author didn't engage in the conversation, stayed quiet, and when asked, gave a neutral response. Momoe got angry and called them a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author was trying to get closer to their crush and befriended her friends. When Momoe came out, the other friends were supportive. The author, however, didn't participate and remained quiet. When confronted, they said they wouldn't care unless it affected them, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, asexuality is an orientation where someone may not experience sexual attraction or have little interest in sex. It's important to note that this is a valid identity, and respecting someone's self-identification is crucial. The author's response of not caring unless it affects them might come off as dismissive or lacking empathy. Even if the author didn't have strong feelings about it, their reaction could be perceived as not supporting their friend, especially when others were being supportive.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment on it. However, this approach ignores the importance of emotional support and solidarity in friendships. When someone comes out, especially about a personal identity, expecting others to be silent or indifferent can be hurtful. The author's response might have made Momoe feel isolated or not accepted by the group.\n\nAlso, the author's doubt about Momoe's claims about not feeling sexual urges could indicate a lack of understanding or respect for her identity. Even if the author didn't believe her, it's not their place to question her experience. The key here is whether the author's actions were harmful. By staying silent and then giving a neutral, almost indifferent response, they might have contributed to Momoe feeling unsupported.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being respectful and showing support, even if one doesn't fully understand or care about the topic, is usually expected in friendships. The author's reaction, while perhaps not malicious, was likely hurtful. The fact that Momoe got angry and called them a bigot suggests that the author's response was seen as offensive or bigoted, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because their response was dismissive and could have made their friend feel unsupported. Respecting someone's identity and showing empathy, even if one doesn't personally care, is important in maintaining a supportive environment. The answer would lean towards AITA, meaning the author is at fault.\n"
