One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring when their friend came out as asexual. The situation involves the author sitting with a group of girls to get closer to their crush, becoming friends with them. When one friend, Momoe, comes out as asexual, the others are supportive, but the author remains quiet and doesn't express any opinion, even when asked. The author's reasoning is that they don't believe Momoe, think it's not their place to judge, and don't see it as affecting them. Momoe then gets angry, calling the author a bigot.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are wrong. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone experiences little or no sexual attraction. The author's friend Momoe expressed her identity, and the author didn't engage, then gave a neutral but dismissive response. The author claims they don't believe Momoe's asexuality, which is problematic because it's not up to the author to validate someone else's identity. \n\nThe key points here are respect for others' identities and the role of the author in the situation. Even if the author doesn't personally believe Momoe, it's important to respect her self-identification. The author's response of \"you can do what you want as long as it doesn't affect me\" could be seen as dismissive and not fully supportive. While the author isn't attacking or discriminating, their lack of support and the comment about not caring unless it affects them might come off as insensitive. Momoe might feel that the author is not acknowledging her identity or offering the same support the other friends showed. \n\nHowever, the author did not actively harm or mock Momoe, just remained neutral. But in cases of identity disclosure, especially in a group where others are supportive, the author's neutrality might still be perceived as indifference or lack of empathy. The question is whether the author's right to not care overrides the expectation of basic respect and support in a friendship. \n\nConsidering that the other friends were supportive, the author's response could be seen as less than respectful, even if they aren't outright wrong. The author's belief about asexuality might be based on a misunderstanding, and their lack of engagement in a supportive way might have hurt Momoe. So, while the author isn't necessarily a bad person, their actions might be considered inconsiderate, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
