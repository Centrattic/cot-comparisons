One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend coming out as asexual, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was sitting with a group of friends, mainly to get close to their crush. They became friends with the friends, including Momoe. When Momoe comes out as asexual, the others support her, but the author doesn't have a strong reaction. The author is confused about what asexuality means\u2014whether it's a choice or a lack of sexual desire. They don't engage in the conversation, stay quiet, and when asked, say they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry, calling the author a bigot. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants opinions. Let's break it down.\n\nAsexuality is an orientation where someone doesn't experience sexual attraction. It's not a choice, similar to other orientations. The author's doubt about whether it's a choice or not shows a lack of understanding. By not engaging and then dismissing the importance unless it affects them, the author might be seen as invalidating Momoe's identity. \n\nEven if the author wasn't interested in discussing it, the way they responded could come off as indifferent or dismissive. Telling someone that you don't care unless it affects you can be hurtful, especially when they're sharing something personal. The author's response doesn't acknowledge Momoe's feelings or the significance of her coming out. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that if it doesn't affect them, they shouldn't comment. However, being a good friend sometimes requires empathy and support, even if you don't fully understand or relate to the situation. The fact that the author stayed quiet but didn't offer support could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author's initial motivation for sitting with the group (to get closer to their crush) might have influenced their level of investment in the friendships, which could contribute to the lack of response. \n\nIn terms of being a bigot, the term is strong, but the author's actions might not be malicious. However, ignorance or lack of empathy can still hurt others. The key is whether the author's actions were harmful. By not supporting their friend during a vulnerable moment, the author likely hurt her feelings, even if they didn't intend to.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author is in the wrong because they failed to support their friend and responded in a way that invalidated her experience. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
