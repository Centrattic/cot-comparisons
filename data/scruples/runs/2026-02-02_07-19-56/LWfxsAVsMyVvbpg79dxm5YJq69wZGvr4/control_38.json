One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through their situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is sitting with a group of friends, mainly because they had a crush on one of them and ended up becoming friends with the others. Then, one of their friends, Momoe, comes out as asexual. The other friends, including the crush, immediately say they won't judge her. The author, however, is unsure about what being asexual really means. They thought it might be a choice to not have sex rather than a lack of sexual urges. The author doesn't believe that someone can completely lack sexual urges. They decide not to comment since they think it's not their place unless it affects them. When Momoe notices the silence and asks for their opinion, the author responds that they don't care unless it affects them. Momoe gets angry, calling the author a bigot. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the author's initial uncertainty and their reaction to Momoe's coming out. The author didn't express support, which might have made Momoe feel unsupported. But the author thought it wasn't their place to comment unless it affected them. However, in a situation where a friend is sharing personal information, especially about their identity, not responding positively or showing support can be hurtful. Even if the author is neutral, not engaging might be seen as dismissive. Also, the author's belief that asexuality is a choice (which isn't accurate) shows a misunderstanding. Asexuality is an inherent part of someone's identity, not a choice. The author's response that they don't care unless it affects them could be perceived as indifferent or uncaring, which is why Momoe was upset.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, their lack of support and the misunderstanding of asexuality might make them at fault. The fact that they didn't correct their own misconceptions and instead stayed silent, then gave a dismissive response, probably contributed to Momoe feeling hurt. In such situations, being supportive is important, even if you don't have a deep understanding. The author's approach was passive and possibly hurtful, so they might be in the wrong.\n"
