I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts and a disagreement over the amount spent. \n\nFirst, the guy spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner, etc. He thought that was sufficient, but his girlfriend was disappointed because he was traveling and she expected more, especially since he makes $85k a year. \n\nHe got upset because he felt he spent a lot, even though his income isn't that high. She called him manipulative for faking sadness. He left, and they're planning to talk later.\n\nHmm. The key points here are expectations and communication. He tried to make up for missing V Day with a big dinner and gifts. But she felt it wasn't enough, perhaps because he wasn't there on the actual day. However, his spending was significant relative to his income. \n\nIs he in the wrong? He spent a lot, maybe more than he should, but maybe she expected even more. However, he's not wrong to feel that $1,100 is a lot, especially if his income is $85k. But maybe he could have communicated better about his budget or expectations. On the other hand, she shouldn't have accused him of faking emotions. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't do anything wrong, then answer B. But if he should have known to do more despite his income, then A. But I think the issue is mutual misunderstanding. However, since he asked for advice, maybe the answer is B because he spent a lot and she's being unreasonable. Wait, but maybe he's wrong for not considering her expectations. But how could he know? They should have talked about expectations beforehand. Since they didn't, maybe both are at fault. But the question is about the author. So, maybe he's not in the wrong (B) because he tried his best given his resources and the situation. The GF's reaction might be excessive. But some might say he should have done more. But given his income, $1k is a significant chunk. So I think B is the answer.\n"
