I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts.\n\nSo, the author is a 22-year-old guy in a relationship with a 20-year-old girl for over a year. He's going on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day. They had a dinner the previous night to make up for it. He spent around $1,100 on gifts like a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, a card, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. However, his girlfriend was disappointed because he missed the actual Valentine's Day and thought he should have spent more, given his income. The author felt he did a lot, but she was upset, leading to an argument. He ended up being sad, and she accused him of manipulating by faking sadness. Now, he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author made an effort to compensate for missing V Day by spending a significant amount. The girlfriend's expectation was higher because of the missed date and his income. The author's defense is that the amount spent is already a lot, and he doesn't make that much. The girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Gift-giving can be a sensitive topic. Expectations vary between people. In a year-long relationship, maybe the girlfriend expected more, especially since he was making up for missing the actual V Day. However, the amount spent by the author is substantial. The problem might be that the girlfriend felt the gesture wasn't enough, not the amount itself. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author might not have discussed his plans with his girlfriend beforehand. Maybe she had different ideas of what would be appropriate. The author's defense is that he thought the gifts were good, but the girlfriend felt otherwise. It's possible that the author didn't consider her specific desires or that the gifts, while expensive, didn't meet her emotional needs. \n\nThe author responded by getting sad and saying he thought he did well, which the girlfriend saw as manipulative. This reaction could have made the situation worse. Instead of addressing her feelings, he became defensive. That's a red flag in communication. \n\nHowever, spending a large sum isn't inherently wrong. The issue might be about unmet expectations and how the conflict was handled. The author's actions (spending money) might not be wrong, but his response to her disappointment might have been. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he did put in effort and spent a lot, but the problem is the girlfriend's expectations and the communication breakdown. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be in the wrong if the girlfriend's feelings were invalid. But in relationships, both parties need to communicate and understand each other's expectations. The author might not have considered that even though he spent a lot, the girlfriend wanted something that would have been possible on V Day itself, which he missed. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person is considered at fault if their actions directly caused the issue. Here, the author tried to make up for missing V Day with gifts and a dinner. The girlfriend was disappointed, which might be her issue, but the author's response (getting sad, being defensive) might have exacerbated it. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not buying enough gifts. If the author did spend a lot, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's expectations were valid and the author didn't meet them despite having the means, maybe he is. \n\nThe key points are: 1) Did he do enough? 2) How he handled the conflict? \n\nThe first part is about expectations. The author might not be in the wrong for not meeting an expectation that's not clearly communicated. The second part is about his reaction. \n\nSince the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer could be B (No) because he made a significant effort. But some might say A (Yes) because he could have done more. \n\nHowever, in relationships, people have different needs. The girlfriend might need gestures on specific days, and the author might value compensation through gifts. It's a subjective matter. But since the author tried to compensate with a big dinner and gifts, and the girlfriend still felt it wasn't enough, the author might not be in the wrong. Unless there was prior discussion about what would make up for missing V Day, but there's no mention of that in the question. \n\nSo, based on the information, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He spent a lot and tried to compensate. The girlfriend's reaction is her own, and the author's response was perhaps immature, but he isn't at fault for the spending amount.\n"
