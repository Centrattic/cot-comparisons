I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend more gifts on Valentine's Day. The author spent around $1,100, which seems like a lot, but the girlfriend was disappointed because he missed the actual day and he makes money. The girlfriend expects more since he's away and his income is $85k. The author got gifts, dinner, etc., but she thought it wasn't enough. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was on a business trip, so missing V-Day in person might be a factor. They had a dinner to compensate. The girlfriend likes gifts, so the author tried to make up for it. However, she felt it was insufficient. \n\nThe author's spending is significant, but maybe the girlfriend expected more because he was absent. Some people might value presence over gifts, so missing the day could make her feel he's not prioritizing her. But the author did spend a lot, which shows effort. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. The author got emotional and felt hurt, which is a normal reaction. She accused him of manipulating by faking sadness, which could be a conflict in communication styles. \n\nIn relationships, expectations can vary. If the author thought $1k was enough, but the girlfriend expected more, maybe there was a miscommunication. However, the author isn't wrong for not spending more if he felt his gifts were sufficient. The girlfriend's disappointment is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author is paying for dinner and the trip himself, which is generous. The key point is whether the amount spent is reasonable. $1k is a lot, but maybe the girlfriend expected more extravagant gifts or multiple high-end items beyond a bracelet, bear, chocolates, and roses. \n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't make as much as the girlfriend thought. His income is $85k, but the argument is about how much he should spend. There's no set rule on how much to spend. \n\nSo, the author's actions might not be wrong. The problem could be differing expectations. The author tried to show appreciation, but the girlfriend wanted more. Since both have their perspectives, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
