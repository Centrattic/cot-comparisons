I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts on Valentine's Day. The situation is that the author is missing Valentine's Day because of a business trip and had a dinner the night before. They spent $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, a card, and an expensive dinner. However, the girlfriend was disappointed because she expected more, given that he earns $85k a year. The author got sad, which the girlfriend took as manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points here. The author is a 22-year-old making $85k a year, which is a decent salary, but not everyone in that age group makes that much. The girlfriend is 20 and has been with him for over a year. The total spending is around $1,100, which the author considers a lot, especially since they had an expensive dinner. The girlfriend, though, felt it wasn't enough, maybe because he was away and she thought his income should allow for more.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The main factors here are communication, expectations, and the actual value of the gifts relative to their relationship. The author might have thought their gestures were sufficient, but the girlfriend had higher expectations, possibly due to the missed V Day and his salary. But the author's response to feeling sad when confronted might have been misinterpreted as insincerity or manipulation, which is a problem. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She took an Uber home and the author ignored her, which could be seen as dismissive. However, the author might have been stressed about the trip. The key issue is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. Spending $1,100 is a lot, but maybe in the context of the girlfriend expecting more because he was away. However, the argument about income is a bit tricky. $85k is a good salary, but in some areas, that might not be enough to afford extravagant gifts regularly. \n\nAlso, the author's emotional response and the girlfriend perceiving it as a manipulation tactic could indicate a communication breakdown. The author might not have realized that the girlfriend felt the gifts weren't enough, and the way they expressed disappointment led to conflict. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, Valentine's Day is a gift-giving holiday, and missing it might lead to higher expectations for a substitute. But the author did plan a dinner and gifts in advance, which is thoughtful. The girlfriend's annoyance over the reaction might be about how the author handled the situation rather than the gifts themselves. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were truly insufficient or if the conflict stems from unmet expectations and communication issues. The author isn't in the wrong because $1,100 is a significant amount, and the girlfriend's expectations might not be realistic. Also, the author attempted to make up for missing V Day. However, the way the author responded emotionally could have been better handled. But the main question is if the author is in the wrong for not buying more, which depends on the girlfriend's perspective. Since the author did spend a considerable sum, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is unreasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
