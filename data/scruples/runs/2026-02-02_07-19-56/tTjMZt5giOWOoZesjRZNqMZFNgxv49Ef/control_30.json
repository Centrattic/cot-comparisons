I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy is going on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day, so they had a dinner instead. He spent over $1,100 on various gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner. But his girlfriend was disappointed and thought he should have spent more because he was missing the actual day and he makes a decent income (85k). The guy feels hurt that she's not appreciative, and she gets angry and says he's manipulating her by faking sadness.\n\nHmm, first, did he do enough? Well, $1k is a lot, especially for someone earning 85k a year. But maybe the girlfriend had higher expectations because they were celebrating a year together and the trip was a big deal. But then again, the guy missed the actual day, so maybe she wanted something else besides the gifts. Or perhaps she was upset that he was gone, and the gifts didn't compensate enough.\n\nHe tried to explain he spent a lot, but she dismissed it. She accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. That's a serious accusation. Maybe she felt like he was trying to guilt-trip her by acting hurt. The guy then ignored her and left, which might have been hurtful.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he did spend a lot, but maybe he didn't consider her emotional needs beyond gifts. Relationships require communication. He assumed gifts would be enough, but maybe she wanted more effort in making up for missing the day. Also, his reaction of getting sad and ignoring her could be seen as passive-aggressive or dismissive. She might feel unheard. On the other hand, she could be being unreasonable to expect more after such a big spend. But the fact that she's disappointed and he's reacting with sadness and withdrawal might not be the healthiest approach. So maybe both have some fault, but the question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points: Did he fail to meet her expectations? Maybe he should have communicated better about what she wanted. He spent money, but maybe she wanted different gestures. Also, his reaction of getting sad and ignoring her might be the wrong approach. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but perhaps he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong\" for not buying enough. If the problem is that he didn't buy enough, then maybe the answer is A. But if it's about how he handled the situation, maybe not. But the girlfriend's disappointment is valid if that's her expectation. But the guy did spend a lot. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he tried to make it up and spent a lot, but there's room for improvement in communication. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be excessive. Alternatively, if she felt he didn't put enough effort regardless of the money, then the answer could be A. But given the details, the author's actions might not be wrong. So probably B.\n"
