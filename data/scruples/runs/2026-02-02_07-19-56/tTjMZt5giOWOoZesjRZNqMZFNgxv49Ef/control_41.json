I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is at fault for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy, 22, is about to go on a business trip for a week and misses Valentine's Day. He and his girlfriend, who is 20 and they've been together over a year, had dinner to make up for it. He spent around $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, a dozen roses, a card, and an expensive dinner. She was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and mentions his income (he's making $85k this year), expecting more. He felt it was a lot, got sad, and she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. They had a fight, and they're not talking much before he leaves.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and the value of gifts. The guy tried to make up for missing the day by spending a significant amount. However, the girlfriend felt that he didn't meet her expectations because he wasn't present on the actual day and thought his income allowed for more spending. \n\nI think the issue is about communication. The guy might have assumed that the gifts were sufficient, but the girlfriend might have wanted more, possibly expecting something different or more personalized. He didn't consider her feelings about missing the day entirely, even though they had plans. Also, the way he reacted\u2014getting sad and implying he's being unfair\u2014might have hurt her feelings. However, his spending was substantial, and $1,100 is a lot, especially for someone making $85k. But maybe she had different expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, he tried to compensate with the dinner and gifts. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for expecting more despite the trip being a business necessity. But maybe he could have communicated better about his intentions and checked in if she felt it was enough. However, the conflict here is mutual. He might not be in the wrong because he made efforts, even if they fell short of her expectations. But maybe he's in the wrong if he didn't consider that missing the actual day required more effort. \n\nAlternatively, it's possible that both have valid points. However, in AITA scenarios, the answer is usually one person being the asshole. Since he tried to make up for it, but she still felt disappointed, maybe he's not in the wrong. But he could have been more proactive in understanding her needs. But since the question is if HE is in the wrong, and he did spend a lot, maybe the answer is B (No). However, the fact that she felt he could buy more because of his income might indicate that he's not in the wrong. The argument is that he spent a lot, but maybe the girlfriend is unreasonable. So the answer would be B.\n"
