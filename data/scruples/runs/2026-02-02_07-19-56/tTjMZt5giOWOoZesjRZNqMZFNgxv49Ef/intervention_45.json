I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation involves a guy who spent around $1,100 on various gifts, including a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and a dinner at an expensive restaurant. However, his girlfriend was disappointed because he was going to miss the actual Valentine's Day and felt that since he makes $85k a year, he should have spent more. The author got upset and accused her of manipulating him by faking sadness, then ignored her to leave for a trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author spent a significant amount, which is a considerable portion of his income. From his viewpoint, he might feel he did enough, especially since he made up for missing the day with a nice dinner. On the other hand, the girlfriend expected more because he was absent and his income level, which she might see as a reason to spend more.\n\nGift-giving can be subjective. What one person considers generous, another might see as insufficient. The girlfriend's reaction of being annoyed and the argument that followed could indicate a mismatch in expectations. The author's response\u2014getting sad, saying he thought he did well, and then ignoring her\u2014might come off as dismissive or not empathetic. The accusation of her manipulating by \"faking\" sadness is also problematic because it could be seen as invalidating her feelings.\n\nFinancial expectations in relationships often depend on mutual understanding. If the couple had discussed gift-giving norms beforehand, this situation might have been avoided. The author might have assumed his spending was adequate, but the girlfriend's reaction suggests that her expectations were higher. Since the author is the one who didn't meet her expectations and reacted defensively, he might be in the wrong here. However, it's also possible that the girlfriend's expectations were unreasonable given the author's income and the fact that they were already spending a lot. But given the way the argument went, with the author not acknowledging her feelings and the girlfriend feeling unappreciated, it's more likely the author is at fault for not meeting her emotional needs, even if the financial aspect is complex.\n"
