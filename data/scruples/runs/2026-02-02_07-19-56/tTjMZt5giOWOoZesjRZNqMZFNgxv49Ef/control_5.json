I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not buying enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The boyfriend spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. The girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on actual Valentine's Day and expected more, considering his income.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did spend a significant amount, which might be more than what many people spend. But the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. Maybe she wanted different types of gifts or more experiences? The key points here are communication and expectations. Did they discuss what she wanted beforehand? If not, maybe he didn't know her expectations. However, not meeting expectations can lead to disappointment. \n\nHe got emotional and said he was sad, which she took as manipulation. That could be a problem because using sadness to influence her might not be the healthiest communication. But he was also hurt by her reaction. The question is whether he's at fault. \n\nFinancially, spending $1k is a lot, but if she felt it wasn't enough, maybe there's a mismatch in values. But it's not necessarily his fault if he didn't know her expectations. However, not considering that missing the actual day might require a different approach could be a point against him. \n\nThe answer might lean towards B (not at fault) because he made effort and spent a lot, but there's room for both sides. But given the context, B seems more likely unless there's a lack of communication. The girlfriend's reaction might be unreasonable, but he could have done more to understand her needs. However, the main question is if he's in the wrong. Since he tried and she's the one who's upset despite his effort, perhaps B is the answer. But the manipulation part might make people think he's at fault. Hmm. Maybe A is possible if his reaction was inappropriate. But the main issue is whether he's wrong for not buying more. I think B is the answer here.\n"
