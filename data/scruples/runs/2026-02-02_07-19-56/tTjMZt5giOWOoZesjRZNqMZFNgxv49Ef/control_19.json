I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts on Valentine's Day. \n\nFirst, the situation: the guy, who's 22 and makes $85k a year, is going on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day. They had a dinner to make up for it. He spent about $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, a card, and an expensive dinner. The girlfriend seemed disappointed and expected more because he's making a lot of money. The guy felt it was a lot, but she was upset, leading to an argument where she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. Now, he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the expectations around gift-giving, communication, and whether the amount spent was appropriate. \n\nValentine's Day is a cultural event where gift-giving is traditional, but what's considered \"enough\" can vary. The guy spent over $1,000, which is significant, especially for someone making $85k a year. However, the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough because he was missing the actual day. The question is whether his actions were reasonable given their relationship dynamics and her expectations.\n\nI need to consider if the amount he spent was appropriate. $1,100 is a lot, but maybe she expected something more extravagant or personal. The fact that she felt he could do more because of his income suggests that there might be a mismatch in expectations. Perhaps he didn't communicate his reasons for how much he spent, or maybe she felt that missing the actual day required more significant gestures. \n\nAlso, his reaction when she expressed disappointment\u2014getting sad and then ignoring her\u2014might have been hurtful. She felt he was faking sadness to manipulate her, which points to a lack of empathy or understanding from his side. That's a red flag. Even if he thought he did the right thing, how he handled the situation when she was upset could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, spending over a thousand dollars is a lot, and maybe she's being unreasonable. But the issue is not just the amount; it's about the emotional response and communication. The guy might not be in the wrong for the spending amount, but in how he handled the conflict. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not buying enough gifts. If the problem is the quantity/quality of gifts, then it's about expectations. If the girlfriend felt it was insufficient despite the cost, maybe the guy didn't consider her preferences. \n\nAlternatively, if he spent a lot but she wanted something more meaningful or specific, then maybe he didn't meet her emotional needs. So, the core issue is whether his actions were considerate of her feelings and expectations. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and communication. The guy's intention was to make up for missing V Day with a nice dinner and gifts. But if she felt it wasn't enough, maybe he didn't ask her what she wanted or consider her perspective. His reaction to her disappointment (getting sad and then ignoring her) might have been dismissive. \n\nSo, considering all this, the guy might be partially in the wrong for not fully understanding her expectations and for how he handled the conflict, even if the amount spent was high. The answer could be A (he is in the wrong), because it's about not considering her feelings and the way he responded, even if the spending was substantial.\n"
