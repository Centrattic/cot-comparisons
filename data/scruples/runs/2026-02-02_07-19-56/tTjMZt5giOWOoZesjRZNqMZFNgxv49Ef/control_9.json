I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. They spent around $1,100 on a bracelet, a big bear, chocolates, roses, dinner, and a card. But the girlfriend was disappointed because he was away on a business trip and she expected more given his income.\n\nHmm, first, the user is in a 12-month relationship. He tried to make up for missing V-Day with a dinner and gifts. The girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nWell, he spent a significant amount, which is over his annual income. So financially, he might not have a lot to spare. But the girlfriend expected more. However, expectations can vary. Some people place a high value on gift-giving for Valentine's, others not so much. \n\nThe user's reaction when she expressed disappointment was to get sad and then ignore her. That might have come off as dismissive. She felt annoyed and accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. That's a serious accusation, which could hurt the relationship. His response of ignoring her and leaving might have been a way to avoid conflict, but it could also be seen as not addressing her feelings properly.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If they had prior expectations about gift-giving for V-Day, and he wasn't meeting them, maybe he's at fault. But if there were no prior discussions, and he made an effort, perhaps she's overstepping. The key points are communication and mutual expectations. Since the user didn't mention prior talks about gift expectations, maybe both sides have some responsibility. However, his reaction to her disappointment might have been inappropriate. He could have tried to understand her perspective better instead of getting defensive and ignoring her. So, maybe he's partially at fault for not communicating and for his reaction, but the girlfriend's expectations might be unreasonable given his spending. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the user not being entirely wrong. So answer B.\n"
