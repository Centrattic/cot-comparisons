I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a guy who's been in a relationship for over a year. He's going on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day, so he and his girlfriend have dinner instead. He spent around $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, a dozen roses, a card, and paid for an expensive dinner. But his girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on Valentine's Day and thought he should have spent more since he makes $85k a year. The author feels it's a lot, especially considering his salary, and got hurt when she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. They ended up ignoring each other, and he's now asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider expectations. Valentine's Day is a big deal for some people, and missing it could be seen as missing out on a key moment. The girlfriend might feel that the effort to be there is part of what makes the day special. Even though he tried to compensate with a dinner and gifts, absence can still be a dealbreaker for some. But he did spend a significant amount, which is more than many people spend. However, his salary is $85k, so $1k is a meaningful portion of his income. Maybe she expected more because he's earning a lot, but he feels that's stretching it.\n\nThe conflict here is about differing expectations. He thought his gestures were sufficient, especially considering he's missing the day. She felt he should have gone above and beyond because he's making good money. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not meeting her expectations. \n\nHe also reacted by getting sad and feeling like she was accusing him of manipulation, which might have been an emotional response. His reaction to ignore her and go to the airport could be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, he was going on a trip and might have been stressed. \n\nCommunication seems like a big issue here. They might not have discussed expectations beforehand. He might not have realized how important her presence on Valentine's was to her, and she might not have understood his financial perspective. \n\nIn relationships, gift-giving is about thoughtfulness and effort, not just money. But in this case, the girlfriend valued the physical presence. The author tried to compensate with gifts but didn't address the absence. However, missing the actual day might be a dealbreaker for her. \n\nIs the author wrong? If he didn't communicate his side and she felt unappreciated, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if he could have done more to make up for missing the day, even with the gifts, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit subjective. The key is whether he failed to understand her needs. Since they've been together a year, he should know her preferences. If she's someone who values presence over gifts, then he's in the wrong. But if their communication was off, maybe it's a mutual issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not necessarily if the girlfriend is right. \n\nThe answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because he did spend a lot and tried to make up for it. But maybe A because he didn't consider that presence was more important. Hmm. I need to decide based on the information given. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B.\n"
