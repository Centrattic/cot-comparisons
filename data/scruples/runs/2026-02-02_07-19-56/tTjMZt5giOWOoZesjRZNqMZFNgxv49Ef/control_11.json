I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent around $1,100 on various gifts, including a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. He missed actual Valentine's Day because of a business trip and had dinner that night. His girlfriend was disappointed, expecting more since he makes $85k and he wasn't there on V-Day. The guy feels he did enough, but she's upset. He got sad, she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The key points here are expectations vs. actions. The guy spent a lot, but his GF expected more. However, $1,100 is a significant amount, especially for someone earning $85k. The fact that they were together for over a year and he made an effort with a dinner and gifts when he couldn't be there on V-Day might show he tried. But the girlfriend might have different expectations. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not understanding his partner's needs. Maybe she values presence more than material gifts. By missing V-Day entirely, even if he compensated with a dinner that night, she might feel unappreciated. The argument over expectations is common. The guy might not be in the wrong if he genuinely tried, but maybe he should have communicated better. However, the way he reacted (getting sad, implying she was unreasonable) could have been hurtful. Also, the girlfriend's reaction of being annoyed and taking an Uber home might indicate deeper issues. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether missing V-Day and not meeting her expectations, despite the spending, is a fault. The author might not be in the wrong if he made a good faith effort, but maybe he is if he didn't consider her emotional needs. However, since he spent a lot and tried to make up for it, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid because expectations vary. The key is that both parties have different expectations, but the author's actions were substantial. So, the answer is B.\n"
