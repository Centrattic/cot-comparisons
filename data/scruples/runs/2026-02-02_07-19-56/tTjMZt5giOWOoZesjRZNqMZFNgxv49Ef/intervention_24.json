I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong in the situation described. The person, a 22-year-old male, spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend for Valentine's Day, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner, and a card. He was going on a business trip and missed Valentine's Day, so they had dinner the night before. His girlfriend was disappointed, expecting more because he's making $85k a year. He got upset, she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her, and they ended up separating for the night.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, consider the arguments. The author spent a significant amount of money, which is a lot for someone making $85k. However, the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. He thought he did well, but she expected more. The key points here are communication, expectations, and emotional responses. \n\nDid he fail to communicate his intentions? He tried to make up for missing the day with a dinner and gifts. However, she felt he should have done more. Maybe he didn't consider her expectations properly. On the other hand, spending over $1,000 is substantial, especially for someone with a lower income. Was his reaction appropriate? He got sad and defensive, which might have been hurtful. His girlfriend felt he was manipulating her by faking sadness, which could indicate a lack of emotional intelligence. \n\nIs the problem on the author's side? If he didn't discuss his plans beforehand, maybe he should have. But given that he was going away, perhaps he tried to compensate. However, when she expressed disappointment, his response was to become sad and defensive instead of listening, leading to conflict. The girlfriend might have valid feelings, but the author's reaction could have been worse. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's possible that he didn't consider her feelings enough and reacted poorly. But spending so much money might not be the issue. The conflict arises from how they handled the situation. Since he was trying to make it up to her and she felt it wasn't enough, but his reaction was to become defensive and leave, which might not be the best approach. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were unreasonable. Here, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing her expectations and reacting defensively. So I think the answer is A.\n"
