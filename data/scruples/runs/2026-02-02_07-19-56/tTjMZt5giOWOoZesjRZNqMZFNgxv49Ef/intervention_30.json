I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (M22) is in the wrong for not buying his girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The girlfriend (F20) was disappointed because he was on a business trip and missed the actual day, even though he spent $1,100 on various gifts and dinner. The author is upset because he thought his spending was sufficient, but she expected more given his income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author spent a significant amount, which might be a lot for someone earning $85k. However, the girlfriend might feel that since he's missing the actual Valentine's Day, he should have compensated more. The key points here are expectations versus actions. Did the author meet the girlfriend's expectations?\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was disappointment and annoyance, which the author found unfair. The author's response included getting sad and then ignoring her, which might have been seen as dismissive. The girlfriend accused him of trying to manipulate by faking sadness. That's a serious accusation and could indicate a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's defense is that he spent a lot, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. The girlfriend's perspective is that given the circumstances (missing the actual day and his income), more was expected. The author might be in the wrong if he didn't communicate his intentions clearly or if he assumed his spending was sufficient without considering her feelings. However, the girlfriend's accusation of manipulation is harsh and might be unwarranted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that $1,100 is a significant amount, especially if that's a large portion of his monthly income. The problem might be mismatched expectations. The author didn't realize that the girlfriend valued the actual day more than the alternative plans. In relationships, expectations can vary, and communication is key. If the author didn't check in with her about what she wanted, that's a flaw. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be disproportionate if the spending was indeed substantial for him.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating her expectations about the importance of the actual Valentine's Day and not addressing her disappointment constructively. Instead of defending his actions, he got defensive and ignored her, which could worsen the situation. The girlfriend's feelings are valid if she felt unappreciated, but her accusation of manipulation is a strong move. The answer might hinge on whether the spending was reasonable given their relationship and financial situations. However, the author's response (getting sad and ignoring her) is not ideal. So, leaning towards the author being at least partially in the wrong, but the girlfriend's harsh reaction also isn't justified. The main issue is communication breakdown.\n"
