I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend more gifts for Valentine's Day. The scenario is that the author, a 22-year-old guy, missed Valentine's Day because he was on a business trip. They had dinner the night before, and he spent around $1,100 on gifts, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and the dinner. The girlfriend was disappointed, thinking he should have spent more since he's making $85k and missed the actual day. The author felt it was enough and got upset when she said he was manipulating her by faking sadness.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is wrong here. The key points are the amount spent, the girlfriend's expectations, and how they handled the situation. The author did spend a significant amount, which is a large portion of his annual income (since he's making $85k). Spending $1.1k is considerable, especially for someone in their early 20s. The girlfriend expected more, but her reasoning is that he's earning a decent salary and missed the actual day. However, the author's perspective is that he made an effort with the gifts and dinner as a substitute for being there. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems a bit harsh. The author's spending was generous, but maybe she wanted different gestures rather than more money. The argument about \"faking\" sadness might be a communication issue. The author's response to ignore her and leave could be seen as dismissive. However, he had a flight to catch, so maybe he was trying to de-escalate the conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author isn't in the wrong if he made a genuine effort. The girlfriend's expectations might be unreasonable given the circumstances. The fact that he spent a lot but still faced disappointment could be due to differing views on gift-giving. The author's reaction of getting upset and leaving might not be the best approach, but that's more about how the conflict was handled rather than being inherently wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No). The key factors are the amount spent relative to his income, the effort made, and the girlfriend's expectations not aligning with his. While communication issues exist, the author isn't wrong for not spending more if he felt it was sufficient.\n"
