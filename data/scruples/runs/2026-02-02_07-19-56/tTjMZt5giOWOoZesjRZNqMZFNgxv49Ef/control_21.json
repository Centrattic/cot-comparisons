I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not meeting their girlfriend's expectations regarding Valentine's Day gifts. The author spent $1,100 on various gifts, including a Tiffany bracelet, a large stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant, and a card. The girlfriend was disappointed because he was missing V-Day on a business trip and expected more, considering his income. The author spends 85k a year. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were inappropriate. He did spend a significant amount, which is a substantial portion of his annual income. The girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, but the author felt he had done well. The argument here is about expectations and communication.\n\nThe key points are: \n- The author made an effort to compensate by planning a dinner the day before his trip, spending a lot.\n- The girlfriend expressed disappointment, possibly because she had different expectations given the absence on V-Day.\n- The author's response was to feel sad and not meet her demands, leading to a conflict.\n\nIs it the author's fault? It depends on whether he should have anticipated her higher expectations. Maybe the problem is that their expectations weren't aligned. The author might not be wrong for spending what he did, but perhaps he didn't communicate his reasons or listen to her feelings properly. However, the girlfriend's reaction that he was manipulating by faking sadness is harsh. \n\nThe author's actions in terms of spending were generous. The issue seems to be about differing opinions on what is appropriate. Since the author tried to make up for missing V-Day with a dinner and gifts, maybe he isn't entirely at fault. But perhaps the girlfriend felt that not being present was a bigger issue, and the author didn't address that. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's expectations were unreasonable given his financial situation and the effort made, then the author isn't wrong. The answer might be B (No). However, if the author should have understood her need for more gestures despite the money spent, then he might have some responsibility. But given the information, the author did what he thought was appropriate, so likely the answer is B.\n"
