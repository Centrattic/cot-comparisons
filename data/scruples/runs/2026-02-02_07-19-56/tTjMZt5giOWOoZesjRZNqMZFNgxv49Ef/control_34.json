I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about Valentine's Day gifts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a guy who spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant, and a card. He missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip and had dinner the night before. However, his girlfriend was disappointed and thought he should have spent more because he makes $85k a year. The guy felt he did well, but she was upset, leading to some arguments.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are the expectations and communication between both parties. He spent a significant amount, which is more than some people might do. However, the girlfriend had higher expectations because he was absent and his income. \n\nBut wait, he's making $85k, which is a decent salary, but spending over $1k in one go is a big chunk. Maybe she felt that since he's making more, he should spend more. However, he might not have thought that way. The problem here seems to be a mismatch in expectations. Did he know she wanted more? Did they communicate their expectations beforehand?\n\nHe mentioned that he thought the gifts were nice and made up for missing the actual day. She was disappointed and accused him of manipulating by faking sadness. That part is tricky. Did he really fake being sad, or was he genuinely hurt? Also, ignoring her and leaving might come off as dismissive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend didn't express her expectations clearly, maybe she's at fault for not being upfront. But if the guy assumed spending $1k was enough without checking in, then maybe he had a responsibility to ensure she felt valued. \n\nAnother angle: Val's Day is a special day, and missing it could require more effort. But he did the dinner the night before. Maybe she wanted something on the actual day? However, he was traveling for work, so that's out of his control. \n\nThe argument about faking sadness is a red flag. Accusing someone of manipulating by being emotional isn't healthy. That might have escalated things. But the guy's reaction of feeling hurt and ignoring her could be seen as not taking her feelings seriously. \n\nSo, who's right? It's a bit of a two-way street. The guy did spend a lot, but maybe he didn't consider that absence might require more than just a big gift. The girlfriend might have unrealistic expectations given the circumstances. However, the way she reacted (calling him an asshole) and the lack of communication from both sides might place some blame on both. \n\nIn AITA posts, the answer isn't always black and white, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking if he's the asshole, but the girlfriend's response was also harsh and possibly uncalled for. He might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong for not meeting her needs despite the circumstances. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he made an effort, but there's room for both to improve communication. However, if the standard is meeting expectations regardless of the circumstances, then maybe he is in the wrong for not considering her feelings more. It's a tough call.\n"
