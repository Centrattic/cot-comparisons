I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (M22) is in the wrong for not buying enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation is that he missed V Day due to a business trip and spent around $1,100 on a bracelet, a big bear, chocolates, roses, a card, and dinner. His girlfriend was disappointed because she expected more since he was missing the actual day and he makes \"a lot of money\" (though he's on track for $85k, which isn't exactly high in some contexts). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author spent a significant amount, but maybe the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough because he missed the actual day and had the means. The key points here are expectations vs. reality. The author might have thought $1k was sufficient, but the girlfriend might see missing the day as a bigger deal, thus expecting more or different gestures.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The author might not have realized that the girlfriend wanted more thoughtful or personalized gifts instead of just expensive ones. Also, the girlfriend's reaction of being annoyed and accusing him of faking sadness could indicate a deeper issue in their communication or expectations around gift-giving.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author earns $85k, but $1,100 is a significant portion of that. Maybe the girlfriend felt he could do more, but the author might feel it's excessive. However, the problem isn't just about money; it's about the thought and effort. The author might have misjudged what she values.\n\nThe author's response to the disappointment was to get sad and then withdraw, which might have made her feel unacknowledged. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling undervalued or that her feelings weren't taken seriously. The author's choice to ignore her and leave might have been hurtful.\n\nIn terms of AITA standards, it's often about whether someone acted unreasonably. The author tried to make up for missing V Day with gifts, but maybe didn't consider her preferences. However, the girlfriend's response was also harsh, possibly overreacting. But since the question is about the author, if he failed to meet her expectations despite the effort, he might be at fault for not understanding her needs better. On the other hand, if the girlfriend had unrealistic expectations given their financial situation, the author might not be entirely wrong. But given that the author's approach led to conflict and he didn't adequately address her feelings, he might be in the wrong for not being more attuned to her emotional needs.\n"
