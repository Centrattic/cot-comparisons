I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy missed the actual day because of a business trip, but he spent a lot on her\u2014like $1,100. He got her a Tiffany bracelet, a huge bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. The girl was disappointed because he wasn't there on V Day and thought he should have spent more since he makes $85k a year.\n\nHmm, the guy thinks he did a lot, but the girl expected more. The question is whether he was wrong. Well, he did spend a significant amount, but maybe the problem is that the girl wanted more than just the stuff. Maybe she wanted his presence, which he couldn't provide. He tried to make up for it with the dinner and gifts, but she still felt it wasn't enough. \n\nBut wait, when he said he was sad, she accused him of faking it to manipulate her. That seems harsh. Maybe she's reacting emotionally because she was disappointed. The guy felt hurt that she was annoyed and ignored her, which isn't great communication. But was he wrong in not buying more? He already spent over a thousand, which is a lot, especially for someone making 85k\u2014though maybe she expects more based on his income? \n\nI think the key points are: he missed the actual day, she wanted more presence, and maybe the gifts weren't enough for her. But he did spend a lot. However, the way he responded when she expressed disappointment\u2014getting sad and then ignoring her\u2014might not be the best approach. But in terms of the gifts, was he wrong? Maybe not. He tried to compensate, but maybe she wanted different gestures. The answer might be that he's not entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement. But the question is specifically about not buying enough gifts. Since he spent a lot, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe the fact that he didn't consider her feeling about missing the day entirely makes him wrong. Hmm. I'm leaning towards not in the wrong because he made an effort, but the communication was bad. So answer B.\n"
