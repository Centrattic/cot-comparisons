I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about whether the guy is in the wrong for not buying his girlfriend more gifts for Valentine's Day. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big bear, chocolates, roses, a card, and dinner, but she was disappointed because he missed the actual day and thought he should have spent more, especially considering his income. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if his spending was inadequate. He's making $85k a year, which is considered a good income in many places. The total spent is about $1,100, which is a significant amount. For a one-day holiday, that's a lot. But maybe she expected more because he's missing the actual day. However, he did plan a dinner to make up for it. \n\nThe girl's reaction seems harsh. Arguing that he's \"trying to manipulate her by faking being sad\" is a strong accusation. The guy was genuinely trying to make it up to her, and she's upset that he didn't spend more. But is there a standard amount that's expected? It's subjective. Some people value experiences over gifts, but she said she likes receiving gifts. So he tried to meet her preferences.\n\nHe was hurt and felt defensive when she criticized his spending. His response was to isolate himself by going to the airport, which might not be the best approach for conflict resolution, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong for the spending. \n\nThe key points are: he spent a lot, she felt it wasn't enough, and there's a conflict in expectations. The guy isn't at fault for not meeting her expectations if they weren't communicated. The girl's reaction might be unreasonable, especially since he's trying to compensate for missing the day. The amount he spent is substantial, so he's not in the wrong for not buying more. The answer should be B.\n"
