I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying more gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation is that the author (M22) spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, dinner, and a card. But his girlfriend (F20) was disappointed because he was traveling for a week and missed actual Valentine's Day, plus she thought he should have spent more given his income of $85k.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author spent a significant amount, but the girlfriend was still disappointed. The main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. \n\nThe girlfriend's main points are that he missed the actual day and should have spent more. The author argues that he already spent over $1k, which is a substantial amount, especially since his annual income is $85k (so $1k is about 1.1% of his income, which isn't trivial but maybe not excessive). He also tried to make up for it with a dinner. \n\nThe author's defense is that he thought the gifts were sufficient and that he didn't want to spend more. The girlfriend's reaction was that he was faking sadness to manipulate her, which is a serious accusation. The author then ignored her and left for the trip. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, Valentine's Day can be a big deal, and some people expect certain gestures. However, the couple has been together for over a year, so they might have established their own norms. The fact that the girlfriend expected more because he was missing the actual day might be a valid point, but the amount spent could be subjective. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not communicating better. He assumed his gifts were enough, but she felt they weren't. However, the girlfriend's response might be unreasonable given the amount he spent. Also, her accusation of manipulation is harsh and could be a miscommunication. \n\nThe author's decision to ignore her and leave might have been hurtful. Even if he was disappointed, cutting off communication during a conflict isn't ideal. That could be seen as avoiding the issue, which might be where he's in the wrong. \n\nBut if he was genuinely confused and hurt, maybe his reaction was understandable. The key is whether his actions were wrong. If he didn't do anything that could be objectively wrong, like not showing up for dinner or not giving any gifts, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, not addressing her feelings adequately could be a point against him. \n\nIn terms of financial responsibility, spending $1k on gifts when he's earning $85k isn't excessive. But if the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, there's a communication issue. The author's response to her disappointment by saying he thought it was sufficient isn't wrong per se, but the way he handled the conflict might be problematic. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author's actions were wrong in the context of their relationship dynamics. If the girlfriend had different expectations and he didn't meet them, it's a mutual misunderstanding rather than one side being clearly wrong. But since the question is about the author's wrongness, if he didn't violate any clear boundaries or make a harmful decision, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if his reaction to her disappointment was dismissive or hurtful, that could tip it to A (wrong). \n\nConsidering all factors, the author did his part in spending a considerable amount, but mishandled the conflict. However, since the girlfriend's expectations were higher, but the author's actions were not objectively wrong, the answer might be B. But if the way he handled the situation (ignoring her, leaving abruptly) is considered wrong, maybe A. The key is whether the author's actions were in the wrong in terms of the situation, not just the conflict resolution. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he made an effort and the disagreement is more about differing expectations rather than a clear mistake.\n"
