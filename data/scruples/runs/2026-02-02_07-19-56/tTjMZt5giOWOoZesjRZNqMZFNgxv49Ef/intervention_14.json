I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this AITA situation. The author, a guy, spent over $1000 on his girlfriend for Valentine's Day, but she was disappointed because he was traveling and she expected more since he earns around $85k. He got gifts, a dinner, roses, etc. She felt he should have spent more, and there was an argument. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author did spend a significant amount, which is a lot of money, especially for a yearly income of $85k. However, she might have had higher expectations because he was missing the actual day. But is $1100 not enough? That's about 1.3% of his annual income. It's a substantial amount for a gift, even for someone making that much.\n\nShe criticized him for not spending enough, and he felt hurt. His reaction was to get sad and then ignore her. She accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. That sounds like a harsh response. The author might have overstepped by being dismissive, but she also set expectations that weren't met. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe he should have discussed her expectations beforehand. But she might also need to recognize the effort he made. The author's defense is that he spent a lot, but she wanted more. However, the way he handled the argument by ignoring her might have been wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not meeting her expectations or for his reaction. \n\nI think the issue is more about differing expectations rather than the author being outright wrong. He did put in effort and money, but she felt it wasn't enough. The key points are communication and understanding each other's needs. The author's response (ignoring her) wasn't great, but the core issue is about expectations. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he made an effort, but there's room for both to communicate better. However, if the standard is meeting her expectations despite the spending, then maybe A. But since he spent a lot, and she's being unreasonable, B seems right.\n"
