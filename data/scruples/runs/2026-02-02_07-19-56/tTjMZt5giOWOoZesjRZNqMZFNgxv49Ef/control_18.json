I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day, despite spending over $1,000. They missed the actual day because of a business trip but had a dinner beforehand.\n\nFirst, the author's spending seems generous. $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. That's a lot of money, especially for someone making $85k. But the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough because he was missing the actual holiday and he makes \"a lot of money.\" The author got sad and felt like his efforts were dismissed, leading to some tension.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong for not meeting the girlfriend's expectations. From a perspective of fairness, the author did spend a significant amount. However, the girlfriend's expectations might be influenced by the missed holiday and her perception of his income. The author tried to make up for missing the day with a dinner and gifts, but she still felt disappointed. \n\nThe author's response when she expressed disappointment\u2014getting sad and then ignoring her\u2014might not have been the best approach. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not buying more gifts. The key points are the effort made, the financial commitment, and the communication breakdown. \n\nSince the author's spending was substantial, and the girlfriend's expectations were not met despite that, it's more about differing expectations rather than wrongdoing. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not exceeding what he already did, especially since he couldn't be there for the actual day. The answer is B.\n"
