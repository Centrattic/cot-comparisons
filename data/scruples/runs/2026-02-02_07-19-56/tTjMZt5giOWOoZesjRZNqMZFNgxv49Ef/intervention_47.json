I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a Valentine's Day gift-giving scenario where the guy spent a lot of money but his girlfriend was still disappointed because he missed the actual day and she expected more given his income.\n\nFirst, the guy spent around $1,100 on gifts, dinner, and flowers. He thought that was sufficient, especially since he's on track to make $85k. The girlfriend, however, felt he should have spent more since he's missing the day and he earns a decent income. The guy got upset and felt she was being unfair, leading to an argument where he accused her of manipulating him by pretending to be upset. He then ignored her and left for his trip, while she took an Uber home.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy spent a significant amount but the girlfriend expected even more. The guy's reaction was to get sad and shut her out, which she perceived as manipulative. The question is whether he's wrong.\n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, relationships often involve communication and understanding. The guy might have thought he did enough, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. The issue could be that he didn't consider her expectations, especially since he was aware he'd be missing the actual day. However, he did make an effort by having dinner and spending a lot. On the other hand, his reaction of getting sad and ignoring her, then leaving abruptly, might come off as dismissive. Also, accusing her of manipulating him might have escalated things.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. Both parties have valid perspectives. The girlfriend might not have communicated her expectations clearly, and the guy might not have checked in with her to ensure he met her needs. However, the guy's response was to shut down instead of addressing the issue, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that he left abruptly and didn't try to resolve the conflict during the dinner might be where he went wrong. Also, the argument about his income\u2014$85k isn't as high as one might think, especially if he's 22 and just starting out. The girlfriend's expectation that he should spend more because of his income might be unrealistic.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often the case that both sides have some responsibility, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author here might be at fault for not fully addressing his GF's feelings and for the way he reacted. The key is whether his actions were dismissive or not. Since he said he felt she was manipulating him, that could be seen as blaming her instead of taking responsibility. So, the answer might lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of his reaction, even though his spending was generous.\n"
