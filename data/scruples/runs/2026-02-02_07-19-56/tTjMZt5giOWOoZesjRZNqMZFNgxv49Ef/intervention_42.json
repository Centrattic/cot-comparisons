I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves Valentine's Day gifts when the author is going on a business trip. The author spent $1,100 on various gifts, dinner, roses, etc., but the girlfriend was disappointed because he missed the actual day and thought he should have spent more. The author is upset because he spent a lot of money and feels she's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author spent a significant amount, but the GF expected more because he was missing the actual day. The author's income is around $85k, which is a high salary, so perhaps the GF expected a higher spending. The author felt the amount was appropriate, but the GF was disappointed. The argument escalated with the GF accusing the author of faking sadness to manipulate her. The author ignored her and left for the trip.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions. He made an effort with a substantial gift, but maybe the GF wanted something different or more personalized. Missing the actual day might have made her feel neglected, even with the gifts. The author's spending could be seen as generous, but the GF's reaction might be about the missed time rather than the money. The argument might stem from unmet expectations about how to express love. The author's response of ignoring her and leaving might not have resolved the issue constructively. However, the GF's accusation of manipulation could be harsh. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author might not be entirely at fault, but there could be room for improvement in communication. The key question is whether the author's effort was sufficient given the circumstances. Since the GF felt disappointed despite the spending, there might be a mismatch in expectations. However, the author's actions were thoughtful, and the GF's reaction might be overly critical. The answer might hinge on whether the author's gifts were adequate for the relationship's needs, but since he made an effort, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the GF's needs weren't met, he might share some responsibility. Hmm.\n"
