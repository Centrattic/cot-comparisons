I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy, who's 22, has a girlfriend who's 20. They've been together for over a year. He's going on a business trip right before Valentine's Day, so they had a dinner that night to celebrate. He spent around $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a 5-foot teddy bear, Godiva chocolates, a dozen roses, a card, and paid for an expensive dinner. But she was disappointed because he missed the actual Valentine's Day and expected more given his income (he's making $85k this year). He felt surprised and hurt because he thought he did a lot, and she accused him of manipulating her by faking sadness. He left without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are about expectations in relationships regarding gift-giving, especially for Valentine's Day, and communication. \n\nHe spent a significant amount of money, which is a lot, but she felt it wasn't enough. The fact that he's making $85k might be a point she's using to argue that he can spend more. But he's probably still in his early career, and $1,100 is a big chunk for someone earning that. However, relationships often involve mutual expectations. Maybe she felt that because he was missing V Day, the gesture needed to be bigger. Or perhaps there's a communication issue where their expectations weren't aligned beforehand.\n\nHe did make an effort to celebrate with dinner and gifts, but she still felt let down. The argument about faking sadness might be a point where he didn't handle the emotional response well. But the root issue could be miscommunication about what each expects from Valentine's Day, especially when one person is absent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he didn't realize she wanted something different or more, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if they usually have certain traditions and he changed it without discussing, that could be a problem. However, the situation says they made up for it with a dinner, so maybe it's more about the value of the gifts. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. Spending $1k is a lot, and $85k is a decent salary, but maybe she expects more for V Day, especially when he's not there. But is that unreasonable? It's subjective. The author might not be in the wrong because he made an effort, but perhaps they need to talk more about expectations. However, the way he left without resolving the issue might have been dismissive, but he was going on a trip. \n\nSo considering all that, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might have a valid point that $1k is a lot, but the girlfriend's disappointment suggests her expectations weren't met. However, the author's response (getting sad, then ignoring her) could be seen as not handling the situation well. But the core issue is about differing expectations. If he's not at fault for not knowing her expectations, then maybe not in the wrong. Alternatively, if partners should communicate their needs, then maybe he's partially responsible for not knowing. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider intent. The author tried to compensate with a big dinner and gifts, so he might not be in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend felt it was insufficient, there's a communication breakdown. But the author's actions were an attempt to make up for missing V Day. \n\nSo, probably, the author isn't in the wrong (B) because he made a significant effort, and the girlfriend's expectations were higher, but there's room for both sides to communicate better.\n"
