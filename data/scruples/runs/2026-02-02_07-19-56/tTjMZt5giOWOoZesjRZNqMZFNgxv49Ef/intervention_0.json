I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old guy with a 20-year-old girlfriend they've been together for over a year. He's going on a business trip starting tomorrow, so they had a dinner tonight as a substitute. He spent around $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and an expensive dinner. However, his girlfriend was disappointed because he missed actual Valentine's Day and thought he should have spent more given his income of $85k. The author felt wronged, said he thought he did well, and got into an argument where the girl accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. The author is now asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both perspectives. The author spent a significant amount of money, which is a considerable portion of his income. He tried to make up for missing Valentine's Day by having a dinner. However, the girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and thought his spending wasn't enough relative to his income. The key points here are the girlfriend's expectations versus the author's actions. \n\nThe girlfriend's disappointment could be seen as valid if she values being present on Valentine's Day highly, which is common. The fact that he was on a business trip might be a legitimate reason for missing the day, but the girlfriend might feel that the effort to make up for it wasn't sufficient. However, the author did spend a lot, which is more than many people might do. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. She was annoyed and accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. The author's feelings of being wronged might stem from the fact that he put in effort and money, yet she still felt unappreciated. \n\nFrom a general perspective, relationships require mutual understanding and communication. The author might not be in the wrong because he did make an effort, but there's a communication breakdown here. The girlfriend's expectations weren't clear, and the author might not have known she wanted more. However, the fact that he missed the actual day could be a point where he could have done more, but realistically, being on a business trip is a constraint. \n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. Spending $1,100 is a lot, especially for someone earning $85k a year. However, if the girlfriend expects even more, that's a personal expectation. The author might feel that $1,100 is excessive, but if the girlfriend is expecting more, maybe he should have discussed that. However, the argument escalated into her accusing him of manipulation, which is probably not fair.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, Valentine's Day can be a high-pressure day for gift-giving, and missing it can lead to disappointment. The author tried to compensate, but the girlfriend's reaction suggests deeper issues beyond just the gifts. Maybe there's an expectation of being there in person, which is understandable. However, the author's job required him to travel, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe key question is whether the author failed to meet reasonable expectations. Given that he made a significant financial effort, maybe he isn't in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the argument might point to a mismatch in expectations. The author's sadness and the girlfriend's accusation of faking sadness might indicate a lack of communication or understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author made a substantial effort, the girlfriend's disappointment led to conflict. The author's actions might not be in the wrong because he did spend a lot and made an effort, but the lack of communication about expectations could be a mutual issue. However, the girlfriend's harsh reaction, including accusing him of manipulation, might be the main problem here. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but both sides have points. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he made a significant effort, and the girlfriend's expectations were not met due to circumstances beyond his control.\n"
