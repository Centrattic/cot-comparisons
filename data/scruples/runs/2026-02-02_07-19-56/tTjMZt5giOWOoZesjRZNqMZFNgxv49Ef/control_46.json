I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (M22) is in the wrong for not buying enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The key points here are the gifts he got and the responses from his girlfriend.\n\nHe spent around $1,100, which includes a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant. He was going on a business trip, so they had dinner instead. The girlfriend was disappointed because he was missing the actual day and mentioned his income. She thought he should have spent more. The author felt it was a lot, especially since he's making $85k a year, which he mentions is not that much. The girlfriend accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her, which led to a fight.\n\nFirst, the value of the gifts: $1,100 is a significant amount. For some people, that might be a lot, but others might expect more depending on their relationship dynamics or personal expectations. The girlfriend's disappointment might be due to the fact that he's missing the actual day, so maybe she wanted something different or more symbolic for the day itself. However, he made up for it with a dinner and gifts the night before.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important. She felt he should have spent more, possibly because of his income. The author might not feel that $1,100 is a small amount, but in the context of his salary, she might think he could afford more. This could be a case of differing expectations based on financial perspectives. The author's response when she expressed disappointment was to get sad and then ignored her. The girlfriend felt manipulated when he faked sadness, which might have been a defense mechanism, but coming off as dismissive or not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The author did spend a considerable amount, but maybe the girlfriend's expectations were higher because of the circumstances (missing the actual day) and his income. However, the author's reaction to her disappointment\u2014feeling sad and then ignoring her\u2014might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's accusation of manipulation suggests that communication was an issue. The author might not be entirely wrong for spending a lot, but his reaction could have been better. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's expectations were clearly communicated beforehand, maybe the author didn't meet them, making him at fault. But since he was away, maybe trying to compensate with dinner and gifts wasn't enough for her. It's a bit of a gray area, but considering the arguments, the author might be in the wrong for not fully addressing her expectations and for the way he responded to her disappointment.\n"
