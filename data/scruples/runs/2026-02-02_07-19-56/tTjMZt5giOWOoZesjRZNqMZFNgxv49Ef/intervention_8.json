I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts on Valentine's Day. They were going on a trip and had a dinner to make up for missing V Day. They spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big bear, chocolates, roses, a card, and dinner. The girlfriend was disappointed, expecting more since he's missing the actual day and he earns $85k a year. The guy got sad, she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. He left, she took an Uber home.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's the case. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nValentine's Day can be a sensitive time, and expectations can vary. The guy put in a lot, spending over a thousand dollars, which is significant. However, the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, especially since he was missing the actual day. The key points here are communication and expectations. Did they discuss what she wanted before? If the guy assumed that the dinner and the gifts would suffice, but she expected more for the actual day, maybe there was a miscommunication. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's making $85k (even if it's his first year, that's a decent salary for a 22-year-old) might make the girlfriend feel like he should spend more. But the guy's perspective is that he's already spent a lot, more than he's earned in a year. That's a valid point too. \n\nThe argument escalated when he got sad, and she accused him of faking it. That could be a hurtful response. Maybe she was frustrated and expressed it poorly, but the guy's reaction of ignoring her and leaving might have been dismissive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy tried to make amends by having dinner and buying gifts, but maybe didn't consider that she might want something specific for the actual day. The girlfriend's expectation might have been unrealistic given the amount he's already spent. However, not discussing expectations beforehand could be a mutual issue. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, yes, then it's because he didn't meet her expectations despite knowing he'd be away. If B, no, because he did put in a lot and the expectations might be unreasonable. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong. He made an effort, but there was a lack of communication. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, and his response of getting sad and leaving might not be the best, but it's a heated moment. So maybe B.\n"
