I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The author, a 22-year-old guy, spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend for a dinner and some gifts. He missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip, so they had dinner the night before. The girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and thought he should have spent more given his income (he makes $85k this year). The author feels he did enough, but she was upset, leading to some arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author spent a significant amount, especially considering his income is $85k. $1,100 is almost 1.3% of his yearly income, which isn't bad. But maybe the girlfriend expected more because it's Valentine's Day and he was missing it. However, it's also important to note that expectations can vary. The girlfriend might value presence over gifts, so missing the day could amplify her disappointment. \n\nThe author got multiple gifts, which seems generous, but perhaps the girlfriend felt that material gifts weren't enough, especially since he wasn't there on the actual day. However, the author's argument is that he spent a lot and that he's not making that much money yet. The girlfriend accused him of faking sadness, which might indicate a communication issue. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt he met his expectations based on past experience. On the other hand, if the girlfriend had different expectations and didn't communicate them clearly before, then the author might not be at fault. Alternatively, maybe the author should have anticipated her need for more gestures since he was missing the day. \n\nBut considering that he already spent a considerable amount, maybe the issue is more about the girlfriend's expectations not aligning with the author's efforts. The author might not be in the wrong if he did his best within his capacity and the girlfriend's reaction is unreasonable. However, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt unappreciated despite the gifts, then the author might need to consider her feelings more. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response of saying he shouldn't be sad and that he's manipulating her by faking sadness seems harsh. That could be her overreacting. The author's reaction to ignore her and leave might be a bit abrupt, but given that he had to go to the airport, maybe it's a way to avoid further conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. But generally, if someone spends a lot and the other person is still upset, sometimes it's about communication and understanding each other's needs. The author might not be in the wrong because he made a good effort, but maybe he could have done more to address her need for presence. However, since he was on a business trip, that's out of his control. So the blame isn't entirely on him. The girlfriend's reaction might be a bit high-handed. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
