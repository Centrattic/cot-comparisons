I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The author is a guy, 22, in a one-year relationship with his girlfriend. He's going on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day, so they had a dinner to make up for it. He spent around $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. But his girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and she expected more, especially since he makes around $85k. He felt he did enough, got upset, and she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. He left, and she took an Uber home.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. First, the author made an effort by spending a significant amount, which is a lot for a young person. But the girlfriend expected more because he wasn't there on the actual day. Maybe she wanted more thoughtful or personal gestures instead of expensive gifts? Or perhaps she felt he didn't prioritize her enough by being away? But he did spend a lot, so maybe she's used to more or values presence over material gifts. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not realize that her disappointment wasn't about the amount spent but the absence. Since he was on a business trip, maybe she wanted him to make other arrangements for the actual day, like a surprise or a video call. His response of getting sad and feeling hurt might have been a way to deflect or show his perspective, but she found that manipulative. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did make an effort, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings of missing the actual day. If absence was more important to her, then just replacing it with an expensive dinner might not have been enough. However, he did spend a significant amount and tried to make up for it. The conflict here is about differing expectations. The girlfriend expected more, but he felt he did enough. \n\nThe key points are understanding each other's needs. The author might be in the wrong if he didn't communicate or listen to her feelings, but he did try to make it up. Alternatively, she might be unreasonable in her expectations given the circumstances. The answer depends on whether the standard is about effort vs. presence. Given that he was on a business trip, maybe he couldn't be there, but her disappointment stems from that absence. His reaction of getting upset might have been inappropriate, but he was hurt. The question is if his actions were wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't address her feelings properly and instead reacted with sadness, maybe he's at fault. However, she accused him of manipulation, which is a serious accusation. The author's decision to leave and say they'll talk later might not resolve the issue. \n\nI think both parties have some responsibility here. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might depend on whose perspective is more valid. The author's spending was generous, but maybe he didn't address her emotional need for presence. However, he couldn't be there, so maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, he could have made different arrangements. The girlfriend's reaction might be harsh, but her feelings are valid. \n\nSo, considering all this, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he made a significant effort and tried to compensate, but it's a close call. However, if the focus is on her feeling unappreciated due to absence, then maybe he did have some fault in not considering that. But given the information, the author's actions might not be in the wrong.\n"
