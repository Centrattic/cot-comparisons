I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent $1,100 on his girlfriend, but she was disappointed because he wasn't there on actual Valentine's Day and expected more. He was on a business trip, so they had dinner earlier. She thought he should have spent more because he's making $85k/year. He got a Tiffany bracelet, a big bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and paid for dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy spent a significant amount, over a thousand dollars, which is a lot. His job is keeping him away on V-Day, so he tried to make up for it with the dinner and gifts. But the girlfriend was disappointed, maybe because she wanted more or expected him to be there. She thinks he should have spent more given his income and the fact that he was missing the day. \n\nHe felt hurt when she accused him of faking sadness and manipulating her. He ignored her and left for his trip. Now the user thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to evaluate if his actions were wrong. The key points are communication and expectations. Maybe they didn't discuss what each expected from the relationship. The guy thought $1k was enough, but she wanted more. Money can be a sensitive topic. Was it wrong to spend that much but not meet her expectations? Or was she unreasonable in expecting more when he already spent a lot?\n\nThe guy's defense is that he spent $1k, which is a substantial amount, and he's earning $85k. But maybe in her view, since he's missing the day and making that income, he should have spent even more. However, $1k is a significant portion of his annual income. \n\nThe guy tried to make it up by having the dinner and gifts. The fact that she was disappointed might indicate unmet expectations. However, he did put effort and money into it. The argument about manipulating emotions by faking sadness might depend on his intent. If he was genuinely upset, her accusation could be harsh. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since both sides have valid points, but the root issue is communication. If they hadn't discussed expectations beforehand, it's hard to say one is entirely wrong. However, the guy did make an effort, and the girlfriend might be unrealistic in her expectations. Alternatively, he might not have communicated why he thought $1k was sufficient. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who causes the other to feel bad is at fault. But here, the girlfriend's reaction was out of proportion to his effort. The guy spent a lot but she wanted more, and he was hurt by her accusations. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the guy's actions were insufficient. Since he spent a lot and tried to make up for missing the day, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she expected more and felt neglected, that's another side. However, the fact that he made a genuine effort might mean he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
