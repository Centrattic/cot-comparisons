I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about Valentine's Day gifts.\n\nFirst, the author spent around $1,100 on gifts, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big bear, chocolates, roses, and a fancy dinner. The GF was disappointed because he was missing V Day on the actual day and thought he should have spent more, considering his income. The author got sad and felt his efforts weren't appreciated, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are expectations and communication. The GF expected more, possibly because he was absent on the actual day. The author might not have realized that even a large amount, the timing and maybe the type of gifts mattered. The GF's reaction might be about feeling undervalued when he couldn't be there. But the author did make an effort to compensate with a dinner and gifts. However, the GF might have different expectations. The argument here is whether the effort was enough. The author's defense is that he spent a lot and was on a business trip. The GF's side is that absence requires more, and her feeling disappointed is valid. The author's response of getting sad and implying she's manipulative might have hurt her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, expectations can vary. If the author didn't communicate his reasons for not spending more (like the trip), maybe he's at fault. But he did make an effort. However, the GF might feel that when someone is absent, the gestures need to be bigger. The author's reaction (getting sad, ignoring her) might be seen as dismissive. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't meet her emotional needs, even if he did spend a lot. But some might argue that the amount spent was significant and the trip was unavoidable. \n\nBut the GF's feeling that her expectations weren't met is valid. The author might have failed to recognize that the value of the gift wasn't just monetary but also about presence. So, the author is partially at fault for not understanding her emotional needs and for reacting poorly. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
