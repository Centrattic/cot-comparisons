I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who spent a lot on Valentine's Day gifts but missed the actual day due to a business trip. His girlfriend was disappointed and expected more because he makes a decent income.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The guy spent over $1,100 on several gifts and a dinner. That's a significant amount, especially for someone making $85k. He thought he was being generous. The girlfriend, however, felt that since he was missing V-Day, he should have given more, considering his income. \n\nThe key points here are expectations around gift-giving, especially when one person is absent. The guy might have thought that the gifts he gave on the dinner night were sufficient as a substitute. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have felt that the absence from V-Day itself required more compensation. \n\nThe author claims he's not at fault, but the girlfriend feels let down. The author's reaction\u2014getting sad and then the girlfriend accusing him of faking sadness\u2014adds tension. The author then left for the trip, and she took an Uber home.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, some might argue that Valentine's Day is a specific day, and missing it might require more effort. But others might see the $1k spent as more than enough, especially when you factor in the time and effort of planning a dinner. The girlfriend's expectations could be influenced by her perception of his income, even though he's not making a huge salary. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not communicating his intentions better. He might have assumed that the gifts were enough, but she needed more emotional or symbolic gestures. Alternatively, she might be setting unrealistic expectations based on his income. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for spending a lot. The issue is more about differing expectations. However, since the author is asking if he's at fault, and the girlfriend is upset, maybe there's a lesson in communication. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not meeting her expectations if he believed he did enough. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for spending a lot and missing the day, but there's room for better communication. The girlfriend's expectations might be unreasonable given his income and the amount already spent. The author's actions don't make him the asshole here.\n"
