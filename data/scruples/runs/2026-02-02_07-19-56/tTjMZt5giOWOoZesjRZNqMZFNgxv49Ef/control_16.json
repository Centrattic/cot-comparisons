I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 22-year-old guy with a 20-year-old girlfriend. They've been together over a year. He's going on a business trip for a week and misses Valentine's Day. To make up for it, he spent about $1,100 on gifts and dinner. The gifts include a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, a dozen roses, a card, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. However, his girlfriend was disappointed because he missed the actual day and he makes a lot of money (85k income). She felt he should have spent more, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author is confused because he thought the gifts were good, but she wasn't satisfied. He got sad and defensive, which she interpreted as manipulation. He left for his trip, and they agreed to talk later.\n\nTo determine if he's in the wrong, I need to assess expectations in the relationship. The girlfriend expected more because he was missing the actual V Day and his income. The author argues that he spent a lot, but maybe the issue is about the timing. Valentine's Day is a specific day, and even though he tried to compensate with a dinner the night before, she might still value the actual date more. \n\nAlso, communication seems key here. The author might not have discussed expectations beforehand, leading to unmet expectations. However, spending over $1k is significant, especially for someone making 85k. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests that her emotional response to missing the day wasn't addressed adequately. \n\nIs it his fault? Maybe. If the couple didn't communicate their expectations, the author should have considered that missing the day might require a different gesture, not just equivalent spending. But he did make an effort with gifts and dinner. However, her feeling that his income should allow for more might be a point where he's expected to spend more, which he might not be willing to. \n\nThere's also the dynamic of the argument. The author's sadness and defensiveness might have escalated things, but the girlfriend's claim that he's manipulating by faking sadness adds another layer. It's possible that the girlfriend's reaction was overly harsh given the amount spent, but the author might have failed to understand her emotional needs around the holiday. \n\nIn the AITA context, sometimes the issue is about perspective. The author might not be in the wrong if he followed through with a thoughtful gesture, but the girlfriend's expectations could be unrealistic. However, if he didn't consider that missing the actual day might require a different approach, he might share some responsibility. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend is being unreasonable in her expectations given the author's spending, then she's at fault. But in relationships, both parties need to communicate their needs. The author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author made a significant effort and spent a considerable amount. The girlfriend's expectations might not be realistic, and the author can't be blamed for the miscommunication. However, there's room for both sides to improve communication.\n"
