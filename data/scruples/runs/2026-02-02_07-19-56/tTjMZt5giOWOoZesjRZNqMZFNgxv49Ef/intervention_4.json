I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation involves a guy who spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant, and a card. He missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip and had dinner with her the night before. She was disappointed, thinking he should have spent more given his income, and he felt hurt, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author spent a significant amount, which shows he put effort into making up for missing the actual day. However, his girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. The key points here are communication and expectations. Did they discuss expectations beforehand? The author might have assumed his gestures were sufficient, but the girlfriend had higher expectations, possibly due to her feelings about the missed day or her perception of his income.\n\nThe author's reaction to her disappointment\u2014getting sad and then ignoring her\u2014might have been a mistake. He could have tried to understand her feelings better instead of becoming defensive. However, his argument that he spent a lot and doesn't make that much income is valid. The term \"manipulation\" is strong here; maybe he was hurt and expressed it in a way that seemed fake sadness.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction could be about unmet expectations. Maybe she felt the gifts weren't thoughtful enough, or she wanted something more personal instead of expensive items. Her saying he's an asshole might be an overreaction, but if she felt disrespected, that's a valid emotion.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because he made effort, but he could have handled the situation better by listening more and not getting defensive. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the context, the answer might be A (Yes) if the main issue is his poor communication and defensiveness, but if the main issue is about gift spending, maybe B (No). But given the girlfriend's perspective and the fact that he didn't adequately address her feelings, A might be the better answer. But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe it's a 50/50 situation, but typically in these scenarios, the person is often found not in the wrong if they made an effort. However, the way he handled the conflict after might tip the scales.\n"
