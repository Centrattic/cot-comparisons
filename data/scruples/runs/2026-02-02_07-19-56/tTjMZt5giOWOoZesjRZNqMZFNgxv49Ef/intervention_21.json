I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts.\n\nSo the guy spent about $1,100 on his girlfriend, which included a Tiffany bracelet, a big bear, chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant. He thought that was a lot, especially since he's making $85k a year. But his girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on actual Valentine's Day and he should have spent more. She got annoyed and accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her.\n\nHmm, the guy is in the wrong? Or not? Let's break it down. First, he made an effort to compensate for missing the actual day by spending a significant amount. $1,100 is a lot, especially for someone earning $85k a year. But maybe she expected even more because he was gone? However, money isn't everything. Maybe she felt the gesture wasn't thoughtful enough? Or maybe she wanted different types of gifts? The guy got physical gifts and a dinner, which are traditional, but maybe she wanted something more personal or experiential?\n\nHe got kind of sad and maybe defensive when she expressed disappointment. Then he ignored her and left. That might have been a mistake in communication. Arguing about gifts right before a business trip could add stress. Also, accusing her of manipulating him by faking sadness might have come off as dismissive or not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, spending over $1k is a big deal. If he felt he did his best and she still wasn't happy, maybe there's a mismatch in expectations. But he also needs to consider her perspective. If she felt that his absence required more thoughtfulness, maybe he didn't meet her emotional needs. However, the amount he spent seems generous, so maybe she's being unreasonable.\n\nThe key points: Was the amount insufficient? Is the way he reacted wrong? Maybe both sides have some issues. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's mistake was not meeting her expectations despite the high spending, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he should have communicated better or understood her expectations ahead of time, then he might be. The fact that he got defensive and tried to leave might be seen as avoiding the conversation, which could be his fault.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He made a good effort with the gifts, but perhaps there was a communication breakdown. His reaction might have been immature, but the main issue is the expectation mismatch. So answer B (No).\n"
