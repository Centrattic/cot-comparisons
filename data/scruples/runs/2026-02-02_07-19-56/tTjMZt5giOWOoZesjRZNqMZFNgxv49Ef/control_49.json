I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent $1,100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner, and a card. He missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip and tried to compensate with a dinner that night. The girlfriend was disappointed, expecting more since he makes $85k a year. He got upset, she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her, and they ended up in a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The guy spent a significant amount, which is more than his annual income. But he's making $85k, so $1k is a large chunk. The girlfriend felt it wasn't enough because he was away on V-Day. But the guy might feel he did enough, especially since he's not making that much. \n\nCommunication is key here. Maybe the girlfriend had different expectations. She might value presence over gifts, or maybe she wanted more extravagant gifts. The guy tried to make up for missing the day with dinner and gifts, but she wasn't satisfied. \n\nIs the guy wrong? He spent a lot, but maybe didn't meet her emotional needs. However, the money spent is a lot, and he's not super wealthy. She's in the wrong for expecting more than he could comfortably afford? Or is he in the wrong for not understanding her expectations? \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction: she took an Uber home, he ignored her. He might have overreacted by being sad, but she accused him of manipulation. It's possible both have faults, but the question is about the author. \n\nThe main issue is whether he was wrong for not spending more. Since he already spent over a thousand, which is more than his income for a year, it's reasonable he thought it was enough. The problem might be in the communication of expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for not spending more; the girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
