I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation is that the author missed V-Day due to a business trip and spent around $1,100 on gifts and dinner. The girlfriend expected more because he was making $85k and wasn't there on the actual day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author spent a significant amount, which might seem generous. But the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, especially since he missed the actual day and his income. The key points are the expectations around gift-giving, the significance of V-Day, and the communication between them.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if the spending was appropriate for their relationship. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that his absence warranted more, and she felt her needs weren't met. The author's reaction of getting sad and then ignoring her could come off as dismissive. Maybe there's a lack of understanding of each other's expectations. \n\nBut is the author wrong for not spending more? It's subjective. Gift-giving is personal, and what's enough for one person isn't for another. The author might have thought $1k was sufficient, but the girlfriend felt he could do more given his income. The manipulation claim is tricky. If the author was genuinely upset, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. However, the author not addressing the issue properly might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication and understanding each other's expectations. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that both could have communicated better.\n"
