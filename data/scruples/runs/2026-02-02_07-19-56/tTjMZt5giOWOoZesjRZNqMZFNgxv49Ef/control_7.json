I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 20, they've been together a year. He's going on a business trip, so he missed actual Valentine's Day and had a dinner the previous night. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. The girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on V-Day even though he made up for it with the dinner and gifts. She mentioned he makes a lot (85k on track) and thought he should have spent more. The guy felt he did a good job, got sad, and the girl accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. He left without talking more.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault. The guy spent a significant amount, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. The key points here are expectations around Valentine's Day and communication. The guy tried to make up for missing the day by having dinner, but maybe the girlfriend wanted something else? Or maybe she expected more because he was absent. However, he's making $85k, which is a decent salary, but he's only 22. Depending on his expenses, $1,100 could be a lot or not. But the girlfriend's reaction seems harsh\u2014he spent over a thousand dollars and provided a nice dinner. The fact that she said he should have spent more and accused him of manipulating her by faking sadness is a bit harsh. The guy's response was to ignore her and leave, which isn't great communication either. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he tried to compensate by spending money, but maybe the girlfriend wanted different gestures instead of just material gifts when he was away. However, he did miss V-Day, and she's disappointed. But he's also a young person with a salary that's growing. Maybe the girlfriend's expectations are unreasonable. On the other hand, the guy's reaction of getting sad and then ignoring her might not help. But the core issue is their communication of expectations. If he didn't know she wanted more because he was away, maybe it's a miscommunication. But he did buy a lot, so the girlfriend's reaction might be unfair. \n\nSo the answer would depend on whether the girlfriend's expectations were communicated clearly. If she didn't tell him she wanted more because he was missing V-Day, then she's partly at fault. But the guy could have checked in more. However, since he spent a lot and she's still disappointed, maybe the issue is about the type of gifts versus absence. The key is that he tried to make up for it, but she still felt shortchanged. In that case, maybe the girl is in the wrong. However, the guy's response of getting defensive and leaving might not be great, but the main question is whether he's in the wrong for not buying enough. Since he did spend a lot, maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
