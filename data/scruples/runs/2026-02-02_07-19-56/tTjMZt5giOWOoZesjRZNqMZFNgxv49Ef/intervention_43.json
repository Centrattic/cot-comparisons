I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner, etc. He missed V-Day because of a business trip and had dinner as a substitute. The girlfriend was disappointed and thought he should have spent more, especially since he earns $85k a year. The guy got sad, and she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy spent a significant amount, which is more than his annual income. That's a lot, but maybe she expected even more because of his salary? But wait, $85k is his track for the year, so $1,100 is about 1.3% of his income. Maybe she felt that since he earns more, he should spend more? But he's spending a lot already. \n\nThen there's the missed V-Day. They had dinner as a replacement, which he did. She might have wanted more gestures specifically on the actual day. He tried to make up for it, but maybe the timing was an issue. She expected more than just the dinner and gifts. Also, the way he reacted when she expressed her disappointment\u2014getting sad and maybe not communicating well. She felt annoyed and thought he was manipulating her by faking sadness. That could be a communication problem on his part. \n\nIs the issue about the amount spent or the intent? The guy might feel he did enough, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he thought he did enough but she felt wronged, maybe he should have considered her feelings more. However, she's also being critical about his spending when it's a significant amount. \n\nBut the key point here is that he's spending over a grand, which is a lot. If she expected more, maybe she should have communicated better. But he might not have known her expectations. However, when she expressed disappointment, his reaction of getting sad and maybe deflecting could have been hurtful. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction: calling him manipulative for faking sadness could be harsh. But she had the right to express her feelings. The problem is whether the author's actions were wrong. He did spend a lot, but maybe didn't meet her expectations, but is that his fault? If he didn't know what she wanted, maybe it's not entirely his fault, but perhaps he should have asked or considered more. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually looks at intent and whether the person acted unkindly. The author tried to make up for missing V-Day, but maybe the girlfriend's expectations were higher. However, the author's reaction of getting sad and the argument might not be his fault. But the fact that he spent a lot and she still felt wronged could mean that he didn't fully understand her needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because he put effort and money into it, but there's room for both sides. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he might have a valid perspective, the answer might be B. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is more about her own expectations, but the author could have handled it better. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A, but I'm conflicted. Let me check the details again. The author's actions were generous, but perhaps he didn't meet her specific expectations. But is that his fault? It depends on communication. If he didn't know, then maybe not. However, in relationships, sometimes partners expect certain things. If he missed the mark, maybe he's partially at fault. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he tried and spent a lot, maybe not. So I'll go with B.\n"
