I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts and spending.\n\nSo, the guy is male, 22, his girlfriend is 20, they've been together over a year. He's going on a business trip, missing V Day, so they had dinner. He bought her a Tiffany bracelet, a giant stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and paid for dinner. Total around $1,100. She was disappointed because he wasn't there on actual Valentine's Day and felt he should have spent more given his income (he's making $85k). He was surprised because he spent a lot, and he got sad, which she called manipulative. They ended up not talking much, he left for his trip, she took a taxi home.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A or B.\n\nHmm. First, communication is key. The guy spent a lot, but maybe she wanted different types of gifts or more quantity. But he thought he did a lot. Maybe he didn't communicate that he was missing V Day, but they had dinner to compensate. She expected more because he was away. But he's spending over a thousand on gifts. Maybe she expected more because he was away, but he's not making $1k per month yet (he's on track for $85k, which is about $7k/month). So spending $1.1k is a significant chunk, but maybe she feels he could do more. \n\nThe author is defensive, saying he thought he did well, and then gets upset when she's disappointed. He also accuses her of being annoyed and manipulative. The problem here might be that he didn't consider that her expectations were higher because he wasn't there on the actual day. Even if he spent a lot, maybe she wanted more because it was a make-up for missing V Day. \n\nBut is it wrong to not meet expectations beyond what he thought was appropriate? Or is it about miscommunication? He might have thought that the dinner plus the gifts were enough, but she wanted more. Maybe the issue is that he didn't ask her what she wanted or consider her feelings about missing the day. Also, his reaction of getting sad and then ignoring her might have been hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, spending $1k is a lot, especially for someone in their early 20s. Maybe her expectation is unreasonable. However, if she felt disappointed, his response could have been better. Instead of getting defensive and acting like it's her fault, maybe he should have tried to understand her perspective. \n\nThe key points: Did he fail to meet reasonable expectations? Or did she have unreasonable expectations? If he was away, perhaps the norm is to do something special even if it's not on the actual day, but the couple might have their own norms. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate their needs and expectations. If he didn't know she wanted more because he wasn't there, maybe it's his fault for not asking. But if she didn't communicate that clearly, then maybe she's at fault. However, he did ask her what was wrong when she seemed disappointed, and she told him she expected more. So he had a chance to respond. \n\nHis reaction of getting sad and then ignoring her might have been a poor way to handle it. Instead of trying to assert that he did enough, maybe he should have been more empathetic. Also, calling her manipulative could have been hurtful. \n\nIn terms of the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the author is partially at fault because he might not have considered that missing the actual day required more effort, and his reaction was dismissive. However, the spending was significant. But the main issue is his reaction rather than the gifts themselves. So maybe A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't meet her expectations despite knowing she was disappointed, and his response was poor. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) because he put in a lot and she had high expectations. \n\nThis is tricky. I think AITA often emphasizes communication and intentions. If he made an effort but maybe didn't consider her specific needs, he might be partially at fault. However, if the gifts were generous, maybe not. But since she expressed disappointment, he should have tried to address it, not just ignore and leave. So A, he is in the wrong for his reaction and not meeting her expectations.\n"
