I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent a lot of money ($1,100) on his girlfriend, but she was disappointed because he was going on a trip and missed the actual day. She expected more since he makes $85k a year. He felt he did enough and got upset when she was disappointed, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He spent over a thousand dollars, which is a significant amount. He thought that was enough, especially considering he's missing the actual day. The girlfriend, on the other hand, felt that because he's making a decent income, he should have spent even more. She got annoyed when he was upset and accused him of manipulating her by faking sadness.\n\nNow, the key points here. Did he do something wrong? Well, expectations can vary. Maybe she wanted more extravagant gifts or something specific that he didn't provide. The fact that he was going on a trip might mean she had different expectations for making up for missing the day. But he did spend a lot. The issue is communication. If he thought a thousand dollars was enough and she expected more, maybe there was a mismatch in expectations. However, the conflict escalated when he got sad and she accused him of faking sadness. His reaction might have been hurtful, but was he in the wrong?\n\nAlso, $85k a year isn't exactly a huge salary, especially for someone 22. Depending on location, that might be decent, but not enough to spend $1k+ on gifts without it being a stretch. So maybe she thought he could afford more. The author might not be wrong in thinking that was enough, but he could have communicated better. However, the way the argument went down\u2014him getting upset and her reacting negatively\u2014might indicate that both have some role. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering the actions: He spent a lot, tried to make up for missing the day. She had different expectations. He expressed his feelings when she was disappointed, which led to conflict. He didn't necessarily do anything wrong by not spending more if he felt it was enough. The wrong part would be if he ignored her feelings or didn't try to understand them. But he did ask her what was up. Maybe the problem is that he got defensive and sad instead of addressing her feelings. But again, it's a communication issue rather than a clear wrongdoing. So maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong), but the situation is more nuanced. The key is whether he did something objectively wrong, which seems not. The expectations differ, but spending $1k is a lot. The girlfriend might be unreasonable, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for not spending more. So answer B.\n"
