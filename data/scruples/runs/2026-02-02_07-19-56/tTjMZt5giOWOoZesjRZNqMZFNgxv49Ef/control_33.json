I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (M22) is in the wrong for not buying his girlfriend (GF) more gifts on Valentine's Day. The situation is that he's going on a business trip and missed the actual day, so they had dinner instead. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and an expensive dinner. The GF was disappointed because she expected more, considering he's making $85k a year.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The main issue is whether the author's spending was sufficient. The girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, especially because he missed V Day and he has a decent income. The author is confused and feels he did well, but the GF's reaction is causing tension.\n\nI should consider cultural or societal expectations around Valentine's Day. In some contexts, people might expect a grand gesture if the partner is absent. However, the amount the author spent is quite significant, especially for someone earning $85k. The GF might be coming from a place of wanting more, but maybe the author's approach was different. He tried to compensate by having a dinner and thoughtful gifts.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have known the GF's specific expectations. Maybe he should have asked what she wanted instead of assuming. But he did go all out, so maybe he thought he covered it. The GF's reaction seems harsh, especially calling him manipulative for being sad. That's a strong accusation and might indicate a deeper issue in their communication.\n\nAlso, the fact that the GF took an Uber home and the author left for the airport without resolving it suggests a breakdown in addressing the problem. But the author's response to being defensive and then leaving might not be ideal. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on intentions. He spent a lot, tried to make up for missing the day, but maybe missed the mark on what the GF wanted.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily wrong for spending a significant amount and trying to make it up. The GF's expectations might be unrealistic, especially considering the income is $85k, which is a middle-class salary in many places, so $1k is a substantial portion. However, the GF's feelings are valid, and the author could have done better to understand her preferences. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he made efforts, but the GF was still disappointed, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
