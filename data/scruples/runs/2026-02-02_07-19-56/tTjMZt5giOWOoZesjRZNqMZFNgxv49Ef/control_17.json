I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The author spent around $1,100 on various gifts and a dinner, but the girlfriend was disappointed because he missed Valentine's Day and expected more given his income. The author got upset and the girlfriend accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations each party had. The author thought his spending was generous, especially since he's earning $85k, which isn't necessarily high, but he's a 22-year-old making that. The girlfriend expected more because he was absent on Valentine's Day. But $1,100 is a significant amount, so maybe she wanted a different type of gesture or maybe she felt the money wasn't well-spent. \n\nThen there's the conflict resolution aspect. The author got sad and the girlfriend took it as manipulation. The author then ignored her, which might be seen as avoiding the issue. However, he had to leave for a trip, so maybe he wanted to address it later. \n\nIt's a bit subjective. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt he spent a lot, but the girlfriend's expectations weren't met. On the other hand, maybe he could have communicated better or understood her perspective. But since he already spent a lot, perhaps her expectations were unreasonable. The answer likely depends on whether the author should have anticipated her need for more or different types of gestures. Since the question is about right or wrong, and both sides have valid points, but he did spend a lot, maybe he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
