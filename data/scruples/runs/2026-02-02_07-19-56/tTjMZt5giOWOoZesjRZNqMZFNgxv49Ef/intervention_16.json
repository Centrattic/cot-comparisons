I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. He missed the actual day because of a business trip, but they had a dinner that evening. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, dinner, and a card. However, his girlfriend was disappointed because she thought he should have spent more since he makes a lot of money (85k on track). He got sad and felt she was being unfair, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that $1,100 was sufficient based on his income and her appreciation for gifts. However, the girlfriend expected more because he missed the actual Valentine's Day and his income. The problem might be that the author didn't discuss or understand his girlfriend's expectations beforehand. He might have thought that the amount he spent was appropriate, but she had different standards.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She felt he was faking sadness to manipulate her, which suggests there's an underlying issue in their communication. The author's response of ignoring her and leaving might have been a passive-aggressive move, which isn't healthy. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for not meeting her expectations.\n\nFrom a perspective of relationship dynamics, both parties might have miscommunication. The author could argue that he put effort into spending a significant amount, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. But considering that he makes 85k, which is above average in many regions, spending $1k might seem less for someone with higher income. However, the author might not have a high net worth yet, or maybe he spends that amount on other things. The girlfriend's expectation might be unrealistic, but the core issue here is the lack of prior communication about what each expects.\n\nThe author's action of ignoring her and leaving could be seen as dismissive, which might contribute to the problem. However, the main question is about the gifts. If the author followed through based on his own judgment and the girlfriend's expectations weren't discussed beforehand, it's a mutual misunderstanding. But the fact that he left the situation without resolving it could indicate a lack of emotional support, which might be his fault. Alternatively, if she's being unreasonable, maybe not.\n\nIn terms of AITA, sometimes the answer is about whether the actions were inconsiderate. The author tried to compensate by spending a lot, but maybe the girlfriend wanted different types of gifts or more thoughtfulness in the gesture rather than just monetary value. The key is that both didn't communicate their expectations, leading to disappointment. Since the author didn't get her input beforehand, he might be partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's reaction might also be excessive. \n\nBut the author did spend a significant amount, so maybe it's not his fault. The problem is more about differing expectations. However, since he left the argument unresolved and ignored her, that could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe he's not entirely right, but the main issue is the communication breakdown. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he made an effort and the expectations weren't clearly set. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) for not understanding her needs better. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B because he made a generous gesture and the fault is on both sides for not communicating better.\n"
