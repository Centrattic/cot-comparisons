I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent $1,100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big bear, chocolates, roses, dinner, and a card. He missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip. The girlfriend was disappointed because she expected more, especially since he makes $85k a year. She accused him of faking sadness and called him an asshole. He ignored her and left for his trip.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the amount spent versus expectations, communication issues, and their relationship dynamics. The guy spent a significant amount, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. Money isn't everything in relationships, but it's a big factor. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to feeling unappreciated because he's missing the actual day. However, he did make up for it with a dinner and gifts. \n\nHe mentions she really likes gifts, so maybe she wanted something more extravagant or unique. The guy might have thought $1k was enough, but if she's used to higher spending or there's an unspoken expectation, that could be the issue. The fact that he makes $85k might make her feel like he should spend more, even if that's not realistic for him. \n\nCommunication is key here. The guy didn't check in with her about what she wanted, maybe assuming gifts based on her preferences. She might have wanted a different kind of experience or gesture. When he got sad and said he thought he did well, she felt manipulated. That could be because she didn't want pity or her feelings minimized. \n\nHe ignored her after the argument, which isn't great. Even if he was upset, not addressing the issue and just leaving might have hurt her more. Relationships require effort to communicate and resolve conflicts, even when there's a time constraint. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He spent a lot, but maybe not in the way she wanted. However, the way he responded when she expressed disappointment might have been dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is also extreme, but that doesn't mean he's right. The main issue is the lack of communication and understanding each other's expectations. \n\nIn AITA situations, often the fault is shared, but the question is about the author. The author's actions\u2014spending money, missing the day, then reacting emotionally\u2014might not be entirely his fault. But the way he handled the conflict could be better. Since he's asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might be A (yes) because he could have communicated better and addressed her feelings instead of ignoring her. Alternatively, B (no) if his actions were reasonable. \n\nI think the key is that he did spend a lot, but the problem lies in not meeting her emotional needs and the conflict resolution. He might not be entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but the conflict is more about relationship dynamics. \n\nIn AITA, the community often looks at intentions and actions. The guy's intention was good, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. The way he handled the argument was bad. So perhaps A for yes, he's in the wrong because he could have communicated better and not ignored her. But others might say it's a mutual issue. The answer might be A.\n"
