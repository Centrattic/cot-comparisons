I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author, a 22-year-old male, spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend for her birthday dinner and a bunch of gifts. However, he's going on a business trip and will miss actual Valentine's Day. The GF was disappointed and felt he should have spent more because he makes a decent income ($85k). The author is hurt and defensive, thinking he did enough, but the GF is upset. The author ended up being upset and the GF accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her.\n\nSo, the main points here are about expectations in relationships. The author might have thought the gifts were sufficient, but the GF felt they weren't enough, especially since he's missing V Day. The key question is whether the author is wrong for not meeting her expectations.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have thought the gifts were appropriate, but if the GF had different expectations, maybe he should have discussed it beforehand. However, spending over a thousand dollars is significant, even if the GF wanted more. The GF might be used to higher spending, but the author's income is $85k, which is decent but not a million dollars. The GF's reaction could be seen as unreasonable, expecting more than what he can comfortably spend, especially since they've been together a year. \n\nBut the author's response\u2014getting sad, ignoring her, and leaving without resolving the issue\u2014could be seen as dismissive. The GF might feel unheard, and the author's defense (\"I just spent over a grand\") might not address her emotional needs. The author's reaction of being defensive and then leaving might be in the wrong because he didn't address her feelings directly. However, the GF's expectation of more could also be problematic if it's unrealistic given the author's income and the relationship's duration.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he did put in effort and money, but he could have communicated better. On the other hand, the GF's expectations might be too high, but her reaction is also valid in that she felt unappreciated. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that he made an effort but the GF still felt unmet, the answer could hinge on whether the author should have done more. However, the author's response to her feelings (defensiveness) might be where he's in the wrong. So maybe answer A for Yes, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, the answer could be B if the author isn't in the wrong because he gave a lot and the GF's expectations are unreasonable. Hmm.\n"
