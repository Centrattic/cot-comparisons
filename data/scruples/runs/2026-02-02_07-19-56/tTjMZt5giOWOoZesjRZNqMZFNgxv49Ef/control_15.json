I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy, who's 22 and making around $85k, spent $1,100 on his girlfriend. He got her a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. But his GF was disappointed because he was missing V-Day on a business trip and expected more since he makes a good income. He felt hurt and thought he did well, but she accused him of faking sadness and being an asshole.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both perspectives. From the guy's side, he spent a significant amount of money, which is actually more than his annual income might be. Since he's 22, maybe he's just starting his career, so $85k might not be as high as it sounds in terms of take-home pay after taxes and other expenses. He tried to make up for missing the day with a nice dinner and gifts. But his GF expected even more because he was away and she thought his salary allowed for more spending.\n\nThe GF's reaction is important here. She felt disappointed and thought he should have spent more. But the guy was actually spending a lot, maybe even too much for his budget. The key points are communication and expectations. Did they discuss their expectations before? If the GF had told him that she wanted more or had specific desires, he might have adjusted. But he went all out based on her liking gifts, and she still wasn't satisfied. \n\nAlso, the GF's response seems a bit harsh. She accused him of manipulating her by faking sadness, which could be seen as an attack on his emotions. He was trying to make up for missing the day, and her reaction might have been dismissive of his effort. \n\nAnother angle is the cultural aspect of Valentine's Day. Some people place a lot of importance on spending and gestures on this day. If the GF values grand gestures and the guy was away, maybe the missing the actual day was a bigger issue for her. But he tried to compensate with the dinner as a replacement. \n\nI think the main issue here is mismatched expectations. The guy did his best based on his understanding, but the GF had higher expectations. However, considering that he spent over $1,000, which is a considerable amount, especially for a young person, it's possible he was in the right. The GF's reaction might be unreasonable, especially if she didn't communicate her needs clearly. On the other hand, he could have checked in with her to see if she felt adequately celebrated despite his absence. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He put in the effort and spent a lot, but perhaps didn't consider that absence might affect her more. However, her response was harsh and accusatory. In terms of the situation, the wrong might be on the GF's side for not appreciating his effort and responding negatively, but it's a complex issue. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because he did spend a lot and tried to make up for missing the day, while her reaction was unkind.\n"
