I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent over $1,100, which seems a lot. But his girlfriend was disappointed because he was traveling and missed the actual day, and she thinks he should have spent more given his income. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The guy put a lot of effort and money into the gifts, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant. He even mentions paying for the dinner. The total cost was around $1,100, which is a significant amount. He's 22 and making $85k, which might be considered a good income for his age, but he's spending a large portion on gifts.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt disappointed because he wasn't there on Valentine's Day and thought he should have spent more. She interprets his sadness as manipulation, which adds to the tension. The guy felt hurt and withdrew, going to the airport without resolving the issue. \n\nNow, the key points here: Is it the guy's fault for not meeting her expectations? Maybe the problem is about communication. Did he not understand her needs? Or is she unreasonable in her expectations? The girlfriend might feel that missing the actual day was a big deal and expected more because of that. However, the guy might believe that $1,100 is substantial, even if it's not his entire income. \n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's reaction. She accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. That's a strong accusation and might have contributed to the conflict. The guy's response was to shut down and leave, which isn't ideal for resolving the issue. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the issue is about expectations not being met, it's possible that both sides have some responsibility. However, the user is asking specifically if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The guy did spend a lot, but maybe not in the way she wanted. Gifts are also about thoughtfulness. If she wanted more personalized or different gifts, he might not have known. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned his income and expected him to spend more could be seen as pressuring him, which isn't fair. But the guy's reaction of getting sad and then ignoring her for the night isn't healthy either. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) logic, the community often looks for whether someone was intentionally wrong or if there's a misunderstanding. Here, it's more of a miscommunication. The guy might not be in the wrong because he tried to compensate for missing the day and spent a lot, but he might not have met her specific expectations. However, she might not have communicated her needs clearly. \n\nThe girlfriend's accusation of manipulation is a strong stance, which could indicate her feelings were hurt. The guy's response of ignoring her isn't great conflict resolution, but it's not necessarily a deal-breaker. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he made an effort and spent a considerable amount. However, there's room for both to improve communication. But in AITA terms, unless he did something clearly wrong, he's not the asshole. The girlfriend's expectations might be unreasonable, but that doesn't make him right. Still, the line is thin here. The key is that he tried to make up for missing the day and spent a lot, so maybe he's not at fault.\n"
