I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the guy is asking if he's in the wrong for not buying his girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. He's going on a business trip and missed the actual day. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. She was disappointed because he wasn't there on V-Day and he makes a decent salary. They had a fight, and now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the gifts. $1,100 is a significant amount, but maybe she expected more since he wasn't there. But $85k a year isn't that high, especially if he's 22. Maybe she feels that since he's not there, he should compensate more. But he's already spent a lot, so is it unreasonable for her to expect more? Also, their relationship is a year old. Maybe their expectations differ. He thought the gifts were enough, and she felt they weren't. \n\nCommunication is key here. He didn't realize she wanted more, but she didn't express her expectations clearly. However, he did ask her what was wrong, and she mentioned it then. The problem might be her reaction\u2014calling him manipulative for being sad. That could be harsh. Also, he tried to make it up by having a dinner. \n\nI think the main issue is whether his spending was adequate. If he already spent over a thousand, maybe she's being unreasonable. But maybe she felt that missing the day required more effort. It's a bit of a gray area. The guy's not in the wrong if he genuinely tried and spent a lot. However, if the girlfriend's expectations were different and he didn't meet them, there's some fault on both sides. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he did spend a lot and tried to compensate, maybe he's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
