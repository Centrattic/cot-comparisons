I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts.\n\nThe guy is 22, his girlfriend is 20, they've been together a year. He's going on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day. They had dinner the same day as his trip. He bought a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and paid for an expensive dinner. Total cost around $1,100. He thought that was generous, but she was disappointed because he wasn't there on V-Day and said he should have spent more given his income (he's making $85k). He got sad, she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her, and they ended up not talking. He's now wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy spent a lot, especially for someone making $85k, which might not be as high as some people but for a 22-year-old, it's significant. He tried to make up for missing V-Day with a dinner and gifts. However, she felt he didn't spend enough, maybe because he wasn't there on the actual day. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Did he communicate what he was doing? He did spend a lot, but maybe she was expecting different types of gifts or wanted him to be present? He wasn't there on V-Day itself, which might have been a big issue for her. \n\nHe got emotional and she accused him of faking it. That's a sensitive situation. Maybe their expectations didn't align. The guy thought his spending covered for his absence, but she valued his presence more. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he did try to compensate with gifts, which is understandable. But maybe he should have discussed her expectations beforehand. However, it's also the girlfriend's responsibility to communicate what she wants. She might have expected him to be there, which he couldn't do. \n\nThe argument about his income: she said he makes a lot, but $85k isn't necessarily a huge salary for everyone. Maybe she felt that with his income, he could afford more extravagant gifts. But the guy spent over a thousand, which is a significant portion of his income. \n\nHe didn't get angry but got sad, which she interpreted as manipulation. That's a problem in their communication. Maybe he should have explained his perspective better. However, the initial act of buying the gifts wasn't wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that he was missing V-Day, which she valued, and she felt the gifts weren't enough. He might not be in the wrong because he tried to make up for it, but perhaps failed to meet her emotional needs. However, the way he responded (getting sad and then ignoring her) might have been hurtful. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's at fault. The AITA format usually looks at if the person's actions were wrong. He didn't do anything illegal or unethical. The problem is more about differing expectations. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have anticipated her need for his presence and not just gifts. \n\nAlternatively, since he made an effort and she still felt disappointed, he's not entirely at fault. However, if he had known she wanted him to be there, he might have arranged differently. But since he was on a business trip, maybe it wasn't his choice. \n\nSo considering all, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. The key is that he tried to make it up with gifts, but she wanted more presence. It's a communication issue rather than his being wrong. So B.\n"
