I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the described situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who spent $1,100 on Valentine's Day gifts for his girlfriend but she was disappointed because he was traveling and missed the actual day. She expected more spending since he makes $85k a year.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy spent a significant amount, which is a large portion of his annual income. However, the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, especially since he wasn't there on Valentine's Day. He tried to make up for it with a nice dinner and the gifts. She accused him of manipulating her by faking sadness, which might indicate some issues in communication or expectations.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, expectations can vary. Some people place a high value on grand gestures, while others might prioritize presence or other forms of affection. The guy's approach was to spend money, but the absence on the actual day might have been a bigger issue for her. However, the amount he spent seems generous, especially considering his income. The key here is whether he was wrong in his actions or if the issue is more about differing expectations.\n\nHe might be in the wrong if he didn't consider her feelings about missing the day entirely, not just the gifts. But he did make an effort to compensate. On the other hand, her reaction could be seen as unreasonable given the effort and cost involved. However, the problem might stem from unmet expectations rather than a clear right or wrong action. It's possible that both parties have valid points but need to communicate better. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not meeting her expectations despite his efforts. Since the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I have to decide based on typical AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards. Usually, if both parties have valid perspectives, it's a \"No AITA,\" meaning neither is entirely wrong. But in this case, the girl's disappointment leads to conflict. The man's reaction of being sad and then ignoring her could be seen as dismissive, but he's also under pressure from the trip. I think the core issue is mismatched expectations, so the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he made a significant effort and spent a lot, but the answer could also be A if the expectations were clearly communicated beforehand. However, since he didn't get the memo, and the amount is substantial, leaning towards B.\n"
