I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author, a 22-year-old guy, is on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day. They had dinner to make up for it. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. The girlfriend was disappointed, expecting more because he was missing the actual day and he makes $85k a year. The author felt it was a lot, especially since his salary isn't that high yet. The girlfriend accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her, and they ended up separating for the night.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, expectations can vary. The girlfriend might have had higher hopes, thinking that missing the day required more gestures. The author's spending was significant, but maybe the girlfriend values different things or wanted more effort in the form of time or specific gifts. The argument about his income is a point\u2014$85k is a good salary for someone in their 20s, but if he's not making that yet, the expenditure might feel like a stretch. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. The author did put in a lot of effort and money. The accusation of manipulation is a strong one, which might have escalated the conflict. The key here is communication. Maybe they didn't discuss expectations beforehand. The author might not be in the wrong because he made an effort, but there's room for both sides. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the effort and the girlfriend's reaction, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's disappointment was justified based on prior expectations, maybe A. But given the details, the author's actions seem reasonable, so B.\n"
