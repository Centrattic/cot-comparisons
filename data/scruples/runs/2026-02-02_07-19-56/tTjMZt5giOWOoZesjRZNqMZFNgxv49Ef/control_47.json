I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not buying his girlfriend more gifts for Valentine's Day. He missed the actual day because of a business trip but had a dinner the night before. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. His girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on Valentine's Day and thought he should have spent more since he makes $85k a year. He got sad when she said that, and she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in their relationship. He was gone for the actual Valentine's Day, so maybe she expected some gestures specifically on that day. But he tried to make up for it with the dinner the night before. The gifts he got were expensive, but maybe she wanted something else. Maybe she wanted to celebrate the day itself, not a day before. So he might have missed the timing, which could be a point.\n\nHe spent over $1k, which is a lot, but she might have different expectations. However, his income is $85k, so from her perspective, he could afford more. But he also says he already spent over a grand, which is a significant portion of his annual income. So maybe he's not in the wrong for not spending more because he already put in a substantial amount. But then again, maybe he should have considered her feelings about missing the actual day. \n\nThe way he responded when she expressed disappointment also matters. He got sad and maybe defensive, which could have hurt her feelings. She felt he was manipulating her emotions. That part might be where he's in the wrong, not the spending. He could have handled the conversation better instead of getting defensive.\n\nSo the main issues are: timing of the gifts (before vs. actual day), the amount spent relative to her expectations, and the emotional response. If the problem is about the timing, maybe he's not in the wrong because he tried to compensate. But if the issue is about not considering her emotional needs enough, then he might be at fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for the spending, not necessarily the emotional response. Since he did spend a lot, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that missing the actual day was a mistake, regardless of the spending. \n\nI think the key is whether the amount and gestures were appropriate. $1k is a lot, but maybe she wanted specific things he didn't get. However, the problem might be more about communication. He thought he did enough, she didn't. It's a common issue in relationships where expectations differ. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he made an effort and spent a lot, but the situation is a bit of a gray area. However, if the problem is about missing the actual day, maybe there's some fault. But the question is specifically about not buying enough, not missing the day. So if he spent over a grand, maybe he's not wrong. Alternatively, if her expectation was higher due to his income, but $85k isn't that high. Depending on their location, $1k could be reasonable. So I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
