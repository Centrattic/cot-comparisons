I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The author is a guy who spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner, and a card. He missed V-Day because he's on a business trip, so they had dinner the previous night. His girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and thought he should have spent more given his income.\n\nHmm, the guy argues that he spent a lot already and that he doesn't make that much (he's on track for $85k). The girlfriend thinks he should have done more, maybe because he wasn't there. Is he in the wrong?\n\nFirst, the amount he spent is significant. $1k is a lot, especially for someone making $85k a year. But maybe the girlfriend expected more since he wasn't there on the actual day. But is expecting more unreasonable? Maybe. Also, he says he thought his gifts were good because she likes receiving gifts. However, the key point is that he was absent for the actual day. Maybe she wanted more gestures that coincided with the day itself, like a special delivery or something else.\n\nThen there's the part where he says he got sad and told her he thought he did well, and she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. That's a sensitive issue. If he was genuinely trying to express his feelings and she accused him of manipulation, maybe there's a communication problem here. The author didn't respond well to her disappointment, leading to an argument.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he spent a lot, but maybe he didn't consider that her disappointment wasn't about the amount but the missed presence. Maybe he should have communicated better or tried to do something during the trip, like a special message or a gift that arrives on V-Day. Alternatively, maybe she's being unreasonable because the amount he spent was already substantial. But relationships involve compromise and expectations. If he thought his gestures were enough but she felt it wasn't, perhaps he should have checked in with her earlier or found a way to make her feel acknowledged despite being away. His response to her disappointment by getting sad and then ignoring her might have been harsh. The fact that he left without resolving the issue might be a problem.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, he put a lot into gifts. On the other, he missed the actual day and didn't account for her feelings about his absence. Also, the way he reacted to her disappointment could be seen as dismissive. Maybe he should have been more empathetic and tried to understand her perspective instead of defending his actions. The girlfriend's reaction is also intense, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's right. So, maybe the author did something wrong by not addressing her feelings better, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: if the girlfriend's expectations were unreasonable given the circumstances, then maybe he's not. But given the communication breakdown, maybe he is.\n"
