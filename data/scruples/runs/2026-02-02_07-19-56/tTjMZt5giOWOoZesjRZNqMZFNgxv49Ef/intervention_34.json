I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding Valentine's Day gifts. The main points are: they spent $1,100 on various gifts, but their girlfriend was disappointed because he missed the actual day and expected more. He thought the spending was enough, but she felt he should have spent more given his income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy argues he spent a significant amount, which is about 1/8th of his annual income. That's a lot, but maybe she wanted more. However, he was on a business trip and made up for it with a dinner. But she felt he should have done more because he was missing V-Day. \n\nNow, relationships involve expectations, and sometimes they differ. The key question is whether the amount he spent was reasonable. $1,100 is a lot, but maybe she felt that since he was missing the actual day, the gestures needed to be more elaborate. On the other hand, he might feel that the spending was sufficient, especially considering it's a significant portion of his income. \n\nAnother angle: communication. They didn't discuss what each expected beforehand. He assumed gifts were enough, she might have wanted something else. Also, his reaction\u2014getting sad and then ignoring her\u2014could be seen as dismissive. Maybe he should have tried to understand her feelings more instead of just leaving it for later. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be harsh, but her disappointment is valid if she felt unvalued. However, the author's spending was substantial. The problem might be more about differing expectations rather than the author being outright wrong. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he met his own expectations but not hers, it's more about communication than being wrong. But if he knew she valued presence more, then maybe he should have adjusted. However, he did make an effort and spent a lot. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his actions were generous, but maybe A if the issue is about not meeting her expectations. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Being in the wrong usually implies a moral failing. Since he tried and spent a lot, maybe he's not in the wrong. The problem is mutual misunderstanding. So I think the answer is B.\n"
