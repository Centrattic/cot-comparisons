I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who didn't buy his girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day because he was on a business trip. He spent over $1,100 on various gifts and a dinner, but she was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and thought he should have spent more given his income. The guy feels he did enough, but the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the guy is at fault. The key points here are expectations around gift-giving, communication, and the context of their relationship. The guy put a lot of money into gifts, but the girlfriend expected more because he wasn't physically present and their income level. \n\nThe question is whether the guy's actions were wrong. The guy's defense is that he spent a significant amount, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. In relationships, expectations can vary a lot. If the guy had previously communicated his plan and she was okay with it, maybe it's different. But since he was on a trip, maybe he should have discussed what she wanted before. However, he did make an effort to compensate with a dinner and gifts the night before. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction includes accusing him of manipulating her emotions by faking sadness. That might indicate she's upset not just about the gifts but also about the emotional response. The guy felt he did enough, but the girlfriend had different expectations. \n\nIn terms of who's wrong, it's possible that the guy didn't consider that her disappointment wasn't about the amount spent but about the absence on the actual day. Maybe she wanted a different kind of gesture or communication. But the guy tried to make up with material gifts. However, in some perspectives, the value of the gifts is subjective; just because he spent $1k doesn't mean it's enough. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the guy should have communicated better or considered non-material gestures. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the guy had a good faith effort and the girlfriend is overreacting, he's not wrong. If he should have done more despite his spending, then he is. \n\nGiven that he was on a business trip and couldn't be there, he tried to make up for it. The girlfriend's expectations were based on his income, but he might not have known she wanted more. So maybe the guy isn't in the wrong. Answer B (No).\n"
