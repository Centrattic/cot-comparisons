I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The author, a guy in a year-long relationship, spent around $1100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive place, and a card. He missed being with her on V Day due to a business trip. They had dinner to compensate. The GF felt he should have spent more because he's making $85k and he's away, so she expected more. The author was surprised and felt sad, then his GF accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. He left, and she took an Uber home.\n\nFirst, the key points here are expectations around gift-giving and the emotional response. The author argues he spent a lot, but the GF felt it wasn't enough. Now, whether he's in the wrong depends on cultural norms, relationship dynamics, and communication.\n\nIn many relationships, gift-giving is a personal thing. What's considered generous can vary. $1100 is a significant amount, but maybe she expected even more because he's away, which is common in some cultures. However, the author's salary is $85k; while that's a decent income, it's not a huge amount. Spending $1100 is a lot for him. \n\nThe GF's reaction is problematic. She seems to think his spending wasn't enough, and she accused him of faking sadness. That's a serious accusation and can be manipulative. The author felt ignored and left, which isn't healthy. But the question is if he's in the wrong for not giving more or for his reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the GF's expectations are unrealistic. The author tried to make up by having a dinner, so maybe she felt the effort wasn't enough. However, the way she reacted by calling him manipulative and being annoyed might be more the issue. The author's response of being sad and then ignoring her isn't ideal, but the main conflict is about unmet expectations.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at both sides. The author did spend a lot, but the GF's feelings are valid if that's what she expected. However, the GF's accusation of manipulation is harsh. The author might not be in the wrong for not meeting her expectations if they weren't clearly communicated. Alternatively, if the GF had communicated her expectations earlier, maybe the author could have adjusted. But he did spend a lot, so maybe she's being unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The GF's reaction is more concerning, especially calling him manipulative without evidence. The answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The user initially thought the author was wrong, but maybe the GF is more to blame here. The author's actions were reasonable, and the GF's response was harsh. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
