I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 20, they've been together over a year. He's going on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day, so they had a dinner that evening as a make-up. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. The GF was disappointed because he was missing the actual day and he makes a lot of money (85k). She thinks he should have spent more. The guy felt he did enough, got sad, and there was some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the guy's actions were unreasonable. He spent a significant amount, almost his annual income (since he's making 85k and spent 1.1k, which is about 1.3% of his income, but maybe 10k would be better if he makes 85k? Wait, 1.1k is about 1.3% of 85k. That's not that high, but maybe in terms of gift expenses, it's a lot. But he's 22, maybe he's a recent grad, so having 85k is good for his age. However, spending $1k on gifts might be seen as a lot. But the GF expected more because he was missing the actual day. \n\nThe GF's reaction: she expected more, was disappointed, called him an asshole for faking sadness. The guy felt he did enough and got defensive. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom the guy's perspective, he spent a lot, maybe more than he should, but he felt it was sufficient. The GF might have different expectations. In relationships, expectations can vary. The guy's GF might value gestures more than the actual amount, especially missing the actual Valentine's Day. \n\nIs the guy wrong for not meeting her expectations? Well, he made an effort, but maybe didn't consider her feelings about missing the actual day. However, he was also trying to compensate by having dinner that evening. The GF might feel that missing the actual day requires more elaborate gifts. \n\nBut the guy's argument is that he spent over a thousand, which is a lot, and he's not making that much. Maybe he's right in thinking that's a lot, but maybe he's wrong if the GF felt it wasn't enough. However, the GF took an Uber home, which could be a sign of tension, but maybe that's her choice. \n\nThe guy's response of getting sad and feeling manipulated might have been a poor reaction. But the core issue is whether his spending was insufficient. The GF's disappointment could be about the timing of the gifts (celebrating after the fact) rather than the amount. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often considers both parties' perspectives. If the GF expected more because he was missing the day, maybe the guy didn't fully consider her feelings about the timing. However, he did spend a significant amount. \n\nBut the GF's claim that he makes a lot (85k) and should spend more could be a point. But 85k isn't that high for a 22-year-old, maybe in some areas, but it's a decent salary. However, $1k is a significant chunk for a gift. Maybe the GF's expectations were unreasonable. \n\nAlternatively, the guy might have been wrong in not understanding her desire for more, but the GF might have been wrong in being upset about not getting enough when he already spent so much. \n\nI think the key is whether the guy's actions were sufficient based on mutual understanding. If they had different expectations about what's appropriate when missing the actual day, then both might have some fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe GF's reaction of calling him an asshole for faking sadness seems harsh. The guy's response of ignoring her and leaving might not be the best, but if he was upset, maybe that's understandable. However, the core issue is the gift amount. \n\nIn many AITA cases, if one person's actions are reasonable but the other has unreasonable expectations, the person with the unreasonable expectations is in the wrong. Here, the guy did spend a lot, but maybe the GF expected even more. However, the guy's salary is 85k, so spending 1k is about 1.3% of his income, which is a decent amount. \n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, celebrating a one-year anniversary and missing the actual V-Day might require more effort. But the guy did spend a lot. \n\nI think the answer depends on if spending 1k was sufficient. If the GF felt it wasn't enough despite the amount, maybe she's in the wrong. But the guy might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings about the timing. \n\nBut since the question is about the author's wrongness, and the author made a significant effort, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, his reaction of getting sad and implying manipulation might be seen as manipulative. \n\nHmm. The community often goes with the person who had unreasonable expectations. So if the guy did a lot and the GF still is upset, maybe she's in the wrong. So answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
