I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy is M22, GF F20, been together over a year. He's going on a business trip and missed V-Day, so they had dinner. He spent about $1100 on various gifts: Tiffany bracelet, big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner. She was disappointed because he missed actual V-Day and since he makes a lot (85k), she expected more. He felt he spent a lot, but she was annoyed, accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. He left, she took an Uber, and they'll talk later.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. I need to decide A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the guy spent a significant amount, but she expected more because he was away. But $1100 is a lot, especially for a year-long relationship. Maybe her expectations were unrealistic? Or maybe he didn't consider her feelings about not being there on the actual day. \n\nHe thought he did well, but she felt it wasn't enough. The key points: He made up for it with dinner and gifts, but she wanted something else. Maybe he should have communicated better or anticipated her need for a gesture on the actual day. However, he did compensate with a big dinner and expensive gifts. The argument about his income\u201485k isn't that high, maybe she felt he could spend more. \n\nThe guy's reaction: getting sad, which she called manipulative. That might not have been the best approach. But he was hurt. The girl seemed unreasonable in her expectations. The guy's actions: ignoring her and leaving, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The guy might be wrong in not understanding her need for something specific on V-Day despite spending a lot. But she might be wrong in expecting more when he had to be away. The guy's spending was generous, but maybe missed the emotional aspect of the day. \n\nAlternatively, she's being unfair with the amount he spent given their relationship length. The answer depends on whether expectations were realistic. But the author is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA situations, sometimes the person's actions are judged. He tried to make it up, but she wasn't satisfied. Maybe he's not in the wrong because he spent a lot, but maybe he is because he didn't consider her feelings about the actual day. The argument about manipulation is tricky. If he was genuinely upset, but she accused him of faking, that's a conflict. \n\nOverall, the author might not be in the wrong. He tried to compensate, but she had higher expectations. So answer B.\n"
