I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent $1,100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner. But she was disappointed because he was away on a business trip and thought he should have spent more since he earns $85k a year. He felt he did a good job, but she was annoyed, even accusing him of faking sadness to manipulate her. Now they're separated for the week, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The main issue is whether the guy did enough. He spent a significant amount, which is over a thousand dollars. That's a lot, especially considering his income is around 85k, so it's a notable chunk. However, the girlfriend expected more, possibly because he was missing Valentine's Day entirely and she might have attached more importance to the actual day. \n\nBut is the guy in the wrong? Well, he did make an effort by arranging a dinner to make up for missing the day. The gifts he provided were thoughtful and expensive. The fact that she was still disappointed might stem from her own expectations, possibly influenced by his income. However, it's also possible that her expectations were unreasonable, given that the cost of the gifts already exceeded his annual spending. \n\nAnother angle is the communication breakdown. He might not have realized her expectations were higher, and she might not have communicated what she wanted. The accusation of \"faking\" sadness seems harsh, but maybe she felt he was trying to elicit sympathy. However, the guy's reaction of being hurt and not knowing how to address her disappointment might be valid. \n\nIt's important to consider cultural norms around Valentine's Day. Some people place a lot of importance on the actual day, while others focus on the effort. The fact that he made an effort on the day before and arranged a dinner shows he tried. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as entitled if she expected more without considering the financial constraints. \n\nOn the other hand, if she felt that because he earns a decent income, he should spend more, there's a valid point there. But spending over $1,000 is already a lot, and maybe she wanted specific gifts he didn't get. However, the user didn't mention if there were specific things she wanted. If he didn't know, it's not entirely his fault. \n\nThe argument could be that the girlfriend is in the wrong for not appreciating the effort and for making him feel bad about his spending. But the guy might also be in the wrong if he failed to check in with her about her expectations. However, the situation is complex. \n\nIn terms of the AITA format, usually, people are in the wrong if they acted with intent to harm or were unreasonable. Here, the guy did his best given the circumstances, and the girlfriend's reaction might be disproportionate. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have spent more, hence A. However, spending $1k is substantial, so it's likely B.\n"
