I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not buying his girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation is that he missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip and spent $1,100 on a dinner, a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, etc. However, his girlfriend was disappointed and thought he should have spent more, especially since he's making $85k a year. The author felt he did enough, got upset when she was disappointed, and the conversation ended poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author spent a significant amount, which is almost his annual income (since he's making $85k and the trip is a week long). He tried to make up for missing V Day with a dinner and gifts. On the other hand, the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, perhaps because she had different expectations or felt he could have done more given his income. The argument escalated when he expressed sadness, and she accused him of manipulating her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are expectations in relationships and communication. The author might have thought his gestures were sufficient, but the girlfriend had different expectations. However, spending $1k is substantial, and the author's reaction (getting sad and then ignoring her) might not have been the best approach. But was he in the wrong for not meeting her expectations?\n\nIn relationships, both partners have different needs and expectations. If the author thought he was being generous, but the girlfriend still felt unmet, maybe there's a communication issue. The author's reaction (getting upset and then ignoring her) could be seen as dismissive, but does that mean he's in the wrong? Or is the girlfriend in the wrong for expecting more given the actual spending?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comment about his income might have come off as dismissive of the amount spent. The author spent almost 1/80th of his annual income on gifts, which is a lot for a single day. However, if the girlfriend expected more, maybe she should have communicated that better beforehand. The author might not be in the wrong for not anticipating higher spending if it wasn't discussed.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, relationships often involve compromise and understanding. The author did his part, but maybe didn't fully understand her emotional needs. However, he did make an effort with a dinner and gifts. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling her needs weren't met, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. It's possible both have valid points, but in terms of who is in the wrong, maybe neither is entirely at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he made a significant effort and the girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But he could have handled the conversation better.\n"
