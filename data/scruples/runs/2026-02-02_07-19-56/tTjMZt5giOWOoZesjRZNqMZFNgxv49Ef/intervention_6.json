I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts.\n\nSo, the guy spent about $1,100 on his girlfriend. He got her a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, a card, paid for dinner at an expensive restaurant, and missed actual Valentine's Day because he was on a business trip. He tried to make up for it with a dinner that evening. But his girlfriend was disappointed, expecting more since he was missing V Day and makes $85k a year. She thought he should have spent more. The guy got upset, said he thought he did well, and then the conversation got tense. The GF was annoyed, accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her, and they ended up parting ways for the night.\n\nThe guy is asking if he's at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arguments. The guy did spend a significant amount. $1,100 is a lot, especially for a gift. He also went to great lengths with the gifts. However, the GF wanted more, possibly because he was missing the actual day. The fact that he makes $85k might make her think he can spend more, but it's up to personal values how much one spends. \n\nOn the other hand, the GF's reaction seems harsh. The guy put effort into gifting, but she was disappointed. Maybe her expectations were higher because he was missing V Day. But does that justify her being annoyed and calling him manipulative? Also, the guy's response of getting sad and then ignoring her for the rest of the night could have been hurtful. \n\nCommunication is key here. The girl expressed her disappointment, and instead of trying to understand her feelings, the guy got defensive. He might have misread her disappointment as not being appreciative. The GF's accusation of manipulation and her annoyance might have been a reaction to his defensiveness. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The guy did spend a lot, but maybe he didn't meet his GF's expectations. However, the way he responded (getting sad, then ignoring her) might have been dismissive. The GF's reaction was also harsh, but her expectations were not met. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate their needs. If he didn't know she expected more, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But he could have asked for her preferences. However, the GF's reaction of saying he's trying to manipulate her by faking sadness could be an overreaction. \n\nI think the main issue is the communication breakdown. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because he put in effort and spent a lot. But he could have handled the situation better by being more open to her feelings instead of getting defensive. However, the GF's expectations were high without clear communication from her side. \n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether the author should have known better or if the GF was unreasonable. Since the GF explicitly said she wanted more, and the author didn't adjust, maybe he's in the wrong. But the GF's response was also harsh. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks at who's more at fault. If the author spent a lot but didn't meet expectations, and then got defensive, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if the GF's expectations were unreasonable, he's not the one at fault. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider that her disappointment was genuine and not just about the money. Maybe he could have tried to meet her expectations better. But again, without her clearly stating what she wanted, it's a gray area. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He spent a significant amount, tried to make up for missing V Day, and the GF's reaction was harsh. The author might have been defensive, but the main issue is communication. The GF should have expressed her expectations more clearly, and the author might not be at fault here.\n"
