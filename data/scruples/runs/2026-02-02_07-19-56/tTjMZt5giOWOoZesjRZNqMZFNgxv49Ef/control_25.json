I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough Valentine's Day gifts. \n\nFirst, the guy is 22, she's 20, they've been together over a year. He's going on a business trip, so they had dinner instead of celebrating on Valentine's Day. He spent around $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, chocolates, roses, dinner. She was disappointed because he wasn't there for V Day and mentions he should have spent more since he makes $85k. He felt he did enough, got upset, and she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. Now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are expectations and communication. He made a big effort with expensive gifts, but she expected even more. His income is $85k, but he spent over a grand, which is a significant portion of that. Maybe she felt the gifts didn't compensate for missing the actual day? Also, their dynamic might be about what each values. He might think the gifts are enough, while she wanted presence or different gestures. \n\nHe got sad and she accused him of manipulating her. That could be a conflict in emotional responses. Maybe he didn't handle the conversation well, getting defensive, and she felt unheard. But is he in the wrong? If he spent a lot but she still felt unappreciated, maybe he didn't consider her needs beyond material gifts. Or maybe she's being unreasonable given the amount he spent. \n\nIt's a bit subjective. Financially, $1k is a lot for someone making $85k, but maybe she wanted even more. But the fact that he's missing the day might factor into her disappointment. He tried to compensate with gifts, but perhaps she wanted his presence more. The argument could be that he didn't communicate his reasons for missing V Day or ensure her feelings were validated. However, he did make an effort with dinner and gifts. \n\nThe answer could depend on whether the problem is about the gifts not meeting her expectations or about missing the day itself. If missing the day is the main issue, then maybe the gifts weren't enough to make up for it. But he might not be wrong if he believed the gifts were sufficient. The conflict here is about differing expectations. Without more context on their usual relationship dynamics, it's hard to say definitively. But generally, both sides might have valid points, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author's mistake was not understanding that presence matters more than gifts for her, then he's partially wrong. But if he did his best and she's being unreasonable, he's not wrong. The fact that he asked for advice suggests he's trying to reconcile, which is positive. However, his reaction (getting sad and then ignoring her) might have been poor handling. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he could have communicated better and perhaps considered her feelings more than just material gifts. But some might argue B (not wrong) because he made a significant effort. But I think the community often sides with validating emotions over material gestures, so maybe A.\n"
