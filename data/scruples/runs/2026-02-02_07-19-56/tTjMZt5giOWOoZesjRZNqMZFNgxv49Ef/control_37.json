I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend more gifts on Valentine's Day. The author is a 22-year-old male, and his girlfriend is 20, in a relationship for over a year. He was going on a business trip and missed Valentine's Day, so they had a dinner to make up for it. He spent around $1,100 on various gifts like a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, a card, and dinner. She was disappointed because he wasn't there on actual Valentine's Day and expected more since he makes $85k a year. The author was sad, but she accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her, which annoyed her. He ignored her and went to the airport, and she took an Uber home.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The main points here are the value of the gifts, the missed actual Valentine's Day, and the girlfriend's reaction. The author spent a significant amount of money, which is a lot for a one-day event, especially for someone making $85k. But she expected more because he wasn't there on the actual day. Is it reasonable for her to expect more? Relationships can vary, but in a one-year relationship, spending $1k is generous. However, if the girlfriend felt that the gifts weren't enough because he wasn't present, maybe there's an expectation of being together on the actual day. But the author did make up for it with a dinner and the gifts. \n\nHe got emotional and expressed that he was sad, but she saw that as manipulation. Then he ignored her for the rest of the night. That part might be the issue. Even if he was sad, ignoring her and not addressing her feelings could be seen as dismissive. Communication is key in relationships. Instead of getting defensive or ignoring her, he should have listened more and tried to understand her perspective. The argument arises from different expectations about what constitutes proper celebration, especially when missing the day. The author's actions after the argument (ignoring her) might have been inconsiderate. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The gifts were expensive, but maybe the girlfriend wanted more personal or meaningful gestures instead of just material gifts. The author might have misunderstood her needs. Also, making assumptions about her expectations based on his salary could lead to issues. However, the main problem here seems to be the conflict handling. He got defensive, used emotional reactions, and then ignored her, which isn't ideal. So, even if the gifts were sufficient, the way he handled the situation might be where he's in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might also be excessive. $1k is a lot, but she wanted more. Maybe she values presence more than gifts. But the author didn't offer a meaningful apology or try to reconcile. He just left and said they'd talk later. That could be seen as avoiding the issue. So, the author's mistake is in how he responded to her disappointment rather than the act of not buying more gifts. Therefore, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong for the gifts, but maybe in the way he handled the conflict. Wait, the question is specifically about not buying enough gifts. The girlfriend's disappointment is about the missed day and the amount of gifts. The author tried to compensate with the dinner and gifts but she still felt it was insufficient. But he spent a lot, so maybe he's not in the wrong for the gifts. However, the way he reacted (getting defensive, ignoring her) is where he might be in the wrong. The original question is about the gifts, though. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for not buying enough. The answer would hinge on whether the amount was insufficient. Since $1k is a lot, maybe not. But the girlfriend expected more due to missing the day and his income. But the author's salary is $85k, which is a mid-range income, and the spending is a large part of that. So maybe the girlfriend's expectation is unreasonable. The author's actions were wrong in how he handled the conflict (ignoring her, getting defensive), but the initial act of gift-giving? The options are A or B. The question is whether he is in the wrong for not buying enough. If he did buy enough, then B. If he should have done more, then A. But given the amount he spent, it's hard to say that's not enough. However, the girlfriend's perspective is important. If she felt it wasn't enough despite the money, maybe he's not in the wrong for the gifts. So the answer would be B. But the user might also be in the wrong for the way he handled the conflict. The question is about the gifts, though. The answer is B.\n"
