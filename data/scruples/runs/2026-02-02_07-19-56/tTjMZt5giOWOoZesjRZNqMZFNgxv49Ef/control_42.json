I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying enough gifts on Valentine's Day. The situation is that the author is a guy in a one-year relationship, and he spent $1,100 on gifts, including a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and a dinner. He missed V-Day because he's on a business trip. His girlfriend was disappointed, thinking he should have spent more since he's making $85k a year. He got sad and they had a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points here are expectations around gift-giving and communication. The author tried to make up for missing V-Day by spending a significant amount, but the girlfriend still felt it wasn't enough. The question is whether the author's spending was sufficient or if he should have done more.\n\nThe author's defense is that he spent over $1,000, which is a considerable amount, and he's not making that much money. However, the girlfriend's expectation was higher, possibly because he wasn't there on actual V-Day and his income is higher. But is there a standard for what's \"enough\"? Gift-giving can be subjective and depends on individual expectations and the relationship's dynamics.\n\nThe user might be looking for an analysis of whether the author's actions met reasonable expectations. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she had higher expectations, but the author might not have known that. Did he fail to communicate or ask about her preferences? Maybe he assumed his spending was enough based on past experiences or general societal norms. However, in a relationship, understanding each other's expectations is important. If the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, maybe the author should have been more proactive in discussing what she wanted instead of assuming.\n\nAlso, the argument escalated when the author got sad and the girlfriend accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. That could indicate a breakdown in communication. But the core issue is whether the spending was insufficient. The author might not be in the wrong if his spending was genuine and considered generous, but there's a part where he could have better communicated to understand her needs. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be unreasonable if she expected more without prior discussion.\n\nIn some cultures or relationships, spending a lot is a big deal, but others might prioritize presence or personal effort. Since the author was absent, maybe the girlfriend wanted a more elaborate gesture. But was $1,100 not enough? It's subjective. The author's income is $85k, so spending $1k is a significant portion, but it's not entirely unreasonable. However, if the girlfriend felt it was insufficient, that's a point of contention.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author should have known to spend more. If there was no prior indication of her expectations, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he ignored her preferences or didn't communicate, he might share some responsibility. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since he tried to make it up by spending a lot, but she still felt it wasn't enough, it's possible he's not at fault, but there's room for both sides. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he made an effort, but some might argue A if he could have done more. But given the info, B seems more likely.\n"
