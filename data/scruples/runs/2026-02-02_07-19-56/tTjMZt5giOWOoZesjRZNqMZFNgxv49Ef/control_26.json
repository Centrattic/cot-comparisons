I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy is going on a business trip, so he missed V-Day and had a dinner instead. He spent around $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. His girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and mentioned his income. He felt it was a lot, but she felt he should have spent more. Their argument ended with her being annoyed, saying he's manipulating, and they're now separated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's wrong. The key points are expectations vs. actions. He tried to compensate by spending a significant amount, but she expected more. However, his salary is $85k, and $1k is a large chunk. But maybe she expected more given his income? However, he might not make that much yet (on track to make 85k this year, so maybe he hasn't made it yet). Also, the fact that he's missing the actual V-Day might have made her feel less appreciated. \n\nBut from a relationship perspective, communication is key. Did he consult her about what she wanted? If she wanted to be there together but he had to miss it, maybe the gifts were a good effort. However, if she felt the gifts didn't make up for missing the day, maybe he should have done something else. But he went overboard financially. \n\nIs it his fault? He did spend a lot, but maybe she wanted different gestures rather than material things. Also, when he was sad, she accused him of faking it, which might be a communication breakdown. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both sides have responsibility. If he made an effort but she still felt unappreciated, maybe it's not entirely his fault. Alternatively, if he didn't consider her feelings about missing the day, maybe he is. But he did make up for it with dinner and gifts. \n\nThe answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he made a significant effort given the circumstances. However, there's a possibility that he didn't meet her expectations due to not being present. But since he couldn't be there, the gifts were a substitute. So likely, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
