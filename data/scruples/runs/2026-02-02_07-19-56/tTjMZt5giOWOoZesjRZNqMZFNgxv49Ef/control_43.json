I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who spent over $1,000 on Valentine's Day gifts for his girlfriend but she was disappointed because he missed the actual day and they had different expectations. He's M22, she's F20, together for over a year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The guy spent a significant amount, but she wanted more because he wasn't there on the actual day. He's making $85k, so she thinks he should have spent more. He felt he did well but she was annoyed. The guy got upset and didn't talk to her, then left for a trip. She accused him of manipulating by faking sadness.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the guy is wrong. Let's break it down. Communication is a big factor here. Did he know her expectations? If he missed the actual day, maybe she wanted a different kind of celebration or more gestures. But he did spend a lot, and the cost is more than his annual income. That's a lot for a gift. But maybe she values presence over things. He tried to compensate with a dinner and gifts, but she still felt let down. \n\nHe got upset and then ignored her, which could be seen as dismissive. She accused him of faking sadness, which might have been a hurtful reaction. The guy's response might have been defensive. Also, the girl's reaction could be seen as unreasonable if the guy spent so much money. But maybe in their relationship, being together on the day is more important. \n\nIt's about expectations. The guy might not be in the wrong because he tried to make up for it, but he could have communicated better. However, the girl's disappointment is valid if presence was important. The guy's reaction of getting sad and then ignoring her might have worsened the situation. But he's also justified in feeling hurt after spending so much. \n\nThe answer could depend on whether the girl's reaction was overly harsh or if the guy didn't meet her emotional needs despite the gifts. Since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, maybe the author is not in the wrong (B) because he made an effort, but there's a communication issue. Alternatively, if the girl's needs were unmet despite the material gifts, maybe the author should have known better. But the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
