I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. They went on a business trip, which made them miss the actual day. Instead, they had a dinner and gave several gifts totaling around $1,100. The girlfriend was disappointed because the guy was supposed to be missing V-Day and he makes a decent income. The main issue here seems to be the girlfriend's expectation versus the guy's effort.\n\nFirst, the guy spent a significant amount of money on gifts. A Tiffany bracelet, a large stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. That adds up to a lot. But maybe the girlfriend felt that since he was going to be away, he should have spent even more. The guy might not have considered that missing the actual day might require a more extravagant gesture. \n\nHowever, the girl's reaction seems a bit harsh. He spent over $1,000, which is a lot, especially considering his income is $85k. It's hard to see how he could have spent more without being unreasonable. The fact that she took an Uber home and the guy left immediately might indicate some conflict in their relationship. The girlfriend's accusation that he's manipulating her by faking sadness could be a point of tension here. \n\nThe guy's defense is that he thought he did well, but maybe he didn't consider her emotional needs beyond the material gifts. Sometimes, people in relationships have different expectations. If the girlfriend felt that the gifts weren't enough to compensate for missing the day entirely, maybe she should have communicated that better. On the other hand, spending $1,100 on gifts is substantial, and expecting even more might be unrealistic. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's important to consider both sides. The guy made an effort and spent a lot, but maybe the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. The key here is whether the guy's actions were adequate given the circumstances. Since he was on a business trip and had already made a dinner arrangement, the girlfriend's disappointment might stem from unmet expectations rather than the guy's wrongdoing. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. He put in a lot of money and effort, and the girlfriend's reaction seems more about her expectations not being met rather than his failure to meet a reasonable standard. The answer would be B (No).\n"
