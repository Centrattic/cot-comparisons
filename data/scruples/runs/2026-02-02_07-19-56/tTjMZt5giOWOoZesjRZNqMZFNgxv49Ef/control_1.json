I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old male in a relationship with a 20-year-old female for over a year. They had dinner to make up for missing Valentine's Day because he's going on a business trip. He spent $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, a card, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. She felt disappointed because he wasn't there on actual Valentine's Day and mentioned that he could have spent more since he makes $85k a year. He was shocked because he already spent a lot, more than he makes annually. He got sad and said he thought he did well, but she accused him of faking sadness and being an asshole. They ended up separating for the night.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the expectations around gift-giving for Valentine's Day, the fact that he was away on a business trip, and the financial aspect. The author spent a significant amount, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough because he wasn't present on the actual day and because of his income. \n\nFirst, the amount spent: $1,100 is a lot, especially for someone earning $85k a year. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests she expected even more, possibly because he wasn't there on the day itself. The author tried to make up for it with a dinner, which seems like a good gesture, but she wasn't satisfied. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She might feel that being physically present on Valentine's Day is important, and since he's missing it, she expected more extravagant gifts. Her comment about his income could imply she feels he can afford to spend more. But the author points out that he already spent over a thousand, which is a significant portion of his annual income, and he's not making that much. \n\nFrom the author's point of view, he did go all out with gifts and dinner, but she still felt disappointed. He was genuinely surprised and upset when she criticized him. The argument escalated, leading to her accusing him of faking sadness. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he made an effort to compensate by arranging a dinner and buying expensive gifts. Missing the actual day might have been a factor she considered important. However, the amount he spent was considerable, and he might not have known that she expected even more. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a point to consider. She felt disappointed and expressed it by stating he should have spent more, which might not have been the best way to communicate. The author's response of feeling shocked and sad is probably a valid reaction given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both sides have some fault. The author could have checked in with her about what she expected, especially knowing he'd miss the day. On the other hand, she could have communicated her expectations more clearly instead of being disappointed and making a comment about his income. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. If he made a genuine effort and spent a lot, perhaps he's not entirely at fault. However, if the girlfriend had specific expectations that weren't met, maybe he should have done more. But given that he spent over a thousand dollars, which is a lot, and he's not making that much annually, it's debatable. \n\nIn some cultures, Valentine's Day can be very expensive, and absence might require more gestures. But the key here is that the author tried to make up for it. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about the missed presence than the gifts, but she did appreciate the gifts. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he did put in effort and money. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic given the circumstances. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Both could have communicated better, but given the effort and money spent, the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
