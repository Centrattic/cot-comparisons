I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a guy who spent $1,100 on various gifts for his girlfriend on the evening before Valentine's Day since he was going on a business trip. He got her a Tiffany bracelet, a giant stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and paid for dinner at an expensive restaurant. However, she was disappointed because he wasn't there on actual Valentine's Day and expected more given his income. The argument escalated with the author feeling upset and the girlfriend being annoyed, leading to a cold war where he left for his trip.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and expectations. Valentine's Day is a specific day, and the girlfriend felt that missing it required more effort. The author tried to make up for it with a big gift, but maybe the girlfriend wanted more personal time or specific gestures that can't be replaced by material gifts. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he spent a lot, but his income is $85k, which might be a middle-class job. However, spending $1k is significant. Yet, the girlfriend might feel that since he's missing the day, the material gifts aren't enough. The argument about the author \"faking\" sadness suggests that she felt he was being manipulative, which adds another layer of emotional conflict.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as not fully considering her emotional needs. While spending money can be a way to show love, sometimes people value presence and shared time more. The fact that she was annoyed when he expressed sadness could indicate a miscommunication or differing expectations. The author might not have realized that her disappointment was about his absence rather than the gifts themselves.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He tried to compensate with gifts, but perhaps he didn't address her need for his presence on the actual day. However, he's also in a situation where he had to work. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as unreasonable, but if she communicated her feelings early, he could have adjusted. The author's response, though, was to get defensive, which might have made things worse. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating her desire for his presence and for not handling the situation with more empathy. But the girlfriend's expectations might also be unrealistic. However, since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
