I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent around $1,100, which is a lot. He got a Tiffany bracelet, a huge bear, chocolates, roses, a card, and paid for dinner at an expensive restaurant. But he missed the actual day because he was on a business trip.\n\nThe girlfriend was disappointed, expecting more since he was missing V-Day and he makes $85k. The guy got sad, thinking he did enough, and then the girl accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. The guy ignored her and left for his trip.\n\nFirst, the guy spent a significant amount, which shows he's trying to be generous. But the girl felt it wasn't enough. Maybe she wanted more specific or personal gifts, or maybe she felt the absence of being together on V-Day wasn't compensated enough. The key points here are communication and expectations. Did they discuss what she wanted beforehand? The guy might not have realized she wanted more, but she's in her early 20s, so maybe she's used to a certain standard. However, he's only 22 and making $85k, which isn't super high for someone in that age group, especially in some areas. \n\nThe girl's reaction seems harsh. He spent a lot, and she's accusing him of manipulation when he's genuinely upset. His response was to withdraw, which isn't ideal, but maybe her expectations were unrealistic. He might not be in the wrong for not meeting her expectations if they weren't communicated. On the other hand, maybe he should have asked what she wanted instead of assuming. But he did get her big gifts, so it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think the main issue is the girl's reaction. She's upset over money when he's already put a lot in, and she's not considering his feelings. The guy's sadness was real, but she dismissed it. He's not in the wrong for spending a lot and not meeting her unspoken expectations. So I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
