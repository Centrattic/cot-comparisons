I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a guy who missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip and spent around $1,100 on gifts for his girlfriend. The girlfriend was disappointed, thinking he should have spent more since he earns $85k. The author feels he did enough, but his girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is at fault. He made an effort by getting multiple gifts and dinner, compensating for missing the actual day. He spent a significant amount, which might be a lot for his income level. The girlfriend's expectation seems high, possibly expecting even more given his salary. But is it fair to expect more? Relationships can have different expectations regarding gift-giving. The author might not have known her expectations, and she didn't communicate that clearly. However, he did his best given the circumstances. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him manipulative might be harsh, especially since he was trying to be thoughtful. On the other hand, not buying enough gifts could be seen as not meeting her emotional needs. But the author did make an effort, so maybe he's not entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are communication and mutual expectations. Since he tried and she didn't express her needs, maybe he's not in the wrong. Or perhaps he could have done more research on what she wanted. Hmm. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he made a genuine effort and spent a lot, even if she wanted more. But some might argue he didn't do enough. It's subjective. The main thing is that both should communicate better. So the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
