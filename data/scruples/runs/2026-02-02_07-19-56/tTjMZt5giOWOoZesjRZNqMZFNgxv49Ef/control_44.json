I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend more gifts for Valentine's Day, even though they spent $1,100 and missed the actual day due to a business trip.\n\nFirst, the author gave several expensive gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a giant stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant. The total cost is around $1,100, which is a significant amount. The girlfriend felt it wasn't enough because he's missing V-Day and he makes $85k a year. She thought he should have spent more.\n\nThe author got upset when she expressed disappointment, thinking he had done well. He then pretended to be sad, which she called manipulative, and they ended up separating for the night. Now, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nLooking at the situation, there's a disconnect in expectations. The author believed their spending was appropriate, but the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. Communication seems key here. The author might have assumed that the gifts were sufficient, not realizing the girlfriend wanted something different or more. However, the author's reaction to her disappointment was to express sadness and then ignore her, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling undervalued, especially since he was away for V-Day. But the author's spending was substantial, so it's possible she had different expectations. The author's response of pretending to be sad and then leaving might have been a way to avoid conflict, but it's not productive. Communication is important in relationships, and both sides need to express their feelings without blaming.\n\nThe author might not be entirely wrong, as he did put effort into a nice dinner and expensive gifts. However, not addressing her needs or feelings properly could be a mistake. The issue here is mutual: both parties need to communicate better. The author's reaction was perhaps immature, but the root cause is differing expectations. So, is the author at fault? Possibly, but maybe not entirely. The answer might be nuanced, but given the options A or B, the best choice is B (not in the wrong) because the spending was generous, though communication could improve. However, the manipulation comment and ignoring her might tip it. Hmm, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's expectations vs. the author's actions. The author's spending was high, but maybe the girlfriend wanted a different kind of gesture or more attention. The author's reaction of pretending to be sad and then ignoring her is problematic. So maybe the answer is A (author is wrong) because he didn't validate her feelings and tried to manipulate the situation. But the initial act of spending is not wrong. It's a bit of both, but the answer requires choosing A or B. Since the author's actions in the aftermath (pretending to be sad, ignoring her) are wrong, maybe A is correct. Wait, but the main question is about not buying enough gifts. If the author did spend a lot, then not being in the wrong (B) might be the case. However, the way he handled her disappointment was poor. So, the answer might be A because the author's response was wrong, not the initial gift-giving. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not buying enough gifts. If the gifts were sufficient, then B. But if the author's response was wrong, maybe A. This is tricky. The key is whether the author is at fault for the situation. The main conflict is the girlfriend's expectations vs. the author's actions. The author did spend a lot, so he's not necessarily wrong for not buying more. The wrong part is how he handled her disappointment. But the question is specifically about not buying enough gifts. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong for the spending, but his reaction was wrong. Since the question is about the gifts, the answer is B. However, if the reaction is part of the question, then maybe A. But the original question is phrased as \"AITA For Not Buying My GF Enough Gifts for Valentines Day?\" So the focus is on the gifts. Since he did buy a lot, he's not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
