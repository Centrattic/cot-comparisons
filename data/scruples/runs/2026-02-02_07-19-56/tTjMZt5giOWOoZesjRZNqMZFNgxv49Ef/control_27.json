I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. The situation involves a man who's been dating a woman for over a year, and they had dinner to celebrate since he's going on a business trip and will miss the actual day. He spent around $1,100 on a Tiffany bracelet, a large stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. However, his girlfriend was disappointed because he was missing V-Day and thought he should have spent more given his income. The man felt hurt and accused her of being annoyed, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The man made an effort to compensate for missing the actual day by spending a significant amount. The girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, possibly due to expectations tied to his income. The author is asking if he's at fault here.\n\nThe man's actions seem generous in terms of spending, but the girlfriend's reaction might stem from different expectations. Some people value presence over gifts, especially for a holiday like Valentine's Day. Since he was absent, she might have hoped for more gestures to make up for his absence. However, spending $1k is a lot, and it's subjective whether that's sufficient. The conflict arises from differing views on what's appropriate.\n\nThe man's response when she expressed disappointment was to get sad and then ignore her, which could be seen as dismissive. The girlfriend's frustration might be valid if she felt the gesture didn't meet her emotional needs. The question is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. While the spending was substantial, the absence of being there might have made the gifts less impactful for her. The author might not be entirely wrong, but there could be room for understanding her perspective. However, since he did make an effort and the girlfriend's reaction was about expectations rather than a lack of effort, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
