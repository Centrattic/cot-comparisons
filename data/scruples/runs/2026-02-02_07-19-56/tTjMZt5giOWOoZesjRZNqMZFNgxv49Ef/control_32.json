I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner, etc. He missed V Day because of a business trip and did a dinner to make up for it. She was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and expected more since he makes $85k. He felt he did enough and got defensive, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The guy spent a significant amount, which is a considerable chunk of his income given his salary. He tried to make up for missing the day by having dinner. The girl wanted more because he wasn't present and thought his salary allowed for more spending. \n\nBut maybe the issue isn't just about the money. Sometimes, presence on special days matters more than the actual gifts. The girl might feel that missing the day made her feel neglected, and the gifts, while nice, couldn't replace his being there. The guy might not have realized that her disappointment was more about his absence than the gifts' value. \n\nHe got defensive when she expressed her feelings, which could be seen as dismissive. Instead of validating her feelings, he got sad and argued about the amount spent. That might have hurt her feelings more. The girl might have expected communication and understanding rather than just material compensation.\n\nOn the other hand, he did spend a lot, which shows effort. His salary is $85k, and $1,100 is a significant expense, but maybe not unmanageable. However, the problem isn't just about money; it's about the missed presence. The guy might not have considered that her disappointment was emotional, not just about the gifts' value.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe he didn't address her emotional needs by being absent and then got defensive when she expressed her feelings. Gifts are nice, but the absence might have been the bigger issue. His reaction could have been insensitive. Therefore, he might be partially at fault for not acknowledging her feelings and trying to justify the gifts instead of the absence. But the girl's expectation of more gifts despite his absence might also be a factor. However, in AITA scenarios, the focus is on the actions that caused the problem. The guy's defensiveness and lack of empathy might make him more at fault here. So answer A (Yes) or B (No)? \n\nI think the key points are that he was absent on the day, which matters a lot, and then his reaction to her feelings. Even though he spent money, the main issue might be his absence and not addressing her emotional needs. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the problem is that he missed the day and didn't realize how important presence was, then he might be at fault. His response of getting defensive instead of empathizing with her disappointment adds to it. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
