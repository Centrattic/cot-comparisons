I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 20, they've been together over a year. He's on a business trip starting the next day, so he misses Valentine's Day. They had dinner that night as a substitute. He spent $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. She was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and felt he should have spent more, considering his income. He thought he did well, but she accused him of manipulating by faking sadness.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if he did something wrong. The key points are communication and expectations. He spent a significant amount, but she still felt underwhelmed. Maybe the problem is that he didn't communicate his plans better. He tried to make up for missing the day with a dinner and gifts, but maybe she wanted different gestures or more presence. Since he was gone, maybe she expected something like a special delivery on Valentine's or a thoughtful message. However, he explained his reasoning and thought his spending was enough. \n\nHis reaction when she expressed disappointment might be an issue. He got sad and then said he thought he did well. She might have felt he wasn't listening or dismissing her feelings. The argument led to him ignoring her, which could be seen as dismissive. The question is whether his actions were wrong. \n\nIn relationships, expectations can differ. If he had discussed what he planned to do before the trip, maybe she would have felt better. But he did go above and beyond in terms of spending. However, absence can lead to higher expectations. The issue might be that he didn't consider her need for presence, even if he couldn't be there. But he did try to compensate with gifts and dinner. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether his actions met her expectations. Since she felt he should have done more, but he spent a lot, it's a clash in expectations. The key is whether he failed to meet her emotional needs despite the spending. If his response was defensive and dismissive, that's a problem. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at communication and effort. If he made an effort but communication was lacking, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if he ignored her feelings and didn't try to understand, he could be at fault. The final answer might be A (he's wrong) because he didn't communicate properly and his reaction was dismissive. Alternatively, B if the spending was sufficient and she's being unreasonable. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because of the communication and emotional response issues.\n"
