I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts.\n\nSo the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 20, they've been together over a year. He's going on a business trip, so they had dinner that night instead. He spent around $1,100 on various gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, a card, and an expensive dinner. The girlfriend seemed disappointed, expecting more because he's missing actual Valentine's Day and he makes $85k a year. He felt he did enough, but she accused him of trying to manipulate her by faking sadness. He left, and she took an Uber home.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the expectations vs. the actions. He spent a lot, but she wanted more. Is there a cultural norm about Valentine's Day spending? Maybe. But he's in a different country (business trip), so he couldn't be there. He tried to compensate with a big dinner and gifts. The cost was significant relative to his income\u2014$1,100 when he's making $85k annually. That's about 1.3% of his annual income, which isn't insignificant but maybe not unreasonable for a special occasion.\n\nBut she felt it wasn't enough. Her reaction was that he should have spent more, given his income. His response was feeling sad, which she dismissed as manipulation. That could be a communication problem. Maybe she felt he wasn't valuing the relationship enough. But he might not see his spending as excessive. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, he made an effort, but maybe didn't meet her expectations. But relationships are about mutual expectations. If he didn't know she wanted more, is that his fault? On the other hand, she might have communicated her expectations better. The argument over communication and whether his reaction was genuine or manipulative could be a red flag. However, he's in a stressful situation, leaving for a trip. \n\nThe options are A (he's in the wrong) or B (not). Considering that both parties have perspectives, but he did make a significant effort, though she felt it wasn't enough. The communication breakdown is mutual. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he acted based on his understanding of her preferences, and she didn't express her higher expectations, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But maybe he should have anticipated that missing V-Day entirely would require more compensation. It's tricky. \n\nIn AITA threads, often the advice is about compromise and communication. If he could have done more, but didn't, maybe he's at fault. But given his spending was over a thousand, maybe not. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh, but her expectations might be unrealistic. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides. However, since he made a good effort and the expectations weren't clearly communicated, the answer is probably B.\n"
