I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day. \n\nFirst, the context: The author, a 22-year-old male, has been in a relationship with his girlfriend for over a year. He went to great lengths to make up for missing Valentine's Day by spending $1,100 on gifts including a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant, and a card. However, his girlfriend was still disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and felt he should have spent more, considering his income of $85k. The argument escalated, with the author feeling hurt and the girlfriend accusing him of faking sadness to manipulate her.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider relationship expectations, communication, and mutual understanding. The author made a significant financial commitment to compensate for missing the actual holiday. Spending over a thousand dollars is substantial, especially for someone earning $85k annually. However, the girlfriend's expectation of even more spending might be based on her own perceptions of his income or perhaps societal pressures around gift-giving.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author and his girlfriend discuss what was expected for Valentine's Day before the business trip? If the author didn't know she expected more, then the issue might be a lack of communication rather than his fault. On the other hand, if she had previously expressed her expectations, he might share some responsibility. However, in this case, the girlfriend mentioned her expectations after the fact, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional response. The author felt his gestures were sufficient, while she felt they were inadequate. The girlfriend's reaction of being annoyed and calling him manipulative for expressing his feelings could indicate a miscommunication or differing values. The author's decision to focus on the dinner as a substitute might not have aligned with her need for physical presence on the actual day, which is a common issue in long-distance or situational relationships.\n\nFinancially, spending $1,100 is considerable, but it's also possible that the girlfriend expected even more extravagant gifts given his income. However, it's important to note that income doesn't necessarily dictate relationship expectations. The author might not have the means or willingness to spend beyond a certain point, which the girlfriend might not have considered.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the argument stems from unmet expectations. The author did his part based on his interpretation of what was needed, while the girlfriend had different expectations. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether he should have anticipated her desires better. However, without prior communication, it's hard to fault him entirely. The girlfriend's reaction, accusing him of manipulation, might be more about her own feelings of disappointment than his actual wrongdoing.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation seems more about a mismatch in expectations and communication rather than one party being clearly in the wrong. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and he made a good-faith effort to celebrate despite being away, the answer leans towards B (No), as the issue is mutual misunderstanding rather than his fault.\n"
