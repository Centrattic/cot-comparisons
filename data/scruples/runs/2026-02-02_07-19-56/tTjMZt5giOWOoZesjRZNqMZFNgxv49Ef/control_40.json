I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not buying their girlfriend enough gifts for Valentine's Day.\n\nFirst, the author spent $1,100 on gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a 5ft bear, Godiva chocolates, a dozen roses, a card, and an expensive dinner. The girlfriend was disappointed because he missed Valentine's Day due to a business trip and expected more given his income. \n\nThe key points here are the expectations and communication. The author thought spending over a thousand dollars was generous, especially since they had dinner to make up for missing the actual day. The girlfriend might feel that because he didn't spend the day with her and he earns $85k, he should have spent more. However, $1,100 is a significant amount. The author's income is $85k, which is a salary, so spending over a thousand in one go might be a big chunk of his monthly income. \n\nThe girlfriend accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her, which is a serious accusation and might have been harsh, especially in the context of the situation. The author's reaction to being criticized could be seen as hurt, which is understandable. The couple might have different views on what constitutes a generous gift. The author might not have known his partner wanted more, and she might not have communicated her expectations clearly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's possible that the author didn't meet the girlfriend's specific expectations, but the amount spent was substantial. It's also a matter of whether spending more is necessary when the day was made up with a dinner. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as disproportionate, especially if the author did his best within his means. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because he tried to make up for missing Valentine's with a nice dinner and expensive gifts, and the girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic given the situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
