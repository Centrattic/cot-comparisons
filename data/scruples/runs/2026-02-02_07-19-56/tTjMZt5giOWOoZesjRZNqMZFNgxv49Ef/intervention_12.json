I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The author, a 22-year-old guy, is going on a business trip and missed Valentine's Day. He spent $1,100 on gifts like a Tiffany bracelet, a big bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. His girlfriend was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and expected more since he makes $85k. The author is upset and thinks he did enough, but she accused him of manipulating by faking sadness.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if he's in the wrong. The key points here are expectations and communication. He tried to make up for missing the day with a big dinner and gifts. However, she felt it wasn't enough. The amount he spent is significant, but she might be used to more, especially if she expects being present on the day itself. But he's making $85k, which is a decent salary, so maybe she thinks he can spend more. However, $1,100 is a lot of his income. \n\nThe author's reaction to her disappointment is also a factor. When she said she expected more, he got sad and accused her of manipulating him. Maybe he could have handled the conversation better. Instead of getting defensive, he might have tried to understand her feelings more. Also, leaving right after the argument might not have helped the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, she could have communicated her expectations better. Maybe she expected something specific that he didn't know about. But he did make an effort to replace the day. The question is whether his actions were sufficient. Since he's not there on the actual day, some people might say the gesture is less meaningful. But he did put in a lot of effort and money.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong because he made a sincere effort, but maybe he could have considered her feelings more and communicated better. The girlfriend's reaction is also harsh, accusing him of faking emotions. However, the fact that he left without resolving the issue might make him seem dismissive. The answer could be A or B depending on perspective. But the user thinks he's in the wrong, so maybe I should lean towards that. However, given that he tried his best and she had unmet expectations, it's not entirely his fault. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because he made a good effort, but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
