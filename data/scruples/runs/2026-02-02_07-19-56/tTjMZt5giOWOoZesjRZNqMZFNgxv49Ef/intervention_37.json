I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip and spent around $1,100 on their girlfriend, including a Tiffany bracelet, a big stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, and dinner. The girlfriend was disappointed, expecting more since he earns about $85k a year. The author was hurt and thought he did a good job, but she accused him of faking sadness and manipulating her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author tried to make up for missing V-Day with a big gift, which is significant in terms of money. But the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough, maybe because he was absent and she expected more effort or presence. The author's response when she expressed disappointment was to get sad and then ignore her, which might have been hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author might have assumed that the gifts were sufficient, but maybe he didn't discuss with her beforehand what she wanted. Also, his reaction to her disappointment could have been better. Instead of getting defensive or ignoring her, maybe he should have listened more. \n\nThe girlfriend's feeling that he should have spent more, given his income, might be about the perceived effort rather than the actual amount. Even though $1,100 is a lot, she might have wanted something more personal or for him to be there. The author's reaction of pretending to be sad could be seen as manipulative, as he accused. \n\nIn relationships, effort and communication are important. Missing a significant day like Valentine's and then trying to compensate might not fully address the emotional aspect. The author's not being there could be a bigger issue than the gifts. However, the amount he spent is considerable, so it's a balance between financial effort and presence. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible because he didn't meet her emotional needs by being absent and his reaction could have been dismissive. But the girlfriend's expectations might also be unrealistic. However, the author could have handled the situation better by understanding her feelings and not lashing out or withdrawing. Therefore, he might share some responsibility.\n"
