I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The guy is a 22-year-old guy who's been with his girlfriend for about a year. She's 20. He's going on a business trip right after they had dinner, so he missed actual Valentine's Day. He spent around $1,100 on gifts, which seems like a lot. The gifts included a Tiffany bracelet, a large stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, a dozen roses, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. The GF was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and he makes a \"lot of money\" (he makes $85k a year). She thinks he should have spent more.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is at fault. The key points here are expectations around gift-giving, communication, and whether the amount spent was appropriate. The guy argues he spent over a grand, which is a significant amount, especially for someone earning $85k. But the GF felt it wasn't enough because he wasn't there, and she expected more given his income.\n\nI need to consider if the guy was wrong for not meeting her expectations. Maybe the issue is that expectations weren't communicated. He might have thought the gifts were sufficient, but she wanted more because he wasn't present. Also, he was trying to make up for missing the day with the dinner, but she still felt let down. The response from the GF was harsh\u2014calling him fake and manipulative when he was sad. That might be her fault too. But the question is about the author's actions. Did he do something wrong? He spent a lot, but maybe he didn't consider that she valued presence over gifts. However, he was on a business trip, so absence is unavoidable. Maybe he's not wrong because he tried to compensate with gifts, and the GF's reaction is unreasonable. Alternatively, maybe he should have done something even more elaborate since he's making good money. But $1k is a lot, especially for a 22-year-old. Another angle: he got her all the gifts, but she wanted more because he wasn't there. So, maybe the conflict is about the value she places on presence vs. gifts. The author's mistake might be not understanding her priorities. But he's the one who's out of town, so he can't be there. It's a tough call. The GF's reaction seems a bit extreme, but maybe their communication was off. The author's question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is B (not wrong), then the reasoning is that he spent a lot and she's being unreasonable. If it's A, then maybe he should have spent more or done something else. I think the answer leans towards B because he tried to make it up to her with gifts, and her expectations might be unrealistic. Also, $1k is a lot, especially for someone earning 85k. But maybe the GF's reaction is the problem here. The author's actions aren't in the wrong because he did what he thought was right, even if she didn't appreciate it. So, the answer is B.\n"
