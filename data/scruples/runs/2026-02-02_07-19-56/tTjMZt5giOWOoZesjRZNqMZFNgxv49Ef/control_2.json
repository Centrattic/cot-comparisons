I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about Valentine's Day gifts.\n\nFirst, the guy spent around $1,100 on his girlfriend. He got her a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant. He missed Valentine's Day because of a business trip. They had dinner to make up for it. \n\nShe seemed disappointed and said he should have spent more because he's making $85k a year. He thought $1k was enough, considering he doesn't make that much yet. She accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. He left and they'll talk later.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, spending $1k is a lot. But maybe expectations differ. If she expected more because he's making a higher salary, but he's only on track for $85k, which isn't super high. Also, the fact that she's disappointed because he's missing V-Day is a point. He tried to make it up with dinner and gifts. \n\nBut maybe she wanted specific gifts that he didn't get, or maybe her reaction was too harsh. The key here is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. He spent a significant amount, but perhaps she felt it wasn't enough. However, he's not in the wrong if he believed he did enough. The argument is more about differing expectations. \n\nHe didn't ignore her, he tried to talk, but she accused him of faking sadness. He left for the trip and said they'd talk later. The main issue is communication. He may not be in the wrong if he acted based on his own judgment of what's appropriate. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No) because he spent a lot and had good intentions. The wrong here is more on her for expecting more without considering his effort. Unless there's a cultural norm where $1k isn't enough, but that's situational. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
