I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about Valentine's Day gifts. The user is a guy who's been with his girlfriend for over a year. He's going on a business trip and misses Valentine's Day, so he had a dinner the night before. He spent about $1,100 on various gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a huge stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, roses, a card, and dinner at an expensive restaurant. His girlfriend was disappointed because he missed the actual day and she thought he should have spent more, given his income is around $85k a year. He felt he did well, but she accused him of faking sadness and being manipulative. He left and they're going to talk later.\n\nFirst, I should consider the basics. The user spent a significant amount of money, over a thousand dollars, which is a lot. However, his girlfriend was still disappointed. The key points here might be expectations. The girlfriend might have expected more because he was absent on Valentine's Day and he makes a good income. On the other hand, the user felt he had already spent a lot and tried to compensate with a dinner and gifts. \n\nNow, the user's actions: he spent a lot, but maybe the way he approached it wasn't what the girlfriend wanted. She wanted more, possibly different gifts or more presence. Since he was going on a trip, maybe she wanted a different way to celebrate. But he tried to compensate with gifts and dinner. However, she felt he was trying to buy his way out of being there. The user's reaction when she expressed disappointment was to get sad and then ignore her. He accused himself of maybe manipulating her by faking sadness. \n\nThe user's actions could be seen as not fully considering her emotional needs. While he provided material gifts, maybe she wanted more emotional presence or a different plan. His response to her disappointment might have been dismissive. He didn't address her feelings effectively, instead getting defensive and then ignoring her. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user tried to make up for missing the day with gifts, but perhaps didn't validate her feelings or show enough empathy when she expressed disappointment. His reaction of getting sad and then ignoring her could have made her feel unheard. The girlfriend's reaction was frustration because he wasn't meeting her expectations, and his response wasn't supportive. \n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? It might depend on whether he should have anticipated that his absence would lead her to expect more, and if his response to her disappointment was appropriate. While spending a lot is one factor, the emotional aspect is another. If he failed to communicate or empathize, that could be the issue. \n\nIn summary, the user might be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings adequately and possibly underestimating the importance of his presence despite the gifts. The girlfriend's reaction, while possibly harsh, might stem from unmet emotional needs. Therefore, the answer is A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
