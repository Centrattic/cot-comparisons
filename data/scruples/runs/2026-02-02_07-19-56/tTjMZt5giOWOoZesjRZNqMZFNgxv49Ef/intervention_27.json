I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who's 22, his girlfriend is 20. They've been together for over a year. He's going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week, so he misses Valentine's Day. They had dinner tonight to make up for it. He got her several gifts: a Tiffany bracelet, a huge 5ft stuffed bear, Godiva chocolates, a dozen roses, a card, and paid for dinner at an expensive restaurant. The total cost was about $1,100. He thought he did a good job because she likes gifts, and he's making $85k this year. She was disappointed during dinner, said she expected more because he was missing actual Valentine's Day and he makes a lot. He got sad, said he thought he did well, and she was annoyed, saying he shouldn't be sad, she should be, and that he was trying to manipulate her by faking sadness. The author ignored her and left for the airport, she took an Uber home, and they'll talk next Saturday. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants the opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the main points. The author spent a significant amount on gifts and dinner. $1,100 is a lot for a 22-year-old, especially considering his girlfriend is 20. However, her reaction was disappointment because she expected even more. The key here is the expectation vs. what was given. The author might feel he did enough, but she felt it wasn't enough. \n\nNow, in relationships, expectations can vary. The girlfriend might have different standards, especially if she comes from a background where such spending is the norm. Alternatively, the author might feel that his spending was generous given his income. However, the author is making $85k, which is a decent salary for someone his age. The girlfriend might feel that with that income, he should have spent more. \n\nThe conflict arises when he expresses his sadness and she accuses him of manipulating her emotions. The author might not have considered her perspective that missing actual Valentine's Day means he should have done more. He might have thought the dinner and gifts were sufficient compensation, but she felt it wasn't. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did spend a lot, but maybe he didn't communicate his intentions clearly. He might have thought the gestures would be enough, but didn't account for her feelings about missing the actual day. On the other hand, her reaction could be seen as unreasonable if he spent $1k already. However, the problem might be that he didn't ask her what she wanted or consider her feelings about missing the day. \n\nAnother angle is that he didn't check in with her about whether she wanted a big gift or if she valued his presence more. Since he was missing the actual day, perhaps she wanted him to be there, and the gifts couldn't compensate. But he did make up for it with dinner. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. Saying he was trying to manipulate her by faking sadness is a harsh accusation and could indicate that she felt disrespected. The author's response of ignoring her and leaving might have been abrupt, but given he was about to travel, maybe he felt it was necessary to not escalate the situation. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a grey area. The author might not be in the wrong because he tried to make up for missing the day with a generous gift. However, he could have done better by discussing with her beforehand what she wanted. Alternatively, her expectations might be unrealistic given the circumstances. \n\nBut since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his actions were insufficient. If the girlfriend felt he didn't do enough despite his spending, but he did spend a considerable amount, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he didn't consider her feelings about missing the actual day, then he might share some responsibility. \n\nGiven that he made an effort to compensate, and she's the one who expressed disappointment, perhaps the fault isn't entirely his. However, the fact that he didn't acknowledge her feelings and got defensive might contribute to the problem. \n\nBut in terms of objective wrong, it's hard to say. The answer could be either way. However, the user thinks he is in the wrong. The author spent $1k, which is significant, but maybe the girlfriend's expectation was higher. However, if he had communicated better, maybe the conflict could have been avoided. \n\nIn conclusion, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong (B) because he tried to make up for missing the day with a generous gift. However, his response to her disappointment could have been better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wrong is about not meeting her expectations despite the spending, it's subjective. Since the situation is complex, but the user's initial thought is A (he's in the wrong), but I have to decide based on analysis.\n"
