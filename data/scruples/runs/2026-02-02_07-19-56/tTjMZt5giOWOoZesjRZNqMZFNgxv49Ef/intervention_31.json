I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy who spent $1,100 on gifts for his girlfriend for Valentine's Day but she was disappointed because he wasn't there on the actual day and thought he should have spent more given his income. He's upset that she's not appreciative and they ended up having an argument before he left on a trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy put in a lot of money and effort, spending over a thousand dollars, which is significant. He's making $85k a year, which is a decent income, and he's trying to compensate for missing the actual Valentine's Day by having a dinner and giving gifts. The girlfriend, on the other hand, felt that since he wasn't there on the actual day and considering his income, he should have spent more. She felt disappointed and thought he was faking sadness to manipulate her, which led to an argument.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate it. The key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend might have had higher expectations because he wasn't there on the actual day, and maybe she didn't communicate her feelings clearly before. The guy thought he did a good job, but she felt it wasn't enough. \n\nIt's possible that the guy didn't consider her emotional needs beyond the physical gifts. Missing the actual Valentine's Day might have made her feel neglected, and even though he spent money, she might have wanted quality time or different gestures. The argument about him \"faking\" sadness could indicate that she felt he wasn't being genuine or was trying to guilt-trip her. \n\nHowever, spending $1k is a lot, and he's making $85k, so from his perspective, he might feel he's given a generous gift. The issue might be that their expectations were mismatched. The girl might have wanted more personal connection or specific experiences rather than material gifts. The guy's reaction of getting sad and then ignoring her could have been hurtful, but he was responding to her disappointment. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It depends on whether he was aware of her unmet expectations beforehand. If he didn't communicate or consider her feelings about his absence, that's his fault. But if he did what he thought was right and she had different expectations, it's a communication issue. However, the fact that she expressed disappointment and he responded defensively, leading to an argument, suggests that he didn't handle it well. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both could have communicated better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks A, but maybe B. I need to decide based on the situation. The guy made an effort but maybe didn't consider her emotional side. The girlfriend's reaction might be a result of unmet expectations, but his response could have been more understanding. However, he's not entirely wrong for trying to compensate. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he made a significant effort, but there's room for improvement in communication. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be unreasonable. Alternatively, if the author didn't listen to her feelings and got defensive, maybe A. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The key is whether his actions were wrong. Since he tried to make up for missing V-day with gifts and dinner, and the girlfriend still felt it wasn't enough, perhaps he isn't in the wrong. The problem is more about differing expectations and communication rather than him being clearly wrong. So answer B.\n"
