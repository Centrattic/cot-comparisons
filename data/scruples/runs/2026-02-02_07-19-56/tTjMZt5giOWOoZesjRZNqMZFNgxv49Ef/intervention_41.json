I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy missing Valentine's Day because of a business trip and giving gifts the night before. His girlfriend was disappointed, said he should have spent more given his income, and he got upset, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, the guy spent around $1,100, which is a lot. He got a Tiffany bracelet, a huge bear, chocolates, roses, dinner at an expensive restaurant. That's a significant effort. He's making $85k a year, which is decent, but the girlfriend thought it wasn't enough because he was missing the actual day. She also accused him of faking sadness to manipulate her. He didn't argue with her but instead went to his place afterward.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he did spend a considerable amount. On the other, the girlfriend felt it wasn't enough. But is it his fault? He tried to make up for missing the day by doing an elaborate dinner and gifts. The girlfriend's reaction seems unreasonable. The guy didn't spend the entire $85k; $1k is a chunk but not unrealistic for a one-time gift. The girlfriend's expectation that his income should dictate the gift cost might be unrealistic. Also, accusing him of faking sadness is harsh. He didn't do anything wrong by spending what he did. The fact that she took an Uber home while he had to leave for the airport might show she was inconsiderate. The guy tried to be thoughtful but was met with disappointment. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
