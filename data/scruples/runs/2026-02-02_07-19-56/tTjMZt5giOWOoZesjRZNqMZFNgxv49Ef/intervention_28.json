I'm going on a business trip starting tomorrow for a week so will miss V Day and we did a dinner tonight to make up for it. I got my GF Tiffany Bracelet, huge stuffed bear like 5ft tall bear, box of chocolates from Godiva, a dozen roses a card and paid for dinner of course at an expensive restaurant this evening. Cost of all of this was about $1,100, I thought I did so well and she really likes/appreciates gifts so I thought my level of spending would be good. She seemed a bit disappointed during dinner though and when I brought her back to my place I asked her what was up and she said she expected more as I'm missing actual V day and I make a lot of money ( I'm on track to make 85k this year) so I should have bought her more. I was astonished as I just spent over a grand on her and I don't even make that much! I got kinda sad and said basically I thought I did got her nice stuff and did make up for missing the day. She was annoyed and said I shouldn't be sad she should be and that I'm trying to manipulate her by \"faking\" being sad and it was an asshole move. I ignored her for the rest of the night and got my things to go to the airport as I had a flight soon (typing this otw to the airport), she took an uber home and I just said we'll talk more about it when I get back next Saturday. \n\nAITA For this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying his girlfriend enough gifts on Valentine's Day. The situation is that he's going on a business trip and missed Valentine's Day. They had a dinner to make up for it, and he spent about $1,100 on various gifts. However, his girlfriend was disappointed, expected more because he's missing the actual day and he makes $85k a year. The author is defensive, got sad when she didn't like it, and they ended up in an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author spent a significant amount of money, which is a lot, especially if he's making 85k a year. That's a non-trivial amount. He made an effort to compensate by having a dinner and giving multiple gifts. But his girlfriend felt it wasn't enough because he missed the actual day and expected more given his income. \n\nCommunication is a big factor here. Maybe the girlfriend had different expectations. The author might have assumed that the dinner and gifts would suffice as a substitute for Valentine's Day, but she might have wanted specific gestures on the actual day. The fact that she mentioned his income could imply that she felt he could afford more, but he's already spent a significant portion of his income. \n\nThe author's reaction: he was astonished, got sad, and then seemed to shut down the conversation. He also accused her of being annoyed and manipulating him by faking sadness. That's a problem because it's not his place to call her out on her emotions. Instead of addressing her concerns, he became defensive and left. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, feeling disappointed is valid, especially if she had certain expectations. The author's spending might be generous in a vacuum, but the timing and the missed day could be an issue. The argument here is whether the effort and spending were appropriate given the circumstances. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not discussing the expectations beforehand. If he was going on a trip, maybe they should have talked about how to celebrate and set mutual expectations. Also, his reaction to her disappointment was dismissive. Instead of listening, he got defensive and accused her of manipulation, which could have made the situation worse. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's not just about the spending amount but how they handled the situation. The girlfriend's disappointment is her valid feeling, and the author's response was not constructive. The author might not be entirely at fault for the spending amount, but his reaction and communication style could be where he's wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the wrong is about the spending or the communication. If the question is about the spending, maybe he's not wrong because $1k is a lot. But if it's about handling the situation and communication, he might be in the wrong. The user's question is about \"not buying enough gifts,\" but the conflict escalated beyond that. The author's defensiveness and invalidating her feelings are problematic. Therefore, even if the spending was sufficient, his response was wrong. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because of the way he handled the situation, not necessarily the spending.\n"
