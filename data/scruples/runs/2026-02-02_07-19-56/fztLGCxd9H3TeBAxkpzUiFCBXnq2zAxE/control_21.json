She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person wrote a fake customer review to get their coworker to improve. The coworker was lazy, got complaints, and had a bad work ethic. The author thought that since the coworker was self-conscious about reviews, this would push them to change. It worked, but now the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the ethics here. The coworker was underperforming, and the normal methods (talking to her, retraining) didn't work. The author used deception by faking a review, which is a lie. But the coworker improved after that. \n\nOn one hand, the author's action wasn't malicious; they wanted to help the coworker improve and the business. The coworker did change for the better. But on the other hand, lying is generally considered wrong. The author manipulated a situation by using a fake review, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the coworker might not have been aware they were being targeted, which could make the situation worse if found out.\n\nAdditionally, the coworker was protected because of being friends with the owner's daughter, so the author might have felt like they couldn't get the issue resolved through proper channels. But that doesn't justify unethical behavior. The right approach might have been to escalate the issue more formally or find an alternative solution rather than using a fake review.\n\nThe author's guilt suggests they know they did something questionable. Even if the outcome was positive, the method was questionable. So, while the intent was good, the action itself was ethically wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
