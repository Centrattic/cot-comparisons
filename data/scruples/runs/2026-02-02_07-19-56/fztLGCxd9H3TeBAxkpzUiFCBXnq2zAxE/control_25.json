She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. \n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker was really lazy, didn't perform well, and the manager tried to talk to her but nothing worked. The coworker's friend is the owner's daughter, so she wasn't fired. The author found out that the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake review. The coworker changed her behavior after that.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, writing a fake review is deception. It's not exactly a crime, but it's unethical. The coworker didn't have a chance to respond, and it's possible that the review could have caused her real harm, even if it worked out. The coworker improved, but maybe the method was underhanded. The author felt guilty, which is a sign that they think it's wrong.\n\nBut on the other hand, the manager tried other methods that didn't work, and the coworker was protected because of her friend. The fake review was a way to motivate her when other methods failed. However, using deception to manipulate someone's behavior might not be the right approach, even if it had a good outcome. There's also the question of whether the manager should have escalated the issue differently, maybe talked to the owner about the problem since the coworker is protected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were unethical and possibly crossed a line, even if the intention was to help. The right approach would have been to talk to higher management if they couldn't resolve it through direct communication. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
