She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the fake review is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a manager at a small restaurant. Their coworker was very lazy, didn't greet customers, texted during shifts, and received complaints. The coworker is friends with the owner's daughter, so she wasn't fired despite her bad work ethic. The author found out that she read customer reviews and was self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review describing her and her poor service. After the review, the coworker changed her appearance and improved her work. The author is now feeling guilty and wondering if they should have just talked to her instead.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the wrong thing by writing a fake review. Let me think about the ethical aspects here.\n\nFirst, writing a fake review is deception. The coworker had no idea it was fake, so she was being manipulated. The author's intention was to improve her work ethic, but the method involved lying. Is deception ever justified? Sometimes people argue that the ends justify the means, but in this case, the coworker was changed for the better. However, the author didn't directly confront her, which could have been a more honest approach.\n\nAlso, the coworker's behavior was affecting the whole team. The author tried talking and training before, which didn't work. Maybe the fake review was a last resort. But in a professional setting, it's important to handle issues through proper channels. The author bypassed that by using a fake review, which might have violated trust and company policies.\n\nAnother angle: the coworker improved, so the outcome is positive. But the method used could have long-term consequences. If the coworker found out the review was fake, it might damage trust further. Also, the author's employer might not be happy if they discovered this, especially since it involved their own employee.\n\nLegally, writing fake reviews can be problematic. It's against the terms of service of most review platforms and could lead to penalties if discovered. Ethically, it's a breach of integrity. Even if the intention was good, the action is still misleading.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker was protected because of her friendship with the owner's daughter. The author might not have the power to fire her, so their options were limited. The fake review was a way to influence her behavior without direct confrontation, which didn't work before.\n\nBut even in a difficult situation, the right approach is to follow proper procedures. The author could have documented the coworker's issues, presented them to management, or suggested a formal evaluation. Using a fake review is a kind of sabotage, which is not a professional solution.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome was positive, the method used was unethical and unprofessional. The author is in the wrong because they used deception instead of addressing the issue through appropriate channels.\n"
