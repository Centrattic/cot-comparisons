She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a manager who wrote a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The coworker was lazy, had a bad attitude, and the owner didn't want to fire her because she's friends with the owner's daughter. The manager found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review. The coworker changed her behavior after that. Now the manager feels guilty, wondering if they should have talked to her instead.\n\nSo, the main question is whether writing a fake review was the wrong approach. Let me think about the ethical aspects here. Manipulation vs. positive change. The coworker improved, but the method was deceptive. \n\nIs deception ever justified? In some cases, people might argue that if all else failed and the coworker's performance was affecting the business, then maybe it's understandable. However, using someone's insecurities against them is ethically questionable. The author used the coworker's self-consciousness about her appearance and her job performance to manipulate her into changing. That's a bit underhanded.\n\nAlso, the coworker didn't know the review was fake, so her improvement wasn't based on genuine understanding or willingness to improve through proper communication. She was just scared of a bad review. That might not be sustainable or fair. The manager could have had a direct conversation, maybe with the owner's support, to address the issues without deception.\n\nBut the manager tried talking to her before, and it didn't work. So they felt forced to take unconventional measures. However, as a manager, they have a responsibility to handle such situations professionally. Spreading fake reviews could be considered unethical, even if it had a positive outcome. There's also potential legal issues if the review was defamatory or if it violated company policies.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker did improve, and the business might benefit from her better performance. The manager's intention was to help, not to harm. But the means were unethical. The key point is the use of deception and manipulation rather than honest communication.\n\nIn most professional settings, especially in management, the correct approach would be to address the issue through proper channels, like HR or direct supervision, even if the owner's daughter is involved. The manager might not have enough authority to handle it alone, but creating a fake review is crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method used was deceptive and unprofessional, even though the outcome was positive.\n"
