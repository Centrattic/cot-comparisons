She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. The scenario involves a manager at a small business where a coworker was underperforming. The coworker is the best friend of the owner's daughter, so she wasn't getting fired despite poor behavior. The author, knowing the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, wrote a fake negative review that described her uniquely. The coworker changed her appearance and improved her work ethic after reading it. The author now feels guilty, wondering if they should have tried talking to her instead.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the author's method of handling the problem. They chose to deceive by creating a fake review to manipulate the coworker into changing her behavior. The question is whether this is an ethical action. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, deception is generally considered wrong, especially in a professional setting. The author didn't use proper channels to address the coworker's performance. Instead, they resorted to a personal and deceptive tactic. Even though the outcome was positive, the means used were unethical. \n\nThe coworker's improved work ethic is a result of fear or the desire to avoid negative reviews, not from genuine understanding or willingness to improve. The author didn't give the coworker the opportunity to address the issue through direct communication, which could have been a more respectful approach. \n\nAdditionally, the author's position as a manager might have given them the authority to address performance issues formally. By not using that role to implement proper training or discipline, the author bypassed their responsibilities. \n\nHowever, there's also the context of the coworker's close relationship with the owner's daughter, which might have made direct confrontation difficult. But that doesn't justify unethical methods. The author should have explored other options, like discussing the issue with the owner or HR if available, rather than using deception. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if the fake review could be considered defamation or harassment, the author could face consequences. However, since it's a small business and the review was fake, it might not meet legal thresholds, but it's still ethically questionable. \n\nThe author's guilt and reflection on alternative methods (like talking to the coworker) suggest they recognize some wrongdoing. The fact that they feel the need to ask if they're in the wrong in an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) context further indicates their internal conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome was positive, the method was unethical and unprofessional. The author is in the wrong for using deception to manipulate a coworker instead of addressing the issue through appropriate channels.\n"
