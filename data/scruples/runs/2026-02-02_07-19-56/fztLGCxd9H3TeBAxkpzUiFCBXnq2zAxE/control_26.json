She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, consider the situation. The coworker was lazy, had a poor work ethic, and there were repeated complaints. The owner didn't want to fire her because she's friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review. The coworker changed her behavior after seeing it, but now the author feels guilty.\n\nNow, the key points to analyze: \n\n1. **Intent vs. Action**: The author's intent was to help the coworker improve, which might seem noble. However, the method involved deception (fake review) and manipulation. \n\n2. **Ethical Considerations**: Writing a fake review is a form of fraud. It's unethical because it misrepresents facts and could have led to serious consequences if the coworker had been unfairly judged by actual customers or management. Even if the coworker improved, the means were dishonest.\n\n3. **Workplace Dynamics**: Normally, addressing performance issues should be done through proper channels\u2014like direct communication, training, or involving management. Bypassing those steps by using a fake review undermines trust and proper procedures.\n\n4. **Potential Harms**: The coworker might have felt humiliated or stressed, even if she improved. The author's actions could have caused emotional distress. Also, if the owner discovered the fake review, it might lead to conflict or damage the author's credibility.\n\n5. **Alternative Solutions**: The author mentions they could have tried talking to the coworker again. While previous attempts failed, maybe there were other strategies, like documenting her behavior and discussing it with the owner, or seeking HR advice if available.\n\n6. **Legal Aspects**: Depending on the location, fake reviews could be illegal, especially if they're defamatory. The coworker might have a case if she felt her reputation was harmed, even temporarily.\n\nPutting this all together, even though the outcome was positive (the coworker improved), the method used was unethical and potentially harmful. The author bypassed proper channels, used deception, and could have caused unnecessary harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
