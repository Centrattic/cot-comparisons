She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake customer review about their coworker to improve her work ethic. The scenario is that the coworker was lazy, had poor work habits, and the author, a manager, used a fake review to shame her into changing. The coworker improved, but the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, fake reviews can be problematic because they mislead customers and might violate terms of service of review platforms. Ethically, the author is manipulating a coworker's perception by lying, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The coworker didn't get a chance to respond or defend herself, which is a problem in any conflict resolution scenario.\n\nThe employer's perspective is important too. The author is a manager, so using deceptive tactics to manage an employee might be unprofessional. The employer might not appreciate the author taking matters into their own hands, especially since the employee was the best friend of the owner's daughter. The right approach would have been to follow proper channels\u2014documenting issues, formal retraining, or discussing with higher management.\n\nThe coworker's improvement is a positive outcome, but the method used to achieve it is questionable. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the ethical dilemma. Even though the coworker improved, the means of achieving that improvement involved deception and public shaming, which are not constructive methods for personal growth.\n\nIn a professional setting, open communication and constructive feedback are standard. The author bypassed these steps, which could lead to a hostile work environment if others find out. Also, if the owner discovered the fake review, it could damage the author's credibility and the business's reputation.\n\nSo, considering the legal, ethical, and professional implications, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because they used deceptive and unethical methods to influence a coworker instead of following proper management procedures.\n"
