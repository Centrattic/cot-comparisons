She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The author is a manager who had a problematic coworker. The coworker was lazy, got complaints, and wasn't fired because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The manager wrote a fake negative review targeting her, knowing she read reviews and was self-conscious. The coworker changed her behavior after that.\n\nFirst, the manager's intent was to improve the coworker's work ethic without getting her fired. They felt other methods hadn't worked. But the method involved deception and potentially violating privacy by writing a fake review. Even if the outcome was positive, the means might be questionable. \n\nIs it right to use a fake review to manipulate someone into changing? The coworker didn't consent to that method. Also, the manager's role is to address issues through proper channels. Using a fake review could be seen as a violation of trust and ethical standards. Even if the coworker improved, the method was underhanded. The guilt the author feels suggests they know this. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
