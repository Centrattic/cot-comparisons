She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the manager who wrote a fake review is in the wrong. The scenario is that the coworker was underperforming, and the manager resorted to a fake review to make her improve. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. Even if the intention was good\u2014to help the coworker improve\u2014it's still underhanded. The coworker had a history of poor performance, and while others tried to address it, the manager took a more extreme step.\n\nThe coworker did change her behavior after seeing the fake review, but that doesn't necessarily justify the method. The manager could have faced consequences if the owner discovered the fake review, which might damage trust in the workplace. Also, manipulating someone's self-esteem through fabricated feedback isn't a respectful approach. \n\nHowever, the coworker did improve, and maybe the manager felt cornered since the coworker was protected by the owner's daughter. Still, the right approach would have been to address the issue through proper channels, perhaps with more direct communication or involving management appropriately. \n\nSo, even though the outcome was positive, the means used were unethical. Therefore, the manager is in the wrong.\n"
