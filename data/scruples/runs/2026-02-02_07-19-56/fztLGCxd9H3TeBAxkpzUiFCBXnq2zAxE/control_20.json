She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the fake review is in the wrong. The situation is that their coworker was lazy and unresponsive to feedback. The coworker had a lot of issues like not greeting customers, texting during shifts, and getting customer complaints. The manager couldn't fire her because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out the coworker was self-conscious about reviews, so they wrote a fake one. The coworker changed her behavior after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Writing a fake review to manipulate someone's behavior is deceptive. Even if the intention was good\u2014to make her improve\u2014deception is usually considered wrong. But there's context: the coworker wasn't being fired despite her poor performance, and others had failed to help her improve. The author's alternative was talking to her again, but maybe they felt that approach had already been tried without success.\n\nOn one hand, the author used a private method (fake review) that isn't honest or transparent. On the other, the coworker improved, so maybe the outcome was positive. But the means were underhanded. Also, the coworker's privacy was invaded by the review, which could be seen as a violation. The author might have overstepped by using fear and her insecurities. However, given the lack of other options and the positive result, there's a gray area. But ethically, the action was deceitful and could have been avoided with direct communication. So the author is probably in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
