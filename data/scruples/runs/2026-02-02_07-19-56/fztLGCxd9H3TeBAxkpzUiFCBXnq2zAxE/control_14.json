She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the manager who wrote a fake review is in the wrong. The situation is about a lazy coworker who wasn't being fired because she's friends with the owner's daughter. The manager found out she reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review to push her to improve. She changed her behavior, and now the manager feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The manager's intention was to improve the coworker's work ethic, which might seem good, but the method was deceptive. Writing a fake review is a form of manipulation. The coworker didn't get a real chance to respond or address the issues through proper channels. The manager bypassed formal processes, which could be seen as underhanded.\n\nAlso, even though the coworker improved, the method used could have been harmful. The coworker might have felt humiliated, and the manager's actions could have violated trust. The coworker might not know who did it, leading to a toxic work environment if discovered. Additionally, the manager could be at fault for not following proper procedures, like escalating the issue to management or HR, instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nBut there's a counterpoint: the manager tried talking to her without success. Since she's protected by her friendship with the owner's daughter, firing her wasn't an option. The manager might have felt cornered and used the fake review as the only solution. However, even in such cases, the right approach would involve official channels. The manager's action, while effective, was ethically questionable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the act of deception and potential harassment through fake reviews is generally considered wrong, regardless of the outcome. The manager's guilt suggests they recognize this. So, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
