She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a manager at a small business. Their coworker was really underperforming\u2014lazy, not greeting customers, texting, getting complaints. The owner's daughter is friends with this coworker, so she wasn't fired. The author found out that the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review describing her appearance and the bad service. After the review, the coworker changed her look and improved her work ethic. Now, the author feels guilty and wonders if they could have just talked to her instead.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let me think about the key points here. The author used deception\u2014fake review. They manipulated the coworker's perception by using her insecurities. Even though the outcome was positive (coworker improved), the method was underhanded. \n\nEthically, writing a fake review is dishonest. It's a form of deception. Even if the intent was good (to improve work performance), the means were questionable. The coworker had the right to be addressed directly and given feedback in a professional manner. The author bypassed that by using a trick, which could be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nMoreover, the coworker might have felt betrayed if she found out. The author's action could have caused unnecessary stress or anxiety. Also, considering they work in the same place, this might have created a hostile work environment if the coworker found out it was the author's doing. But the coworker didn't know, right? The author mentions she didn't confront them, but maybe if she realized, there could be issues.\n\nThe author also mentions that previous attempts to talk to her didn't work. However, they didn't try again after the fake review. Maybe a different approach could have worked. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the deception was wrong.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, the proper channel would be to discuss performance issues directly, possibly with management's help. The author took matters into their own hands, which might not be appropriate. The fact that the owner's daughter is friends with the coworker might explain why the owner didn't act, but the author still had a responsibility to handle it professionally.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author used a deceptive method to influence a coworker's behavior, which is ethically wrong despite the positive outcome. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
