She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author is a manager at a small family business. Their coworker was really lazy, didn't perform well, and despite attempts by others to improve her behavior, she didn't change. The coworker is friends with the owner's daughter, so she wasn't fired. The author found out that the coworker checks customer reviews and is self-conscious. So, they wrote a fake review criticizing her, which led to her changing her behavior significantly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the options. Answer A is yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer B is no, they're not.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author resorted to deception by writing a fake review. While the coworker did improve, the method was underhanded. Ethically, using a fake review to manipulate someone is questionable. The author had tried talking to her before, but maybe not enough, or maybe they tried but it didn't work. However, even if the coworker had a bad work ethic, the method of using a fake review crosses a line. It's a form of harassment or bullying, even if the outcome was positive.\n\nAlso, the author is in a position of authority. As a manager, they should address issues through proper channels, like direct communication, training, or involving HR. Writing a fake review is a covert and unethical action. Even if the coworker's behavior was bad, the author's action could be seen as a breach of trust and could have legal implications if the coworker found out and took action.\n\nHowever, the coworker did improve, so maybe the author's intent was good. But the means justify the ends? Probably not. The author could have faced potential consequences if the fake review was discovered, like being reprimanded or even fired. Also, considering the coworker's mental health\u2014being self-conscious and then receiving a negative review might have caused unnecessary stress or anxiety.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might have been aware of her behavior but didn't care, and the review acted as a wake-up call. But again, the method is still unethical. The author's guilt suggests they know they did something wrong, even if the outcome was positive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were ethically wrong. The correct answer would be A.\n"
