She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for writing a fake review to motivate their coworker to improve. The story's context is that the coworker was lazy, had poor work ethic, and despite multiple attempts by others to correct her, she didn't improve. The author discovered that the coworker read reviews and was self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review. This led the coworker to change her behavior, but the author now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author used deception by creating a fake review, which is dishonest. Even if the intent was good (to improve the coworker's performance), the method involved lying and potentially causing emotional distress. Deception is generally considered wrong, regardless of the outcome, because it undermines trust and can have unintended consequences.\n\nThen, there's the question of the coworker's rights. The coworker might not have been aware that the review was fake, so she was manipulated into changing her behavior without her consent. This could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation, which is ethically problematic. Even if the coworker improved, the means used to achieve that improvement are questionable.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace dynamics. The author, as a manager, might have a responsibility to address performance issues through proper channels, such as formal evaluations, training, or disciplinary actions. Bypassing these processes by using a fake review undermines the established systems and could set a bad precedent. It might also create a hostile work environment if other employees learn about the tactic, leading to distrust.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the author had good intentions. The coworker's poor performance was affecting others, and all previous attempts to correct her failed. The owner's daughter's friendship protected her from being fired, so the author might have felt they had no other options. In this context, the author's actions could be seen as a desperate attempt to maintain a functional work environment.\n\nBut even with good intentions, the method was inappropriate. Ethically, the right approach would be to use legitimate methods, even if they are less effective. The end does not justify the means in this case because the deception and manipulation involved are harmful. The author should have continued to work through proper channels, perhaps escalating the issue to higher management or HR if available, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAdditionally, the coworker's reaction\u2014changing her appearance and improving her work ethic\u2014might be a positive outcome, but it's unclear whether this improvement is sustainable or if it's driven by fear rather than genuine commitment. The review could have caused unnecessary stress or public humiliation, which is another ethical concern.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions were to improve the coworker's behavior, the use of deception and manipulation is ethically wrong. Proper workplace procedures should be followed, and personal actions that bypass these procedures, even with good intentions, are not justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
