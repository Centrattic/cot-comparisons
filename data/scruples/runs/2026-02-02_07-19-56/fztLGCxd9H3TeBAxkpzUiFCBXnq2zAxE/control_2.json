She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The coworker was lazy, had bad work habits, and the author tried talking to her but it didn't work. The coworker was protected because she was the owner's daughter's friend. So the author couldn't get her fired easily. They found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review to shock her into improving. It worked; she changed her behavior.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here. The author used a deceptive method to achieve a positive outcome. But is deception justified here? On one hand, the coworker improved, which benefits everyone. On the other hand, the author lied, which is dishonest. Also, there's potential for harm if the coworker had reacted negatively instead of positively. The author didn't give the coworker a chance to respond or defend herself, which could lead to unfair treatment.\n\nLegally, fake reviews can be problematic. They might violate terms of service on review platforms and could be considered defamatory if they damage someone's reputation. Even if it was in good faith, the method is questionable.\n\nEthically, while the outcome was good, the means used were underhanded. The author didn't have the right to impersonate a customer and spread false information. The coworker's rights to due process were ignored. Instead of a fake review, maybe a more direct approach, like reporting to management or using formal channels, would have been better, even if it was less effective.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they used deception and potentially violated policies, even if the result was positive. The ends don't justify the means in this case. The correct answer should be A.\n"
