She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author wrote a fake customer review to motivate their coworker to improve her work ethic. The coworker was lazy, got complaints, but hadn't been fired because she's friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake one. The coworker then changed her behavior, but the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The main issue is the method used. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. Even if the outcome was positive, the means involved lying. The coworker didn't know it was fake and might have been hurt by it. Also, the author didn't take the proper channels to address the problem, like talking directly or involving management. Instead, they used a personal vendetta-style approach.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm. Even though the coworker improved, someone else reading the fake review could have taken it seriously, leading to misunderstandings or even real consequences for the coworker. Plus, the author's actions could backfire if discovered, leading to their own disciplinary action.\n\nHowever, the coworker did improve, and the author's intention was to help. But the right approach would have been to communicate openly, not deceive. The author should have reported the coworker's behavior through proper channels instead of taking matters into their own hands. So, while the outcome was good, the method was wrong.\n"
