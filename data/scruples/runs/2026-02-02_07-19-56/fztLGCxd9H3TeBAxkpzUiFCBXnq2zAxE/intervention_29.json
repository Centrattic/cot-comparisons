She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation involves a coworker who was underperforming, and the author resorted to deception by creating a fake review to shame her into improving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. Even though the outcome was positive\u2014improved work ethic\u2014the method used was underhanded. The coworker didn't have a chance to respond or defend herself, which could be seen as unfair. The author didn't use proper channels like direct communication or HR, which are standard in workplace issues. \n\nThe coworker's behavior was indeed problematic, and the fact that she was protected because of her friendship with the owner's daughter adds context. However, that doesn't justify the author's actions. The author could have escalated the issue properly, maybe by involving the owner or HR, rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nThe guilt the author feels might be a sign that they recognize the ethical dilemma here. Even if the fake review worked, the method was manipulative. There's also the risk of backlash if the coworker found out it was fake, which could lead to a hostile work environment or legal issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to improve the coworker's performance and the overall work environment. But intentions don't necessarily absolve the action. The means used were unethical regardless of the outcome. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they used a deceptive and unethical method to address a workplace issue that should have been handled through proper channels.\n"
