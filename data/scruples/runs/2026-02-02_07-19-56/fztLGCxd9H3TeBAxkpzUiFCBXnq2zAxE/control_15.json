She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story did the wrong thing by writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker was lazy, unresponsive to feedback, and had a negative impact on the workplace. The author tried to address it by talking to her, but it didn't work. Since she's friends with the owner's daughter, she wasn't fired despite her poor performance.\n\nThe author's solution was to exploit the coworker's self-consciousness by writing a fake negative review. This led the coworker to change her behavior, cutting piercings, changing her hair, and improving her work ethic. The author now feels guilty and wonders if talking to her directly was a better option.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, writing a fake review is a problem because it's deceptive. It's a form of fraud or defamation if the review is false. Even if the intent was to help, the action is unethical. \n\nEthically, manipulating someone by creating a fake review is underhanded. The coworker didn't get a fair chance to respond or defend herself. The author bypassed proper channels (like management or HR) to address the issue, which could lead to trust issues in the workplace. \n\nHowever, the coworker did improve, which might be seen as a positive outcome. But the means to achieve that improvement are questionable. The author should have possibly escalated the issue through official channels instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nIn summary, while the coworker's behavior was problematic, the author's method of addressing it was unethical and potentially illegal. The correct approach would have been to involve management or HR, as the author couldn't take action due to the coworker's connection. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
