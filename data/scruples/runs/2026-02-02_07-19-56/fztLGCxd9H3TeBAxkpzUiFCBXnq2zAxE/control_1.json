She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the manager who wrote a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the scenario: The coworker was very lazy, had bad work habits, and wasn't responding to feedback. The manager wrote a fake negative review, knowing the coworker checks reviews and is self-conscious. The coworker improved after seeing the review. Now the manager feels guilty because maybe they could have talked to her instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are the methods used. Writing a fake review to manipulate someone isn't exactly ethical. Even though the outcome was positive (the coworker improved), the means were deceptive. The manager used a form of deception to provoke a change, which might be seen as underhanded. \n\nBut then again, the coworker was protected because she was friends with the owner's daughter, so the manager couldn't get her fired. The manager tried talking to her before, but it didn't work. The fake review was a last resort to make her improve. Some might argue that the manager had no other options and the end justified the means. However, others would say that deception is never acceptable, regardless of the outcome.\n\nAlso, the coworker was put in a vulnerable position. She might have felt humiliated, even if she improved. The manager's action could have affected her self-esteem negatively. Plus, if the coworker found out the review was fake, it could lead to trust issues or even retaliation.\n\nOn the other hand, the manager's intention was to improve the work environment and customer service. Without the ability to fire her, they had to find a way to make her change. The fake review worked, and the coworker became a model employee. \n\nThe ethical dilemma here is about the method versus the outcome. In some contexts, like a small business, maybe such tactics are more understandable. But in general, using deception, even for good reasons, can be considered wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the manager did something unethical by fabricating a review. Even if the outcome was positive, the method was deceptive and could have caused harm. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
