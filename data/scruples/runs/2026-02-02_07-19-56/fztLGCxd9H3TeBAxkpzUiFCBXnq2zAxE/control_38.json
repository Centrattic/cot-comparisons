She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the fake review is in the wrong. The situation is that the coworker was really lazy and not performing, leading to customer complaints. The author decided to write a fake negative review, which they knew the coworker would see because she was self-conscious about her image. The result was that the coworker changed her behavior for the better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical aspects. Writing a fake review is deceptive because it's not an honest customer's opinion. It's a lie, even if the intention was good. Deception is generally considered wrong because it undermines trust. The author used manipulation by exploiting the coworker's self-consciousness, which is a personal flaw. That could be seen as taking advantage of someone's insecurities, which is unethical.\n\nThen there's the legal angle. Fake reviews can be illegal in some jurisdictions because they mislead consumers and can be considered fraud. Even if the coworker was the intended target, the review was posted publicly, which might have affected the business's reputation and customer trust. So legally, it's a problematic action.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker had a bad work ethic, and the author tried to help through normal channels (talking to her, retraining). Since she was protected by being friends with the owner's daughter, traditional methods failed. The author's goal was to improve the coworker's performance, which did happen. But the means used were unethical and potentially illegal.\n\nThe outcome was positive, but the method was questionable. The author should have considered other options, like reporting the issue to management more formally, even if the coworker was protected. Alternatively, maybe confronting the coworker directly with feedback, even if it was difficult. The fake review was a form of bullying or psychological manipulation, which isn't acceptable in a workplace.\n\nSo, even though the result was good, the action taken was wrong. The author violated ethical standards and possibly legal ones. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
