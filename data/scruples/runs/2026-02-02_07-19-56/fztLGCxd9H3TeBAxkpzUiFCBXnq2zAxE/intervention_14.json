She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. The situation involves a coworker who was being lazy and unresponsive to feedback. The author resorted to writing a fake customer review, knowing the coworker checks reviews and is self-conscious. The coworker changed her behavior after seeing the review.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the action. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. Even if the intention was good\u2014trying to help the coworker improve\u2014it's still not honest. The author didn't address the issue directly, which might have been the more appropriate method. Instead, they used a manipulative tactic, which could be seen as violating trust in the workplace.\n\nAlso, the coworker's actions were problematic, but the author's solution might have been unnecessary. The coworker had already been retrained multiple times without success. The author could have escalated the issue to a higher authority or perhaps tried a different approach, like more structured feedback or involving HR if available. However, in a small family-owned business, HR might not be an option, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle is the consequence. The coworker improved, so there's a positive outcome. But the method used was underhanded. The author felt guilty afterward, which suggests they recognize that something was off about their actions. Guilt often indicates that the action, while possibly well-intentioned, crossed an ethical line.\n\nThe coworker was protected due to being friends with the owner's daughter, so the author couldn't fire her. That might have led to feeling desperate for a solution. However, using a fake review is still a breach of ethical workplace conduct. There are other ways to handle the situation without deception.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome was positive, the method used was unethical. The author had the intention to help but chose an improper means. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
