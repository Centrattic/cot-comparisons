She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the fake review is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person is a manager at a small family-owned restaurant. Their coworker was really lazy, didn't greet customers, texted during shifts, got complaints, and they couldn't get fired because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The manager found out that this coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review specifically targeting her, describing her distinctive appearance. A week later, the coworker changed her look and improved her work ethic. Now the manager feels guilty, wondering if they should have just talked to her instead.\n\nFirst, let's think about the actions taken. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. The manager used a manipulative tactic by exploiting the coworker's insecurities. Even though the end result was positive (the coworker improved), the method was underhanded. \n\nBut then, the coworker wasn't responding to previous attempts to correct her behavior. The manager and others tried retraining and talking to her, but nothing worked. The fake review might have been the only thing that motivated change. However, the ethical aspect is about the means used. \n\nIs it wrong to manipulate someone's self-perception to change their behavior? The coworker was aware of the review and felt the need to change. But the manager didn't confront her directly; instead, they used a third-party method. This could be seen as a breach of trust, especially in a workplace where honest communication is expected. \n\nAlso, the fake review could have other consequences. What if the coworker had reacted negatively, or if the owner had found out about the review? The manager's actions could damage the business's reputation if discovered. Plus, the coworker might have felt betrayed by the manager's deception rather than understanding the feedback.\n\nOn the other hand, the manager's intention was to improve the coworker's performance for the good of the team and the business. They might not have had the authority to take more formal disciplinary actions since the owner was hesitant to let go of the friend's friend. \n\nBut in a professional setting, employees should be given direct feedback. Using a fake review is a circumvention of proper channels. It's possible the coworker might have taken the review more seriously because she knew it was real, but the manager's approach lacks transparency. Even if the outcome was positive, the method raises ethical concerns.\n\nSo, the manager's actions were manipulative and potentially unethical, even if the result was good. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
