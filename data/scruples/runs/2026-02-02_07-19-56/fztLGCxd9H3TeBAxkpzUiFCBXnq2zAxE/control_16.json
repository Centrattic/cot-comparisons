She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a manager at a small family-owned business. Their coworker was very lazy, had poor work habits, and caused customer complaints. The coworker wasn't fired because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out that the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review to push her to change. The coworker did improve after the review, changing her appearance and work ethic. Now the author feels guilty and wonders if talking to her directly would have been better.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were wrong. Let's consider ethical angles. The author used deception by posting a fake review, which is a form of lying. The coworker was harmed because the review was false, but it led to positive change. However, the coworker didn't consent to this method. The author also considered the coworker's feelings by using her self-consciousness, which might be manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker was harming the business with her behavior, and the owner didn't take action. The author tried to address the problem through the only means they could think of. But is deception justified here? Even if the outcome is good, the method is questionable. \n\nAlso, the author didn't confront the coworker directly. Maybe a conversation could have worked. The author's guilt suggests they see the ethical issue. \n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, manipulating someone through fake reviews is not a standard practice. It could lead to legal issues if discovered, as fake reviews are illegal in some places. The coworker's rights and well-being might be compromised. \n\nSo, while the outcome was positive, the means used were unethical and potentially harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
