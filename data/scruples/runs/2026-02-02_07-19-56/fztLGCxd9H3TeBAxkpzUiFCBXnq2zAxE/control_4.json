She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person wrote a fake review to make their coworker improve, and it worked. But the question is whether they were wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, the coworker was lazy, causing issues, but wasn't fired because of a personal connection. The author tried other methods like talking to her, but nothing worked. They used the fake review as a last resort, exploiting the coworker's self-consciousness about reviews. The result was positive\u2014coworker improved. But was the method ethical?\n\nWriting a fake review is a form of deception. It's not honest feedback, and it's manipulative. Even if the intention was good, the method involved lying. The author didn't confront the coworker directly, which might have been the right approach. However, the employer didn't take action because of the owner's daughter. So the author felt they had no other options. \n\nBut is deception ever justified? Even if it leads to a good outcome, it's still a lie. The coworker didn't get a fair chance to respond or address the review since it was fake. Also, the author could have escalated the issue to the owner more strongly, even if it's a personal connection. Maybe there's a middle ground between writing a fake review and just doing nothing. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker improved, so the action had a positive effect. The author might feel guilty because they used underhanded tactics. But others might argue that the ends justify the means here. However, ethically, using deception is generally considered wrong, regardless of the outcome. So the author is in the wrong for writing the fake review.\n"
