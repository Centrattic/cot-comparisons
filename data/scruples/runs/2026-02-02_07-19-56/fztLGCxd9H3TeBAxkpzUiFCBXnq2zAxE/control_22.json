She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review about their coworker. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nThe person is a manager at a small family-owned restaurant. They had a coworker who was really lazy, didn't greet customers, texted during work, got complaints, but wasn't fired because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out that this coworker checks customer reviews and is self-conscious. So, they wrote a fake negative review pointing out her by her appearance, which caused her to change her behavior. Now the author feels guilty and wonders if they should have just talked to her instead.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether writing a fake review was the right approach. Let's break down possible angles. \n\nFirst, the coworker was a problem. The owner didn't want to fire her, so the manager had to find another way to improve her performance. The fake review worked, but was it ethical? \n\nOn one hand, the author used deception (fake review) to achieve a positive outcome. The coworker improved, which is good. But on the other hand, the method was underhanded. The coworker might have felt humiliated or tricked. Also, the author used personal information (hair color, piercings) to identify her, which could be seen as invading her privacy. \n\nThe author didn't confront her directly, which could have been a more honest approach. Instead, they manipulated the situation through a fake review. Even though the result was positive, the means were dishonest. \n\nAlso, consider the coworker's reaction. She changed her appearance and work habits because she felt pressured by the review. That's a result of fear or shame, which might not lead to genuine change in the long term. Maybe talking to her would have been more respectful and sustainable. \n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility as a manager. They should have tried all possible legitimate methods before resorting to a fake review. Since others had already tried talking to her without success, the author might have felt desperate. But as a manager, they should model ethical behavior even when others don't. \n\nLegally, fake reviews are a problem because they mislead customers and businesses. Even if the intention was to help someone, it's still unethical and could have legal implications if discovered. \n\nSo, putting this together, even though the outcome was good, the method was unethical. The author used manipulation and deception, which are wrong regardless of the result. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
