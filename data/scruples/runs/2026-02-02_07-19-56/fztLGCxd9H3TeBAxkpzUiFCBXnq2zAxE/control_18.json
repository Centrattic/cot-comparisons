She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the fake review is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is a manager at a small family-owned restaurant. They had a coworker who was lazy and difficult to work with. Despite colleagues and the boss trying to help her improve, she didn't change. The coworker was close to the owner's daughter, so she wasn't fired. The author found out that this coworker read reviews and was self-conscious. So, they wrote a fake negative review that described her in a bad light, making sure to highlight her poor service. After the review, the coworker changed her behavior, got a better haircut, fewer piercings, and started working hard. The author feels guilty now, wondering if they could have talked to her instead.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions and the consequences. The fake review was a deceptive act. It's not straightforward to know if that's right or wrong. The coworker improved, which is a positive outcome. But the method was underhanded. \n\nEthically, manipulating someone through deception, even for a good outcome, might be questionable. The author didn't confront the coworker directly, which could be seen as cowardice. However, they tried talking before and it didn't work. The coworker improved, so maybe the end justifies the means here. But maybe not, because the method was dishonest.\n\nAlso, the restaurant's policy: if they have a system for feedback, the author might have circumvented that. But in a small business, maybe there's no formal policy, so the manager had to take unconventional steps.\n\nAnother angle: did the author harm the coworker's reputation? The fake review could have damaged her reputation if others saw it. Although the coworker didn't lose her job, maybe she felt embarrassed or stressed. The author's actions might have crossed a line by using a fake review to manipulate her behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have tried all possible direct methods first. Since others had tried talking already and it didn't work, the author might have felt desperate. But the right approach might have been to escalate the issue to the owner, even though the coworker was the owner's daughter's friend. Maybe the owner was unaware of the extent of the problem. \n\nThe guilt the author feels suggests they recognize the ethical dilemma. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether deception is acceptable to achieve a positive outcome. Some might argue that the ends justify the means, others might say the method was unethical regardless.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they used deception and manipulation instead of direct communication. Even though the outcome was good, the method was dishonest and could have been harmful in other ways. However, given the coworker's resistance to change and the lack of formal systems, some might say the author wasn't in the wrong (B). It's a tough call. But generally, unethical methods are frowned upon even if the result is positive. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
