She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this scenario. The user is a manager at a small business and had a problematic coworker who wasn't performing well. The coworker was lazy, ignored customers, and had multiple complaints. The owner's daughter is friends with her, so she wasn't fired despite her poor performance. The manager found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review to shame her into improving. It worked; the coworker changed her behavior, but the manager is now feeling guilty about using that method instead of trying to talk to her again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the manager did something wrong. The key points here are the intent versus the method. The manager's goal was to improve the coworker's performance, which is understandable, especially when previous attempts failed. However, the method used was deceptive\u2014creating a fake review. \n\nWriting a fake review is a form of deception and could be considered unethical. It also invades the coworker's privacy in a sense, even if the manager thought the coworker was self-conscious about reviews. The coworker didn't have a chance to respond or defend herself, which could have led to misunderstandings or unnecessary stress. \n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. While the coworker improved, using a fake review might set a precedent where others might feel the need to retaliate or where the company could face legal issues if the owner finds out. Also, the manager didn't directly address the issue through proper channels, like formal performance reviews or involving the owner appropriately. Instead, they took a personal, behind-the-scenes approach.\n\nThe manager's guilt suggests they recognize that the method was questionable. The question is whether the end justifies the means. Even if the outcome was positive, the method used was inappropriate. Ethically, manipulating someone's perception to change behavior without their consent is problematic. It undermines trust and could damage the manager's professional integrity.\n\nHowever, the manager did so out of a desire to help the coworker improve and fix a problem that others couldn't. In a small business with a close-knit team, maybe the manager felt they had limited options. Still, the right approach would have been to escalate the issue properly, perhaps by documenting the coworker's performance issues and discussing them with the owner, even if the owner is biased towards the coworker.\n\nIn summary, while the manager's intentions were good and the outcome was positive, the method of using a fake review crosses ethical lines. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the action was deceptive and bypassed proper channels, even if the result was beneficial.\n"
