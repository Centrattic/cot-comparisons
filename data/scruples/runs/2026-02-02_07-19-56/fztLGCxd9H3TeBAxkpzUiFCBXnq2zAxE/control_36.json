She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did something wrong by writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. \n\nFirst, the coworker was lazy, didn't follow procedures, and the team had tried to address it but failed. The author found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review to shock her into improving. The result was that the coworker changed her behavior for the better.\n\nNow, considering ethics and workplace conduct. Writing a fake review is deceptive. Even if the intention was good\u2014to help someone improve\u2014the method involved lying. The coworker didn't have a chance to respond to the false accusations, and the author didn't address the issues directly. \n\nIn a professional setting, it's important to handle issues through proper channels: feedback, training, and possibly disciplinary actions. The author's approach bypassed these steps, which could be seen as underhanded. Even though the outcome was positive, the means were ethically questionable. \n\nAlso, the coworker might feel betrayed if she found out the truth. The author's guilt suggests they recognize this. The alternative\u2014talking to her directly\u2014was not pursued, which is the standard approach for conflict resolution. \n\nSo, even though the coworker improved, using a fake review was a dishonest method. The author manipulated the situation rather than dealing with it through appropriate channels. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
