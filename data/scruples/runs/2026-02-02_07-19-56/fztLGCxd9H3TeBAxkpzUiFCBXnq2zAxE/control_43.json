She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote a fake review of their coworker is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who was lazy, unresponsive to feedback, and had a poor work ethic. The manager wrote a fake negative review to push the coworker to improve, which worked, but now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Writing a fake review is deceptive because it's not a genuine customer's opinion. It's a form of manipulation. Even though the coworker improved, the method used was dishonest. The coworker might feel betrayed if they found out, even if the outcome was positive.\n\nAlso, the coworker's improvement was a result of fear of more negative reviews rather than genuine change. The manager didn't address the root issues directly. Instead of using proper channels like formal reprimands or additional training, they used an underhanded tactic. This could set a bad precedent and erode trust in the workplace.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker was difficult to manage, and the manager tried other methods without success. The owner's influence made firing her impossible. The manager's intention was to help improve the coworker's performance for the good of the business. However, the means justified the ends here? Probably not. The correct approach would have been to escalate the issue properly or seek a different solution through management rather than creating a fake review.\n\nSo, while the outcome was positive, the method was unethical. The manager is in the wrong because they used deception and manipulation instead of appropriate managerial strategies. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes).\n"
