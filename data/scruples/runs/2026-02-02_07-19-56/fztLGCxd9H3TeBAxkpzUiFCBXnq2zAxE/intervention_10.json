She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote a fake review of their coworker is in the wrong. The scenario is that the coworker was lazy, hard to manage, and had a bad work ethic, but couldn't be fired because she's friends with the owner's daughter. The manager wrote a fake negative review targeting her, which led to the coworker changing her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical implications. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. Even if the intention was to help the coworker improve, the method was manipulative. The coworker was self-conscious about reviews, so the review acted as a catalyst for change, but that doesn't necessarily justify the deception. \n\nLegally, fake reviews can be considered fraud or a violation of terms of service for the review platform. Ethically, it's about respecting others' privacy and autonomy. The coworker wasn't given a direct chance to address the issues through proper channels. Instead, the manager used a backhanded method, which might have caused unnecessary stress or harm. \n\nThe manager could have tried other approaches, like a more direct conversation, involving HR, or perhaps discussing with the owner. The fact that the coworker improved is a positive outcome, but the means to get there might still be problematic. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. If the coworker found out the review was fake, it could damage workplace relationships and trust. The manager's actions might be seen as underhanded, which could have long-term negative effects on the work environment. \n\nHowever, the manager's intention was to help, not to harm. The coworker did improve, and maybe the fake review was the only effective method given the circumstances. But intentions don't always excuse the means. The question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, deception is generally frowned upon unless it's to prevent serious harm, which might not be the case here. The manager's actions could be considered a breach of ethical standards in the workplace. \n\nSo, while the outcome was positive, the method used was ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
