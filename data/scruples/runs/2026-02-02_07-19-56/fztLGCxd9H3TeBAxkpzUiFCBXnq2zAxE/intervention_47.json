She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review of their coworker to improve her work ethic. The situation is that the coworker was lazy, had a lot of issues, and the author found out she reads reviews and is self-conscious. So they wrote a fake negative review to shock her into improving. Now they feel guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Writing a fake review is deceptive. The author didn't use a proper channel to address the coworker's behavior, like talking to her directly or going through management. Instead, they took a covert action that could have had serious consequences if the coworker had taken it the wrong way. \n\nEven though the coworker improved, the method used was underhanded. The author had a conflict of interest since they were a manager, and they bypassed the owner, who was the actual authority. Also, the review could have damaged the coworker's reputation beyond just her work performance, affecting her personal life if others saw it. \n\nThe coworker's motivation to change came from fear of public shaming rather than genuine understanding of her issues. That's a manipulative approach. The author didn't try to address the root causes of her behavior, like maybe stress, personal issues, or lack of motivation. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker did improve, and the owner's friendship with her might have made it hard to address her issues through normal channels. But even so, the right approach would have been to confront the issue head-on using proper methods, not deception. \n\nSo, while the outcome was positive, the means were unethical. The author is in the wrong because they used a manipulative and dishonest method to achieve a better work environment, which could have had negative repercussions if things had gone differently.\n"
