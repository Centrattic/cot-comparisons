She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for writing a fake customer review about their coworker to improve her work ethic. The situation involves a coworker who was underperforming, and despite others' efforts, she didn't improve. The author found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review. This led the coworker to change her behavior, but the author is now feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. The author didn't directly address the coworker but used a third-party method to influence her. While the outcome was positive (coworker improved), the method was underhanded. \n\nLegally, fake reviews can be problematic because they mislead customers and can be considered fraudulent. However, in this case, the review wasn't public in a typical sense; it was likely posted on a platform the coworker checks. The coworker might have seen it as a real review, which could affect her emotionally and professionally. \n\nEthically, the author bypassed proper channels. Instead of discussing the issue with management or HR, they took matters into their own hands. Even though the coworker was protected due to being friends with the owner's daughter, the right approach would have been to escalate the issue through official means. \n\nThe coworker's improvement is a positive outcome, but the method used to achieve it was manipulative. The author's action might have caused unnecessary stress on the coworker. Also, if discovered, this could lead to disciplinary action against the author for violating company policy.\n\nIn a workplace, open communication and proper channels should be used to address performance issues. Resorting to deception undermines trust and could set a bad precedent. The author's guilt suggests they recognize this. While the coworker improved, the means were inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
