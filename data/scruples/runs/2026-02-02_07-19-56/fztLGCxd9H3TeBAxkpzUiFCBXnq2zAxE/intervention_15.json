She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person wrote a fake review to make their coworker improve. The coworker was really lazy and had a lot of problems, but the owner didn't want to fire her because she's friends with the owner's daughter. The writer found out that the coworker checks reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake bad review specifically targeting her. The coworker changed her behavior after that, but the writer is now feeling guilty.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. On one hand, the coworker improved, which is a good outcome. The writer might have done this out of frustration because others had already tried to help but failed. But on the other hand, writing a fake review is deceptive. It's lying, which could be considered unethical. Also, the coworker might not have known it was fake, so she was misled. Even if the intention was good, the method is questionable. The writer didn't address the issue directly, which could have been more appropriate. Maybe confronting the coworker or going through proper channels would have been better. Plus, the fake review could have caused unnecessary stress or damage to the coworker's reputation. Even though the outcome was positive, the means used were underhanded. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
