She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review about their coworker to improve her work ethic. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the coworker was described as very lazy, had poor work habits, and despite efforts from others, she didn't improve. The author found out she read reviews and was self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review that specifically targeted her. The result was that the coworker changed her behavior significantly. Now the author feels guilty and wonders if they should have tried talking to her again instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the method used was deceptive (fake review), the intended purpose was to improve her performance, and it worked. But was it ethical?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, using deception, even with good intentions, can be problematic. The author didn't address the issue directly or through proper channels. Instead, they took a covert action that could have violated the coworker's privacy and trust. Even though the outcome was positive, the means might be considered wrong. \n\nAdditionally, writing a fake review is a form of manipulation. It could be seen as an invasion of the coworker's personal space and self-esteem. The coworker might have felt betrayed if she found out it was fake. Also, the author might have crossed a line by using personal information (like appearance) to target her specifically, which could be seen as harassment or bullying.\n\nHowever, the situation is tricky because the coworker wasn't being addressed properly through management. Since the owner's daughter was friends with her, maybe the management wasn't taking action. The author tried other methods before this, but they didn't work. So, in a way, the author was trying to help improve the workplace environment. But the method was questionable.\n\nLegally, fake reviews could also be an issue if they defamed the coworker. But the question is more about moral wrongdoing rather than legal. Ethically, even if it worked, the author used underhanded tactics. They should have perhaps escalated the issue more formally or found a different way to address the coworker's behavior without deception.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome was positive, the method used was unethical. The author is in the wrong because they resorted to manipulation instead of direct and honest communication.\n"
