She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review of their coworker to improve her work ethic. The scenario is that the coworker was really lazy, had poor customer service, and despite others trying to help, she didn't improve. The author found out the coworker reads reviews and was self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review. The coworker changed her behavior after seeing the review.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author used deception by creating a fake review. Even though the outcome was positive, the method was manipulative. The coworker didn't have a chance to respond or defend herself, which could be unfair. The author's actions might have crossed a line by not addressing the issue directly, as they suggested in the end maybe they should have talked to her instead.\n\nBut then, the coworker was protected because of the owner's daughter's friendship. So the author couldn't fire her, and others had tried to help without success. The fake review led to a positive change. However, using someone's insecurities against them, even for a good cause, is questionable. The coworker might feel betrayed if she found out it was fake, which could lead to other issues in the workplace.\n\nAlso, fake reviews can have legal implications if they damage someone's reputation. The author could face consequences if the coworker discovered the deception and took legal action. Ethically, the author might have violated trust and used manipulative tactics, which could harm workplace relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to improve the coworker's performance for the good of the business. They felt guilty afterward and considered alternative approaches. The outcome was positive, so there's a utilitarian angle where the end justified the means. But in many ethical frameworks, the method matters as much as the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome was good, the method involved deception and manipulation, which are generally considered unethical. The author should have tried direct communication instead of a covert approach. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
