She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to get their coworker to improve. The situation is that the coworker was very lazy and had a lot of issues, but wasn't fired because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review describing her behavior. The coworker changed her appearance and improved her work ethic after seeing the review. Now the author feels guilty and wonders if they should have just talked to her instead.\n\nFirst, consider the action: writing a fake review. Legally, fake reviews can be problematic because they deceive customers and manipulate the system. Ethically, it's about the intent and the method. The author's intent was to help improve the coworker's behavior, which is positive. But the method involved deception and possibly violating the coworker's privacy. The coworker didn't consent to this action, so it's an invasion of her trust. \n\nAlso, the workplace dynamics matter. The author is a manager, which gives them authority, but using a fake review to manipulate a subordinate is underhanded. A proper manager should address issues through direct communication, training, and possibly involving the owner if necessary. Bypassing the proper channels by creating a fake review could lead to a hostile work environment and might be a form of harassment. The coworker changed her appearance significantly, which might indicate stress or coercion, which is not healthy.\n\nHowever, the outcome was positive\u2014the coworker improved. But the means used are questionable. Even if the result is good, the method might still be unethical. The author didn't confront the coworker directly, which could have been a better approach, even if previous attempts failed. Maybe there was a way to address the issue without deception. The fact that the author feels guilty now suggests they recognize the ethical dilemma.\n\nIn summary, while the intention was to improve the coworker's behavior, the method used was deceptive and manipulative, which is ethically wrong. The author should have tried other avenues, even if they felt they had tried before. The answer is A.\n"
