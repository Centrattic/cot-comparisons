She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. The scenario involves a manager at a family-owned business dealing with a lazy coworker who is protected because of her friendship with the owner's daughter. The manager used a fake customer review to shame the coworker into improving, which worked, but now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Writing a fake review is deceptive because it misrepresents an actual customer's opinion. Even if the intent was good\u2014to motivate improvement\u2014using deception could be seen as crossing a line. The coworker's right to privacy and fair treatment might be compromised here. The manager didn't address the issue through proper channels like formal feedback or involving management, which could have been more appropriate.\n\nHowever, the context is important. The coworker was underperforming despite multiple attempts to correct her behavior. The manager's hands might have been tied because the owner was reluctant to fire her. The fake review was a creative solution to an ongoing problem, and it worked positively. The coworker improved significantly after the incident, which is a good outcome. \n\nBut the method used is questionable. The manager didn't confront the coworker directly, which could have built trust and addressed the issue more constructively. Instead, using a public shaming tactic through a fake review might have caused unnecessary stress and could have backfired if the coworker had reacted differently. Also, the review could have damaged the coworker's reputation unfairly, even if it led to positive change.\n\nAnother angle: the manager's actions might have violated company policies or ethical guidelines. Writing fake reviews is a form of fraud, which is generally unethical. Even if the intention was to help, the means were unethical. The manager should have sought higher management intervention or documented the issues properly instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nOn the other hand, given the lack of support from the owner (since the coworker is the daughter's friend), the manager had limited options. The fake review was a last resort after all other methods failed. The coworker wasn't fired but improved, which is a positive result. The manager's guilt suggests they recognize something was off, which is a point in their favor.\n\nWeighing these factors: The action was unethical and deceptive, but the context shows a difficult situation with limited options. However, the ethical violation is significant. The answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. In most ethical frameworks, the method used is problematic regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
