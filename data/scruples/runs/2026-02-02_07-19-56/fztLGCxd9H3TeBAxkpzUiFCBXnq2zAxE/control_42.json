She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the coworker was really lazy, had a bad work ethic, and even got customer complaints. The problem is that she's friends with the owner's daughter, so she wasn't getting fired. The author found out that she reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review targeting her. It worked; she changed her behavior. Now the author feels guilty because maybe they should have just talked to her instead.\n\nHmm. Legally, fake reviews can be a problem. They might violate terms of service on review platforms. Ethically, it's manipulation. The author used someone's insecurity against them. Even if the outcome was positive, the method was deceitful. The coworker was tricked into changing her behavior, which isn't a respectful approach. Also, the author didn't address the issue directly, which could have been the right thing to do, like reporting the behavior through proper channels or having a direct conversation. Instead, they took matters into their own hands, which could cause trust issues. So, even though the coworker improved, the means were wrong. The answer is A.\n"
