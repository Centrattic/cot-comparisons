She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. They want a yes or no answer based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is a manager who had a problematic coworker. The coworker was lazy, didn't greet customers, used her phone, etc. She wasn't fired because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out she read customer reviews and was self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review. The coworker changed her behavior, but the author now feels guilty.\n\nThe key points here are the ethical implications of the author's actions. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. Even if the intention was good (to improve the coworker's performance), using a fake review is a dishonest method. The coworker might have felt violated or manipulated. Also, the author didn't use proper managerial channels, like formal feedback or HR procedures. Instead, they opted for a personal and underhanded approach.\n\nHowever, the context shows that the coworker didn't respond to previous attempts to correct her behavior. The business is family-owned, and the author might have felt constrained in dealing with the coworker due to her connection. The outcome was positive\u2014the coworker improved. But the means used were unethical.\n\nIn professional settings, it's important to address issues through appropriate channels. Using deception, even for a good cause, can lead to trust issues and potential legal problems if discovered. The author should have escalated the issue to higher management or HR rather than taking matters into their own hands. The guilt they feel now is a sign that they recognize the ethical problem.\n\nSo, even though the outcome was positive, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
