She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the person wrote a fake review about their coworker to make her improve her work ethic. The coworker had been a bad employee, but because she was friends with the owner's daughter, she wasn't fired. The author used the coworker's self-consciousness about reviews to their advantage by creating a fake negative review, which led to her changing her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Writing a fake review is deceitful and manipulative. Even though the author's intent was to help the coworker improve, the method was underhanded. The coworker didn't have a chance to respond or defend herself, and the author took advantage of her insecurities. \n\nBut on the other hand, the coworker did change for the better. The author might have felt they had no other options since others had already tried talking to her without success. However, the right approach would have been to confront the issue directly, maybe through formal channels or involving management properly. Instead, the author chose a covert method that could have backfired if the coworker had found out it was fake, leading to trust issues or worse.\n\nAlso, the author didn't consider the potential harm. The fake review could have damaged the coworker's reputation beyond the workplace, affecting her personal life or future jobs. Even though she changed, the means used were unethical. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have escalated the issue to the owner properly instead of taking matters into their own hands. The fact that the coworker improved is a positive outcome, but the method was wrong. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
