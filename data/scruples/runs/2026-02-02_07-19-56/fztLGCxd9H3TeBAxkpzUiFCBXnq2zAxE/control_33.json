She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's performance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker was really underperforming\u2014lazy, not greeting customers, texting, etc. The owner's daughter's friend, so she wasn't fired. The author found out she checks reviews and is self-conscious. So they wrote a fake bad review that described her, leading her to change her behavior.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma. The author used deception by fabricating a review. Even though the outcome was positive (coworker improved), the method was underhanded. Writing a fake review could be considered unethical because it's a form of manipulation. The author didn't confront the coworker directly, which might have been the right step. They took an indirect route that involved lying, which could affect the coworker's reputation falsely. \n\nBut there's context: the coworker wasn't fired despite poor performance, and previous attempts to improve her didn't work. The author felt they had no other options. However, writing a fake review is still a violation of trust and could be seen as a form of harassment or bullying. Even if the intention was good, the method was questionable. The coworker had the right to a fair evaluation of her work, not based on a fake review. \n\nAlso, the author's guilt suggests they recognize the ethical issue. The question is whether the ends justify the means. While the coworker improved, the act of writing a fake review is deceptive and could have legal or workplace policy implications. The proper channel should have been to address the issue through management, not personal manipulation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
