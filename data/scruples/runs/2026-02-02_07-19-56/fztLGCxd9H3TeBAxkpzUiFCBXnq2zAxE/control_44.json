She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake customer review about their coworker. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the coworker is described as lazy and having poor work ethic. The author mentions that the coworker is the owner's daughter's best friend, which is why she hasn't been fired despite her issues. The author learned that the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake review to prompt her to improve. The coworker changed her appearance and improved her work ethic after seeing the review. Now the author feels guilty and is wondering if they should have talked to the coworker instead.\n\nSo, the main points here are: fake review as a means to an end, the coworker's improvement, and the author's guilt. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, writing a fake review is deceptive. It's not a transparent method to address a coworker's behavior. Normally, workplace issues should be handled through proper channels\u2014like talking to the person directly, using formal feedback, or involving management. The author took a more underhanded approach, which could be considered a breach of trust.\n\nHowever, the coworker did improve, and the author's intention was to help. The coworker might not have responded to direct feedback, and the owner's bias (daughter's friend) made firing her difficult. The author might have felt desperate, leading them to take this action.\n\nBut even with good intentions, using deception can have negative consequences. For example, if the coworker finds out the review is fake, it could lead to mistrust, legal issues if the coworker sues for defamation, or a toxic work environment. The author might have crossed a line by manipulating the coworker's insecurities instead of addressing the problem directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker improved, so maybe the outcome was positive. But is the end justifying the means? In many ethical frameworks, the method matters as much as the outcome. The author's action was unethical because it involved lying, even if the result was beneficial.\n\nAlso, the author didn't confront the coworker directly. They chose a passive-aggressive approach, which is not the standard way to handle such situations. Proper conflict resolution would involve direct communication, possibly with the owner's involvement given the coworker's protected status.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help, the method used was deceptive and manipulative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
