She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. \n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker was lazy, uncooperative, and had gotten multiple complaints. The author tried talking to her and others did too, but nothing worked. The coworker was protected because she was friends with the owner's daughter, so she wasn't fired. The author found out the coworker checks reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review. The coworker improved after that.\n\nNow, the question is if the author was wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. Writing a fake review is deceitful. It's a form of manipulation and could be considered unethical or even a privacy violation. The coworker didn't know the review was fake, so the author used fear as a motivator. While the result was positive, the method was underhanded. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker was causing issues, and the employer didn't take action. The author felt responsible and tried to help from a different angle. But even with good intentions, the action was dishonest. The coworker's improvement is a good outcome, but the means to get there might not justify the ends. \n\nLegal perspective: Depending on the location, fake reviews could be illegal, especially if they're damaging someone's reputation. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author might have had no good options, but it's still a questionable choice. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used was unethical and deceptive, even if the outcome was positive. However, some might argue that the author's intentions were good. But in most cases, using deception, even for a good cause, is considered wrong.\n"
