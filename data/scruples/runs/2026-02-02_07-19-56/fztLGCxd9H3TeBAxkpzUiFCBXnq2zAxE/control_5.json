She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who was underperforming, and the author wrote a fake review to shame her into improving. The coworker changed her behavior after reading the fake review.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Writing a fake review is deceptive because it's not truthful. Even if the intent was to help, the method involved lying, which can be seen as manipulative. The coworker might not have known the review was fake, so she was being affected by false information. That raises questions about honesty and integrity.\n\nAlso, the coworker's privacy and dignity come into play. Using someone's personal traits (like appearance) in a fake review could be considered a violation of their privacy. It's a form of public shaming, which can be harmful even if the outcome is positive. The coworker changed because she felt embarrassed, but that method isn't constructive in the long term. It's possible she improved out of fear rather than genuine understanding of her mistakes.\n\nAnother angle is the employer's responsibility. The owner's daughter's friendship with the coworker explains why she wasn't fired, but the author took matters into their own hands. The proper approach would be to follow company protocols or speak with management. Bypassing that by creating a fake review could lead to more problems, like legal issues if discovered, or a toxic work environment if others start using similar tactics.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to improve the coworker's performance, and it worked. The coworker is now a model employee. But intentions don't always justify the means. The author might have caused unnecessary stress and could have used more direct, honest communication instead. Maybe a candid conversation or seeking management's help would have been better.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, there's a line between taking initiative and overstepping. The author's actions might be seen as crossing that line. Public shaming, even subtly, can damage trust and morale. It's important to consider the potential consequences beyond the immediate result. If the coworker finds out the review was fake, it could lead to resentment or conflict.\n\nAlso, legal aspects: fake reviews can be illegal if they defame someone. Depending on the jurisdiction, the coworker could potentially take legal action if she discovers the review was fabricated. That's a risk the author didn't consider.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome was positive, the method used was ethically and possibly legally questionable. The author should have tried other avenues before resorting to deception. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
