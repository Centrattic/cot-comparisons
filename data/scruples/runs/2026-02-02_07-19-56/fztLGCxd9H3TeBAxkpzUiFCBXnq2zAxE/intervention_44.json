She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote a fake review of their coworker is in the wrong. The situation is that the coworker was lazy, not doing her job, and the author decided to write a fake negative review, which led the coworker to change her behavior for the better. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. Writing a fake review is deceptive. Even if the intent was to help the coworker improve, the method was dishonest. The coworker had a right to know that the feedback was from a customer, but since it was fake, she might feel betrayed or manipulated. \n\nAlso, the coworker improved after the incident, which complicates things. The positive outcome is that she became a better employee. However, the means to get there involved lying. Is the end justifying the means? That's a classic ethical dilemma. \n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of the manager. The user is a manager, so they should address poor performance through proper channels. Writing a fake review bypasses those channels and could be seen as a lack of leadership. Instead of creating a fake review, they could have provided direct feedback or escalated the issue to the owner, even though the coworker was the owner's daughter's friend. \n\nThe coworker's reaction to the review\u2014changing her appearance and improving\u2014suggests that the review affected her self-esteem negatively. That's a concern because it could lead to emotional distress. The author might have caused harm, even if unintended, by preying on the coworker's self-consciousness. \n\nBut then again, the coworker didn't improve despite previous attempts. The manager tried talking to her, but it didn't work. So maybe the fake review was the last resort, albeit an unethical one. However, even if it was a last resort, using deception is still wrong. \n\nLegally, writing fake reviews could be considered fraud, but in a personal context, it's more about ethics. The author is now feeling guilty, which indicates some moral conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome was positive, the method was unethical. The author should have used direct communication or involved the owner instead of resorting to a fake review. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
