She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve a coworker's work ethic. Hmm. So the situation is that the coworker was really lazy, and the author found out she reads reviews and is self-conscious. So the author wrote a fake review to shock her into improving. The coworker changed her behavior after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Writing a fake review is definitely deceptive. The author is lying, which is a form of manipulation. Even though the end result was positive\u2014the coworker improved\u2014using deception might not be the right approach. \n\nBut there's also context. The coworker was a problem, and others had tried talking to her without success. The owner's daughter was friends with her, so maybe there was some favoritism. The author might have felt they couldn't get the owner to take action. However, the author's method was underhanded. They used the coworker's insecurities against her, which could be seen as exploiting her for a good outcome. \n\nIs the end justifying the means here? If the coworker improved, maybe the author's intention was good. But the method involved creating a fake review, which is unethical and could have backfired. What if the coworker found out it was fake? Or if the owner discovered it? That could lead to bigger issues like losing trust or even being fired. \n\nAlso, the author is feeling guilty, which suggests they know their actions were morally questionable. They considered talking to the coworker again but chose the fake review instead. So, even though the outcome was positive, the means were wrong. Ethically, lying is generally wrong regardless of the outcome. \n\nAnother angle: the coworker's privacy. The fake review included specific details about her appearance, which could be used to identify her. That's an invasion of privacy. Plus, the review was threatening in a way, saying she should be fired and lose tips. That's not just a criticism; it's an attack.\n\nBut maybe the coworker needed that harsh approach to change. Some people respond better to negative feedback. However, the proper channel would be through management or HR, not a fake customer review. The author bypassed the proper channels, which is problematic.\n\nIn summary, while the coworker's improvement is a good result, the author's method was deceptive, invasive, and unethical. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
