She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for writing a fake review of their coworker to make her improve her work ethic. So, the situation is that the coworker was really lazy, didn't do her job, got complaints, but wasn't fired because she's friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake bad review describing her and how she should be fired. The coworker then changed her appearance and improved her work. Now the author feels guilty and wonders if they should have talked to her instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the action was justified. The coworker was underperforming, and others had tried to help her without success. The author used a fake review as a way to motivate her, which worked. But is that ethical? Writing a fake review is deceptive and could be considered a form of harassment or bullying. It's invading her personal space and using her insecurities against her. Even though the outcome was positive, the method might be problematic. Also, the coworker's appearance changed, which raises questions about privacy and respect. The author didn't have the coworker's consent to do this. In a professional setting, the right approach would usually be to address the performance issues through proper channels, like direct communication, formal feedback, or involving management. Using a fake review is a covert action that bypasses normal procedures, which could lead to legal or ethical issues if discovered. The author's guilt suggests they know it's morally wrong, even if the result was good. So, while the intention was to help, the method was unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
