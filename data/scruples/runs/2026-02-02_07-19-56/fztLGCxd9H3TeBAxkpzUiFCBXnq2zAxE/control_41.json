She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to make their coworker improve. So, first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author is a manager at a small business. Their coworker was lazy, didn't greet customers, was on her phone, got complaints. But she wasn't fired because she's friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out she reads reviews and is self-conscious. So they wrote a fake negative review describing her appearance and bad service. The coworker changed her look and improved her work ethic after that. Now the author feels guilty.\n\nSo the key points here: fake review, deception, manipulation. The author used a fake review as a tactic to change the coworker's behavior. The coworker improved, but was the method unethical?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, writing a fake review is deceptive. It's lying to someone to make them change their behavior. The author didn't directly address the coworker, instead using a backhanded approach. Even though the coworker improved, the method involved lying and possibly violating privacy. The coworker might have felt humiliated if she found out it was fake, even if it worked. Also, the author didn't try to talk to her again before this, which they later consider they should have done. So maybe the author should have tried another communication method first.\n\nBut on the other hand, the coworker was resistant to all previous attempts. The owner didn't fire her, so the author had limited options. The fake review was effective without causing harm beyond the coworker changing her appearance. The question is whether the ends justify the means. However, using deception can lead to mistrust. If the coworker found out, it could damage their relationship and work environment. Also, writing a fake review is unethical in general, regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. The method was deceptive and manipulative, even if the result was positive. Ethically, honesty and direct communication are preferred, even if it's uncomfortable. The author should have found another way to address the issue instead of resorting to a fake review.\n"
