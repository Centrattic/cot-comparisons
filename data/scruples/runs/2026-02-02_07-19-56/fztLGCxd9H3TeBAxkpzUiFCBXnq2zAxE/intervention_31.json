She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the manager who wrote a fake review on their coworker is in the wrong. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: the coworker was really lazy, had a lot of issues, and the manager couldn't fire her because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The manager found out the coworker checks reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a fake negative review to make her improve. It worked, but now they feel guilty because maybe they should have just talked to her instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are the actions taken and the consequences. The manager used deception by fake reviewing someone. That seems unethical. Normally, in a workplace, if an employee is underperforming, the proper channels are to discuss it directly, give feedback, maybe formal warnings. Using a fake review is a bit of a manipulative tactic. It's not addressing the issue directly but trying to shame the coworker through an external method.\n\nBut the coworker did improve. So maybe the outcome was positive. However, the method was underhanded. Even if the result was good, the means of getting there might still be wrong. There's also the question of privacy and respect. The coworker probably didn't know who wrote the review, which could have caused her stress or anxiety. Plus, fake reviews are generally considered unethical and can be illegal in some cases, depending on the platform.\n\nThe manager is feeling guilty, which suggests they themselves think there might be something wrong with their approach. They acknowledge that talking directly might have been better. Even though direct communication didn't work before, maybe there's a way to address the issue without deception. \n\nAnother angle: the manager's role is to manage and support employees. Using a fake review bypasses proper management techniques and could set a bad precedent. If other employees find out, it might create a toxic environment where people are afraid of fake feedback.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker improved, so maybe the manager's intention was good\u2014to help her improve. But the method still seems inappropriate. The right approach would usually involve direct communication, maybe mediation, or involving the owner if the employee's friend is involved. The manager didn't take those steps, which could be why they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because the method was deceptive and unethical, even if the outcome was positive.\n"
