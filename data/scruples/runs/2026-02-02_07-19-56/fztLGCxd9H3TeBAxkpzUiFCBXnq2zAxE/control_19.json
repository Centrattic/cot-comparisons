She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. The situation is a bit complex. The coworker was really lazy, had a bad attitude, and the owner's daughter's friendship made firing her difficult. The author wrote a fake negative review, which led to the coworker changing her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Writing a fake review is deceptive. Even if the intent was good, the method was dishonest. The coworker might have taken the review seriously, thinking it was real, which could cause stress or anxiety. The author used manipulation here, which is a problem.\n\nThen there's the legal aspect. Fake reviews can be considered fraud or defamation if they're harmful and false. Depending on the jurisdiction, this could have legal consequences. The author's actions might have violated company policies too, especially if they didn't go through proper channels to address the coworker's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the outcome was positive. The coworker improved, which is great. The author might have felt they had no other options because previous attempts failed. But that doesn't necessarily justify the method. There are usually other ways to handle such situations, like mediation, formal performance reviews, or involving HR, even if the owner's daughter is involved.\n\nThe author's guilt is also a point. Feeling guilty suggests they know their actions were questionable. While the result was good, the means were unethical. The coworker might not have had a chance to defend herself or knew the review was fake, which could harm trust in the workplace.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author used deception for a good cause, but the method was wrong. Ethically, it's a breach of trust and honesty. Legally, it's risky. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
