She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that a coworker was being lazy and uncooperative, and the author wrote a fake negative customer review to try to get her to improve. The coworker changed her behavior after seeing the review, but the author is now feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical implications. The author used deception by creating a fake review. Even though the coworker improved, the method was underhanded. The coworker had a valid reason to be defensive if she found out the review was fake. Trust is a big factor here. Also, the coworker's poor performance was a real issue, and the author might have felt they had no other options since the owner's daughter was involved.\n\nHowever, the author could have tried other methods first, like direct communication or involving management. But the story mentions that others had already tried talking to her without success. The fake review was a last resort. Still, using deception can have negative consequences even if it worked this time. What if the coworker had reacted badly? Or if the owner found out and took it seriously? The author might have caused more harm than good.\n\nBut there's also an argument that the author acted in the best interest of the business and their fellow employees. The coworker's behavior was affecting customer service. The owner might not take action because of the friendship, so the author took matters into their own hands. The outcome was positive, so maybe the ends justified the means.\n\nOn the other hand, the fake review could be considered unethical and potentially illegal if it defamed the coworker. Even if it wasn't, it's a breach of trust. The coworker might feel betrayed, leading to a hostile work environment. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the potential wrongness of their actions.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author used a questionable method to solve a problem. While the outcome was good, the method involved deception and could have led to other issues. Ethically, it's a gray area, but in most cases, using fake reviews to manipulate someone, even with good intentions, is considered wrong. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
