She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author works in a small family-owned restaurant. Their coworker is described as lazy, uncooperative, and has a negative impact on customer service. The main issue is that despite multiple attempts by everyone, including the boss, to improve her behavior, she didn't change. The author found out that the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious. So, they wrote a fake negative review specifically targeting her, which led to her changing her appearance and work ethic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. Writing a fake review is generally considered unethical because it's a form of deception. Reviews are meant to be genuine expressions of customer experiences. By fabricating a review, the author manipulated the coworker's perception and possibly her job performance. Even though the outcome was positive, the method used was underhanded.\n\nAnother point is the coworker's relationship with the owner's daughter. The author couldn't get her fired, which might have been a factor in deciding to take matters into their own hands. However, the proper channel would have been to report her behavior through the correct management structure or HR, not to resort to fake reviews.\n\nThe coworker's improvement is a positive result, but does that justify the means? The author's action was a breach of trust and could have legal implications if discovered. Also, it's important to consider that the coworker might have felt humiliated or unfairly treated, which could affect her mental health or job satisfaction even if her work improved.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt that all options were exhausted and that this was the only way to help the coworker improve. However, there might have been alternative approaches, like formal mediation or performance improvement plans, which could have addressed the issue without deception.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the act of writing a fake review is deceptive and manipulative. Even with good intentions, the method is questionable. The author's guilt suggests they recognize this. So, while the outcome was beneficial, the action itself is ethically wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
