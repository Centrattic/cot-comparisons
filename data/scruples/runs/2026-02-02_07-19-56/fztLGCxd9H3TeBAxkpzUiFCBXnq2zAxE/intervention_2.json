She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review of their coworker. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a manager at a small family-owned business. Their coworker was really lazy, not performing well, and even had customer complaints. But because she's the owner's daughter's best friend, she wasn't fired. The author found out that the coworker checks customer reviews and is self-conscious. So, they wrote a fake negative review describing the coworker's bad service, making sure to include details like her appearance. The result was the coworker changed her behavior\u2014more piercings, different hair color, and improved work ethic. The author is now feeling guilty, wondering if there was a better way to approach it instead of using deception.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ethical aspects. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. The coworker didn't know the review was fake, so she was manipulated into changing her behavior. Even if the outcome was positive, the method was underhanded. Trust is important in a workplace, and the author's action could damage that trust if discovered. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker was resistant to feedback from others, including the boss and other employees. The author might have felt that traditional methods weren't working. But using a fake review is a violation of the coworker's right to honest interactions. It's a form of emotional manipulation, which is generally considered unethical.\n\nAnother angle is the author's responsibility as a manager. They have a role to address performance issues. If they didn't use the proper channels, like formal evaluations or HR, and instead resorted to a personal tactic, that could be seen as a breach of managerial duties. \n\nAlso, the coworker's self-consciousness was exploited. Using someone's insecurities to change their behavior is manipulative. Even if the result was good, the means were problematic. The author should have considered other approaches, even if they were frustrated.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the fake review itself. Posting false information can have legal implications, though in this case, it's a personal review. But the coworker's response was to change her appearance and work ethic, which might not have addressed the root issues. What if the review had led to her being fired or caused her emotional distress? The author's action could have unintended consequences.\n\nHowever, the coworker did improve, and the author might not have had other options. But that doesn't justify the method. There's a difference between doing something wrong because there's no other option and justifying it. The author should have perhaps escalated the issue more formally or sought help from higher management in a legitimate way.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might have been to improve the coworker's performance, the method used was deceptive and manipulative. Ethically, this is problematic because it violates trust and uses someone's insecurities. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
