She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the fake review is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wrote a fake customer review about their coworker to improve her work ethic. The coworker was lazy, had poor customer service, and despite others trying to help, she didn't improve. The author found out that the coworker reads reviews and is self-conscious, so they wrote a negative review describing her appearance and behavior. The result was that the coworker changed her appearance and work habits for the better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Writing a fake review to manipulate someone into changing their behavior could be seen as deceptive. The coworker didn't know it was fake, so the author used a form of manipulation. Even though the outcome was positive, the method was underhanded. The coworker might feel betrayed if she found out, since the review wasn't genuine. Also, the author didn't confront the coworker directly, which might have been the more honest approach, even if it was difficult. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's behavior was problematic, and she wasn't being addressed properly through normal channels. The owner's daughter's friendship protected her from being fired, so the author might have felt like they had to take matters into their own hands. But using a fake review as a tactic is a bit extreme and could be considered unethical because it's a lie. \n\nThere's also the question of whether the coworker's improvement was sustainable. If she's only improving because she's worried about another fake review, maybe her behavior won't last. Plus, there's the risk of legal issues if the review was defamatory. But since the coworker improved, maybe the author thinks it's justified. \n\nThe key points here are deception, manipulation, and the ethical implications of using a fake review. Even if the intention was good, the method might be wrong. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't use a direct approach, which could have been more respectful and honest, even if it didn't work. They should have tried talking to her again instead of resorting to a fake review. \n\nBut some might argue that the author had no other options and that the coworker's improvement is what matters. However, the method used is still questionable. So, considering all angles, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they used deception to achieve a positive outcome, which is ethically problematic.\n"
