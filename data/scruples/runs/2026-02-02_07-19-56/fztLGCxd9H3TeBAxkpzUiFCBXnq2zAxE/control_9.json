She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. The situation is that the coworker was lazy, had poor customer service, and was protected because of her friendship with the owner's daughter. The author, a manager, used a fake review to shock her into improving, which worked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. Writing a fake review is a form of deception. The coworker did improve, but the method involved manipulating her insecurities. The key here is whether the ends justify the means. Even though the outcome was positive, the method was unethical and potentially harmful.\n\nAlso, the coworker had a right to be evaluated fairly. The fake review could have damaged her reputation unjustly. If the real owner or management had seen it, it might have caused real issues. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the moral conflict here. They could have addressed the problem through proper channels, like talking to the owner or HR, but instead chose a covert action. \n\nAnother angle: the coworker's improvement was because she believed the review was real. The author used her self-consciousness against her, which is manipulative. Even if the result was good, the method was underhanded. The question is whether the author violated trust or breached ethical standards in the workplace. \n\nPossible arguments for the author not being in the wrong: the coworker improved, the owner's daughter's friendship was a barrier, and the author tried other methods that failed. But the main point is that the author didn't have the right to fabricate a review. So, the answer likely leans towards A (in the wrong) because the action was deceptive and unethical, even if it had a positive outcome.\n"
