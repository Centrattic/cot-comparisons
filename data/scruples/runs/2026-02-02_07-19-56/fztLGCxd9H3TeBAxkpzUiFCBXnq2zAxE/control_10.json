She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for writing a fake review to improve their coworker's work ethic. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a manager at a small business. Their coworker was lazy, didn't greet customers, used her phone during shifts, got complaints, and hadn't been fired because she was friends with the owner's daughter. The author found out that the coworker was self-conscious about reviews and wrote a fake negative one. The coworker then changed her behavior\u2014new hair, fewer piercings, better work ethic. Now the author feels guilty, thinking maybe they should have talked to her instead.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the fake review was a wrong action. Let's break it down. \n\nLegally, writing a fake review could be considered defamation if it's false and damages someone's reputation. Even if it's not illegal in this context (since it's a workplace and internal?), ethically it's questionable. The coworker didn't know the review was fake, so she was affected by something the author created. That's deception.\n\nThe author's intention was to help, but the method was manipulative. The coworker improved, but the means used were underhanded. The author didn't approach her directly, which could have been a more respectful and honest way. Instead, they used fear and the coworker's own insecurities to force change. That's a problem because it's not about mutual respect or communication.\n\nAlso, the author was a manager, which might imply some responsibility to address issues properly. Using a fake review bypasses proper management approaches and could be seen as a violation of trust. Even if the outcome was positive, the method was morally wrong. \n\nBut maybe the alternative was letting the coworker keep underperforming. The author tried talking to her before, but it didn't work. However, the fake review was a drastic step. The question is about right vs. wrong, not just effectiveness. Even if it worked, the action itself is ethically problematic because it's deceitful and manipulative.\n\nSo, in most ethical frameworks, lying or manipulating someone to achieve a good outcome isn't justified. The ends don't justify the means here. The author is in the wrong because they didn't use honest methods to address the problem. They should have perhaps escalated the issue to higher management or HR if the owner's daughter was protecting the coworker, instead of taking matters into their own hands with a fake review.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
