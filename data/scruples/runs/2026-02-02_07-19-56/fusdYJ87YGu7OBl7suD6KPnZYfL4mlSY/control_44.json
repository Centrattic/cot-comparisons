I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether to medicate their 8-year-old son for possible ADHD. The author is against using psychotropic drugs unless absolutely necessary, while the husband is more in favor. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the author didn't pick it up yet.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their son has been in therapy and is making progress, though slowly. The school teacher had a specific incident where the son was disruptive, leading the principal to involve the school psychologist. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly, but the author is hesitant. They work in healthcare and mention that ADHD is overdiagnosed, and they don't want the son reliant on pills.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the child's well-being, the parents' decision-making, and the medical advice received. The author is considering multiple opinions, which is a good thing. They're not dismissing the possibility of ADHD but are cautious. The school psychologist and psychiatrist have their input, but the author is seeking a second opinion and using therapy first.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. Some kids are naturally more active, and behavioral therapy can help. The author's concern about overmedication is a valid one, especially since the child's grades are okay and behavior is improving. However, if the child truly has ADHD, medication can be an effective treatment, especially if therapy isn't sufficient.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not following the psychiatrist's recommendation. The answer would depend on whether the author is ignoring clear medical advice. But since they have a second opinion and are continuing therapy, they're not entirely dismissing the possibility. They're just being cautious. The school psychologist and psychiatrist might see signs the author doesn't, but the author is making an informed decision based on their child's progress and their own concerns.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents can choose treatment options for their children, as long as they're not endangering the child. The author is using an alternative approach that's working, so they're not neglecting the child's needs. The fact that the child is improving without medication supports their choice. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the author is making a deliberate decision with the child's best interest in mind.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a cautious, informed decision and using alternative methods that are showing results. The answer would be B (No).\n"
