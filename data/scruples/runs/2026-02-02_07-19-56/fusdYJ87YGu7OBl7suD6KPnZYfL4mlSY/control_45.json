I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The parent's son has been exhibiting disruptive behaviors at school, and after a specific incident, the school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. The parent got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the parent hasn't picked up the prescription yet. The parent is more cautious, believing ADHD is overdiagnosed and preferring behavioral therapy, which is showing some progress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical guidelines. ADHD diagnosis typically requires a comprehensive evaluation, including symptoms in multiple settings and impairment in functioning. The child's grades are slightly above average, so academic performance isn't severely affected. The parent is using cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a valid treatment approach. The school psychologist's assessment might not be enough for a definitive diagnosis; a proper diagnosis usually involves a psychiatrist or a specialist. However, the second psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot, which raises a red flag\u2014maybe too hasty?\n\nThe parent's hesitation could be seen as cautious, given the potential for overdiagnosis. The child is still young, and behavioral issues can be part of typical development. On the other hand, if the child truly has ADHD, delaying treatment could affect his social and academic life. The parent is working in healthcare, so they might have more information on this. They also mention the child's behavior is improving with therapy, which supports their current approach. The husband is pro-medication, but the decision should ideally be a collaborative one between parents.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? It's a balance between necessary treatment and avoiding overmedication. The key points are the child's improving behavior without meds, the potential overdiagnosis, and the parent's professional background. The answer hinges on whether the parent is making an informed, reasonable decision based on available evidence. Since the child is showing progress with therapy and the diagnosis isn't confirmed by multiple evaluations, the parent's stance seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
