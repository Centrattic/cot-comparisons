I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has an 8-year-old son with behavioral issues at school, like being a class clown and disrupting. They've been using cognitive behavioral therapy, and it's helping slowly. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author hasn't picked up the prescription yet. The author is in the healthcare field and is skeptical about ADHD being overdiagnosed and wants to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. The husband is pro-medication.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider the ethical, medical, and practical aspects. The key points are: the child's well-being, the effectiveness of therapy versus medication, and the possibility of overdiagnosis.\n\nThe author is making a choice based on their professional background and personal beliefs. They are not refusing all treatment\u2014they're using therapy. They are also seeking a second opinion, which is responsible. The child's grades are okay, and the therapy is showing some progress. But the school is concerned enough to involve a psychologist, indicating that the behavior is significant.\n\nADHD is a medical diagnosis, and medication can be effective for some children. However, it's also true that ADHD is sometimes overdiagnosed. The author's caution is understandable, especially given their healthcare background. They are not dismissing the issue but are prioritizing non-pharmacological approaches first.\n\nParental decisions about a child's treatment can be complex. The author is considering both the potential benefits and risks of medication. The child's safety and long-term mental health are important. The author's approach might be seen as cautious rather than wrong, but it's also possible that the author is underestimating the potential benefits of medication if the diagnosis is correct.\n\nHowever, the post mentions that the child's behavior is improving with therapy. If therapy is working, maybe the author is right to avoid medication. But if the behavior is significantly disruptive and affecting the child's education, maybe medication is necessary. The dilemma here is balancing immediate intervention with long-term reliance on drugs.\n\nIn terms of ethics, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, provided they act in the child's best interest. The author is not refusing all treatment, just medication. They are open to a second opinion, which shows they are not being closed-minded. However, the school's involvement and the psychologist's recommendation suggest that there is a valid concern that the author might not be addressing adequately by only using therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is correct that the diagnosis is overdiagnosis, then starting medication could be harmful. The author's healthcare background gives them some credibility in questioning the diagnosis, but it's important to note that a single psychiatrist's assessment might not be sufficient.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on their professional judgment and personal values. While there's a valid concern about the child's behavior and the school's role, the author is taking a non-medication approach that shows some progress. However, the question of whether they're in the wrong depends on the accuracy of the ADHD diagnosis and the effectiveness of therapy. Since the answer has to be A or B, I need to decide if the author is wrong. Given the information, the author is making a decision that is cautious and based on their experience, but they might be ignoring the medical advice of a professional. However, they are seeking another opinion and are not refusing all treatment. So maybe the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
