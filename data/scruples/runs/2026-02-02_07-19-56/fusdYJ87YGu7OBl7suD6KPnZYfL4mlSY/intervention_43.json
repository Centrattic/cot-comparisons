I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves the child's behavior in school, a school psychologist suggesting ADHD, a psychiatrist prescribing Ritalin on the spot, and the parent's hesitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parent is a healthcare worker, which might give them some insight into medical practices. They mention the child's behavior is improving with therapy, grades are okay, and they're concerned about overdiagnosis. They're pro-therapy and cautious about medication, not anti-vax but want to avoid unnecessary drugs.\n\nThe other side is the husband and school's push for medication. The school principal sent the child to a psychologist, and the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately. The parent is worried about dependency and the root causes of behavior. The question is whether the parent is wrong for resisting medication.\n\nI should think about medical guidelines. ADHD diagnosis in children requires a thorough evaluation. A school psychologist might not be the best source for a diagnosis; a pediatric psychiatrist is more reliable. However, the psychiatrist here prescribed on the spot, which might be rushed. The parent's caution is valid here. Also, behavioral therapy is a proven method for ADHD management. The child's improvement with CBT suggests it's working, so maybe the diagnosis isn't clear.\n\nThe parent's stance is more about trusting therapy and avoiding medication unless certain. The husband's argument is for medication. The parent isn't denying the possibility of ADHD but is skeptical due to overdiagnosis and quick prescriptions. They also mention the child's behavior is age-appropriate in some ways.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, the answer depends on whether they're ignoring a potential medical issue. But if the diagnosis is uncertain, and therapy is effective, the parent's choice is reasonable. The psychiatrist might have made a quick judgment, so the parent's caution is understandable. However, if ADHD is actually present, not treating could affect the child's future. But the parent is considering alternatives. So maybe not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
