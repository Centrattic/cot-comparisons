I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves a child with behavioral issues at school, and professionals are suggesting ADHD medication, but the parent is hesitant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The school and a psychologist think the child might have ADHD and recommend medication. The husband is in favor of medication, and the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately. On the other hand, the parent (the questioner) is cautious, relying on their experience in healthcare, and prefers continuing behavioral therapy since there's some progress.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. It's possible that the child's behavior is just typical for an 8-year-old, especially since his grades are above average. The parent mentions that their other kids are okay, so maybe this child is just more active. Also, the school psychologist's assessment might be rushed since they only saw one incident. The parent's hesitation isn't anti-science; they're cautious about overmedication, which is a valid concern given that ADHD is sometimes overdiagnosed.\n\nThe parent is taking a proactive approach with therapy, which can be effective. They want to address the root issues rather than rely on medication. Their husband's push for medication might be based on good intentions but could overlook the child's specific case. The parent's decision to seek a second opinion and not start medication yet isn't neglectful. They're making an informed choice based on their understanding of their child and their professional background.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that ADHD can have real impacts, and if the child's behavior is significantly disruptive and affecting his learning, medication might help. But since the child is already improving with therapy, maybe it's reasonable to continue that path. The parent isn't refusing all medical advice but is being cautious and seeking more information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're making a thoughtful decision considering their child's unique situation and the potential risks of medication. They're not dismissing professional advice entirely but are taking a measured approach. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
