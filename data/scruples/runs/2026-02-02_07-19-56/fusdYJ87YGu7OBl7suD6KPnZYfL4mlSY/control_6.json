I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The author is the parent who's against medication, while the husband is pro-medication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is described as a class clown with some disruptive behavior, but his grades are fine, and he's making progress with therapy. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the parents got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The parent hasn't picked up the medication yet because they believe ADHD is overdiagnosed and prefer behavioral therapy. \n\nThe key points here are the child's current progress with therapy, the parent's concerns about overmedication, and the possibility that the child's behavior is age-appropriate. ADHD diagnosis can be tricky; it's not just about hyperactivity but also inattention and impulsivity. If the child's grades are slightly above average and he's improving with therapy, maybe medication isn't necessary right now. \n\nThe parent works in healthcare and is cautious about medication, which is a valid perspective. Medication can have side effects, and some studies show that non-pharmacological approaches can be effective for mild cases. However, the school is involved, so there's a balance between the child's needs at school and home. The parent's stance is to address the root cause through therapy rather than quick fixes. \n\nBut, it's important to consider that ADHD is a medical condition that can benefit from a combination of therapy and medication. The school psychologist's assessment might be based on observed behavior in a school setting, which could differ from home. The parent's decision to seek a second opinion was appropriate, but ignoring the psychiatrist's recommendation without further evaluation could be risky if the child actually has ADHD and needs medication for optimal development.\n\nHowever, since the child is showing improvement with therapy, and the parent is not dismissing the possibility of ADHD but rather cautious, it's a grey area. The parent isn't in the wrong if they're making an informed decision based on their child's progress and personal values, especially with a healthcare background. They're not refusing all medical advice but are taking a measured approach. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent is making a conscious, informed choice and the child's behavior is improving with therapy. It's a complex issue without clear right or wrong, but the parent is acting in their child's best interest based on available information.\n"
