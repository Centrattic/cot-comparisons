I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent deciding whether to medicate their 8-year-old son for suspected ADHD. The parent is against medication and prefers behavioral therapy, which is showing some progress. The other parent, the husband, is more in favor of medication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The school reported significant disruptions, and a school psychologist suggested ADHD. However, the parent got a second opinion, and the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately. The parent hasn't filled the prescription yet, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed and preferring non-drug approaches. The child's grades are slightly above average and behavior is improving with therapy. The parent's argument is that the child is a typical kid with some issues, not necessarily ADHD.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of medical ethics, parents do have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, including the choice to pursue non-pharmacological treatments. The parent is using a second opinion and is considering the long-term effects of medication. They're not outright refusing medication but are cautious and want to explore alternatives first. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, which might support their approach.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if the child's behavior is significantly disruptive and the professionals are suggesting medication, the parent might be neglecting a potential effective treatment. However, the parent is actively involved in therapy and monitoring the child's progress. It's a balance between medical advice and parental judgment.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky, especially in children. It's possible the child's behavior is within the normal range for his age. The parent's healthcare background might make them more aware of overdiagnosis issues. However, they should also consider the possibility that the child could benefit from medication in the long run.\n\nThe parent isn't ignoring the problem but is taking a cautious, step-by-step approach. The fact that the child's behavior is improving with therapy is a positive sign. The parent's stance isn't against all medication but is waiting for more certainty. So, they might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
