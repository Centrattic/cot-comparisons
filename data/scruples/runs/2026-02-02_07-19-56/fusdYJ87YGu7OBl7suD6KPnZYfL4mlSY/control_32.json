I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old on psychotropic drugs. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The child is 8, has been acting out in school\u2014class clown, disruptions. The parents have been using CBT, and it's working slowly. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and meds, but the parents got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The mom is reluctant, hasn't picked up the prescription yet. She works in healthcare and thinks ADHD is overdiagnosed, prefers behavioral therapy. The husband is pro-medication. The mom's argument is that the child's behavior is improving with therapy, and she doesn't want him relying on pills.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Legally, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, so unless there's a court case or intervention, she's not breaking the law. Ethically, it's a bit more nuanced. ADHD diagnosis can be tricky\u2014some kids do have it, others don't. The mom is cautious, which is understandable. The child's grades are fine, and behavior is improving with therapy. The school says he's disruptive, but maybe there are other factors. \n\nThe key points here are that the parents are seeking multiple opinions and trying therapy first. The mom is not anti-medication but believes in using it only when necessary. The child's progress with CBT suggests that it might be effective. The psychiatrist's immediate prescription might be seen as hasty, which the mom is rightly concerned about. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the child truly has ADHD, delaying medication could affect his ability to learn or socialize. But the mom's stance is that the behavior is manageable without meds. The school's role here is also a factor\u2014maybe they need to adapt their teaching methods to accommodate different learning styles. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are not ignoring the problem. They're engaging with professionals and trying a non-pharmacological approach. The mom's healthcare background might give her insight into the potential overuse of medications. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to explore other options first. The answer would be B (No).\n"
