I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an impartial view, so I need to consider both sides carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's 8-year-old son has behavioral issues at school, leading to a recommendation for ADHD medication. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the author hasn't picked it up yet. They're using behavioral therapy instead, which is showing some progress. The author is in the healthcare field and is skeptical about overprescribing, while her husband is pro-medication. The main question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to put her son on psychotropic drugs.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. It's not just about hyperactivity but also inattention and impulsivity. The school mentions he's a \"class clown\" and disrupts, but his grades are okay. The author thinks he's just a typical kid with attention span issues. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly, which the author is concerned about. She prefers therapy and avoiding medication unless 100% necessary.\n\nOn one hand, ADHD is a medical condition that can benefit from medication for some patients. If the child is genuinely struggling, and medication is a valid treatment, withholding it might prevent him from getting help. However, the author is making an informed decision based on her own experience in healthcare and the progress they're seeing with therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is cautious and not dismissing the possibility entirely but is seeking alternative approaches. She's not ignoring the problem; she's addressing it through therapy, which is a valid and effective method for some cases. The fact that the son's behavior is improving with therapy suggests that this approach might work, and the author is considering the long-term effects of medication.\n\nThe key points here are that the author is not anti-medication, is willing to consider a second opinion, and is taking steps that are showing some progress. The school's frustration is valid, but the author is trying to manage the situation without jumping to medication. The decision isn't made lightly, and she's actively involved in her son's care.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author's approach seems reasonable. She's not denying the possibility of ADHD but is cautious about overdiagnosis and overmedication. Since the son is improving with therapy, it's a valid choice to continue that path for now. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
