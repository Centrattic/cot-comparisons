I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kid is acting out in school, labeled as a class clown, disruptive. The school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the parent hasn't picked up the prescription. The parent is in healthcare, thinks ADHD might be overdiagnosed, and prefers behavioral therapy, which is showing some progress. The husband is pro-medication.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to see if I agree. So I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the school and professionals are suggesting medication. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication can be effective. The parent's concern about overmedication is valid, but there's a risk of not treating a possible real condition. If the child truly has ADHD, untreated, it could lead to more problems academically, socially, and in the long term. The parent might be ignoring a legitimate medical need.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is working in healthcare, so they might have more insight into the system. They see improvements in therapy, and maybe the kid's behavior is improving without meds. They\u2019re cautious, which is understandable, especially given the potential for overdiagnosis. Also, the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot without much discussion, which might not be the best approach. The parent is taking a cautious stance, which could be seen as responsible, especially if the therapy is working.\n\nBut the key points are: the school is involved, the psychologist and psychiatrist have suggested medication, and the parent is hesitating. The author is not anti-med, just cautious. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not following through with the prescription.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children. However, if there's a consensus among professionals that medication is needed, refusing could be seen as neglecting treatment. But since the parent is getting a second opinion and is in a healthcare field, maybe their decision is informed. The child's grades are slightly above average, so maybe the ADHD isn't severe. But the disruptive behavior could still be a problem.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong if their decision is based on informed choices and ongoing improvements with therapy. However, if the child's behavior is significantly impacting school and the professionals are advising medication, there's a balance between caution and necessary treatment.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is based on sufficient evidence and professional input. Since they're in healthcare, maybe their perspective is informed, but they might be dismissing the possibility of ADHD prematurely. However, the school is concerned, and the husband is pro-medication. The parent might not be in the wrong if they're monitoring the situation and the therapy is showing results, but they should definitely keep in communication with professionals to ensure the child isn't being harmed by not treating a possible condition. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but the parent should consider seeking more evaluations if the behavior persists.\n"
