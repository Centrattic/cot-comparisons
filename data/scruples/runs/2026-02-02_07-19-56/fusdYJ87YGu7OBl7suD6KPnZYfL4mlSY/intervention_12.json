I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The question requires me to answer A or B based on my analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent has an 8-year-old son with behavioral issues at school. The school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication, but the parent, who works in healthcare, is hesitant. They prefer behavioral therapy instead. The husband is pro-medication, but the parent hasn't picked up the prescription. They believe ADHD is overdiagnosed and want to avoid making the child reliant on pills.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's stance against immediate medication, their reliance on behavioral therapy, and their concern about overdiagnosis. On the other hand, the school and a psychiatrist are pushing for medication. The parent's argument is that the child's behavior is improving with therapy and that they don't want to medicate unless absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and medical aspects. ADHD is a medical condition with established diagnostic criteria, and treatment often includes a combination of therapy and medication. However, each child is different, and treatment plans can vary. Parents have the right to make informed decisions about their child's healthcare, and it's important to consider their values and concerns.\n\nThe parent's position isn't anti-science; they're cautious and prefer a non-pharmacological approach first, especially since the child's grades are okay and behavior is improving. However, there's a risk of underdiagnosing ADHD if the child actually has it. On the other hand, overmedicating without proper diagnosis is also a concern.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The answer would depend on balancing the child's needs, evidence-based practices, and the parent's right to make choices. Since the parent is seeking alternatives and is not refusing all treatment but is cautious, it's a nuanced situation. However, the school and psychiatrist's recommendations are based on professional assessments. The parent's refusal could be seen as withholding potential effective treatment, but their caution is also valid.\n\nIn many cases, a collaborative approach between parents, healthcare providers, and educators is ideal. The parent's stance here is not necessarily wrong because they are making an informed choice based on their child's progress in therapy. However, it's important that they continue to monitor the situation and remain open to adjusting the treatment plan if needed. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a considered decision based on their child's progress and personal values, even if it's a controversial choice.\n"
