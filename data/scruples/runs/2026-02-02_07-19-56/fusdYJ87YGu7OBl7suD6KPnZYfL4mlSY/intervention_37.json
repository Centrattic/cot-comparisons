I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs, specifically ADHD medication. The author is a parent who has been using behavioral therapy and is reluctant to start medication unless it's absolutely necessary. They mention their son has some behavioral issues at school but is improving with therapy, and they believe ADHD is overdiagnosed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school psychologist suggested ADHD, but the author sought a second opinion. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot, but the author hasn't picked up the medication yet. The parent is in the healthcare field, so they have some medical knowledge, which might influence their decision. They're not anti-vax, just cautious about medication for ADHD. The husband is more pro-medication, leading to some conflict.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether withholding medication is wrong. ADHD is a medical condition, and medication can be effective. However, the parent is not dismissing professional advice but seeking alternative views. They have a valid point about overdiagnosis and want to continue therapy. The child's grades are okay, and behavior is improving. The parent is making an informed decision based on their knowledge and experience, even though they're going against the psychiatrist's recommendation.\n\nBut is it wrong? It's a personal decision. The parent is not refusing all treatment but is choosing a different approach. There's no legal or ethical obligation here unless there's harm. The child isn't in immediate danger, just has behavioral issues that might be managed through therapy. The parent is considering long-term effects of medication and the child's dependency. It's a balance between medical advice and personal judgment. The answer isn't black and white, but since the parent is actively addressing the issue through therapy and is informed, it's not necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
