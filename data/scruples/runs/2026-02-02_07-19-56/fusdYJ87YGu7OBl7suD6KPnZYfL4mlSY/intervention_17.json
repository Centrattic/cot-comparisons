I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. They're getting advice from Reddit, and the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The child is described as a class clown who disrupts school, leading to calls from the school. They've been in therapy for a while with some progress. The school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication. Then a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin but the parent hasn't picked it up yet. The parent is in healthcare and skeptical about ADHD diagnosis, thinking it's over-diagnosed. They prefer behavioral therapy and don't want the child on meds unless absolutely necessary.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the child's behavior is problematic but improving with therapy. The school is involved, and a professional suggested medication. The parent is hesitant because they think ADHD is over-diagnosed and prefer non-medical approaches. The husband is pro-medication, but the parent is holding off.\n\nNow, to determine if the parent is in the wrong. The question is about whether they're making the right decision. Legally, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, including refusing medication, unless there's a court intervention. Ethically, it's more complex. The parent is using an alternative approach (CBT) which is working, albeit slowly. Their reasoning is that the child's behavior is age-appropriate and improving. However, if the school is involved and there's a professional opinion suggesting ADHD, there might be concerns about the child's well-being and education.\n\nBut the parent is not ignoring the problem. They're getting a second opinion and considering therapy. The issue is about the balance between medical advice and parental judgment. ADHD is a legitimate condition, and medication can be effective. However, the parent's stance is that the child doesn't have ADHD and that therapy is sufficient. There's also the aspect of the parent's experience in healthcare, which might inform their skepticism.\n\nIs the parent wrong for not following the psychiatrist's prescription? Well, the parent hasn't denied the child medication; they're just delaying it. They have a valid reason based on their own experience and the child's progress in therapy. However, there's also a risk that without medication, the child's behavior could worsen, affecting his school experience. But the parent is proactive in using therapy.\n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), the Reddit community often considers the nuances. If the child is improving with therapy, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the child's behavior is significantly impacting his education and the school is concerned, some might argue that medication could help. However, the parent's approach isn't harmful\u2014it's just a different path. They're not ignoring the issue, just choosing a non-medical route.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). The parent is making an informed decision based on their child's progress and their own professional background, even if it's against the initial recommendation. But there's a counterpoint that ADHD should be treated medically if diagnosed. However, the diagnosis here isn't confirmed definitively; the school psychologist suggested it, but the parent got a second opinion. It's possible the child doesn't have ADHD, and the parent is correct in seeking more evidence before medicating.\n"
