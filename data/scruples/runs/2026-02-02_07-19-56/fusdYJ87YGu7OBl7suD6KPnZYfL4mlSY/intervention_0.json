I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves a child with behavioral issues at school, and the school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. The author is against it, prefers therapy, and their husband is pro-medication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The child is 8 years old, has been acting out, especially in school, and the school thinks ADHD. The parents are in a disagreement. The author is a healthcare worker, which might influence their skepticism towards medication. They mention that the child's behavior is improving with therapy, grades are slightly above average, and they don't think ADHD is the case here.\n\nADHD diagnosis in children can be tricky. There's a known overdiagnosis issue, but it's also a real condition. The key here is whether the author is making an informed decision. They have a second opinion but chose not to follow it. The school psychologist thought ADHD was likely, and the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot. But the author hasn't picked up the medication, relying instead on ongoing therapy.\n\nThe question is about whether they're in the wrong. Legally, parents have the right to choose their child's treatment, so unless there's a court order or a legal requirement, the answer might be B. Ethically, it's more complex. If the child's behavior is affecting school and social life significantly, delaying medication could be harmful. But if the child is making progress with therapy, maybe it's not necessary.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that behavioral therapy is working and they don't want the child on drugs. But is their judgment clouded by personal bias? They work in healthcare and are aware of possible overprescription. That might be valid, but they also need to trust medical professionals. The school and a psychiatrist have suggested medication, which is a red flag if ignored. However, the husband's second opinion is just one psychiatrist's call. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong for not following medical advice. Since parents have autonomy, and the child isn't in immediate danger, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if there's clear evidence of ADHD and not treating it could lead to long-term problems, then the author might be negligent. But the child's grades are okay, and therapy is showing progress. \n\nSo, the answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong, because they are considering alternative approaches and have their child's best interest in mind. However, there's a risk of not addressing the problem if it's truly ADHD. But without concrete evidence, it's a judgment call. The author is making a decision based on their observations and professional insight, which is their right as a parent.\n"
