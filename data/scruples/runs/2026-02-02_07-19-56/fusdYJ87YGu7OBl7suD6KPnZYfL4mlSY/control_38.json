I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author has an 8-year-old son with behavioral issues in school, like being a class clown and disrupting classes. They've been using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the kid is making progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author hasn't filled the prescription yet. The husband is pro-medication, but the author is cautious, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed and preferring to address the root cause through therapy. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their kid on meds.\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments for and against. On one side, the school is involved, and they're suggesting medication. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin after a quick assessment. The author is in healthcare and thinks psychiatrists sometimes write scripts too quickly. They believe in behavioral therapy, which is working slowly. On the other hand, maybe ADHD is a real issue, and without medication, the kid's behavior might worsen. The author's stance is that the child is improving, so maybe they're right to avoid meds for now.\n\nADHD diagnosis in children can be tricky. Symptoms like hyperactivity and attention issues can be part of normal childhood behavior. The author mentions the kid's grades are slightly above average, so maybe the academic performance isn't suffering. The therapist is making progress, so maybe the behavioral approach is sufficient. However, the school is frustrated, and the child's behavior could affect his learning and social interactions if not addressed. \n\nThe author isn't anti-medication but wants to be cautious. They have a valid point about overdiagnosis and the potential long-term effects of medication. However, there's also a responsibility to consider the child's needs. If the behavior is causing significant disruption, even with therapy, medication might be necessary. But the author hasn't ruled out other options yet. \n\nThe key points are the child's improving behavior with therapy, the author's profession in healthcare, and the differing opinions on medication. The husband's pro-medication stance vs. the author's caution. The school's concern vs. the parent's decision. \n\nIn the end, parental decisions about their child's health are complex. There's no one-size-fits-all. If the child is responding to therapy and not having academic issues, maybe the author is right to avoid meds. However, if there's a risk of worsening behavior, maybe they should consider medication. The author is not in the wrong if they're making an informed decision based on their child's progress and their own judgment as a healthcare professional. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
