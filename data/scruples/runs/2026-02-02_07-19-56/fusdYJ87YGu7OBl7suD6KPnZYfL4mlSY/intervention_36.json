I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The author's son is described as a class clown with some behavioral issues, but his grades are slightly above average and he's making progress in therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, and a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author, working in healthcare, is cautious and thinks ADHD is overdiagnosed. They prefer behavioral therapy and are concerned about relying on medication.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasoning versus the medical professionals' recommendations. The author believes that behavioral therapy is working, albeit slowly, and doesn't want to medicate unless absolutely necessary. They also mention their son is only slightly more hyperactive than siblings and that his behavior is improving.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is pro-medication and the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot. The school principal sent the child to the psychologist after a specific incident, leading to the ADHD suggestion. The author is not anti-vaccine, which is important, but they do have reservations about overmedication.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether withholding medication is wrong. It's a medical and ethical decision. The author is making an informed choice based on their observations and professional background. There's no indication that the child is in immediate harm, just school disruptions. The child's grades are okay, and therapy is making progress. The author is seeking a second opinion and is not ignoring the problem but is cautious.\n\nThe dilemma here is balancing medical advice with parental judgment. The author isn't refusing treatment entirely but is opting for a non-pharmacological approach first. Since the child's behavior is improving with therapy, the author's approach might be reasonable. However, the medical professionals' advice is based on their assessment, which the author isn't fully convinced by.\n\nIn the US, parents generally have the right to choose their child's treatment unless a child is in danger, which isn't stated here. The author isn't ignoring the issue but is taking a measured approach. So, based on the information given, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a decision based on their child's progress and their own judgment as a healthcare professional. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
