I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The kid is 8 years old, has behavioral issues at school, and there's a suggestion from a school psychologist that he might have ADHD. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin, but the parent hasn't picked it up yet. The parent works in healthcare, is cautious about medication, believes the child is improving with behavioral therapy, and is concerned about overdiagnosis and overmedication.\n\nThe author is seeking validation on whether they're in the wrong. The key points here are the parent's decision to avoid medication in favor of therapy, which is showing some progress, and their concerns about ADHD being overdiagnosed. \n\nI should consider medical guidelines. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication can be an effective treatment, especially when combined with behavioral therapy. However, the decision to medicate should be a shared one between parents and healthcare providers. The parent here is getting a second opinion and considering non-pharmacological approaches first, which is not uncommon. \n\nThere's also the aspect of parental judgment. The parent has experience in healthcare, so their caution might be informed by professional knowledge. The child's grades are slightly above average, and the behavior is improving with therapy. Some might argue that the parent is right to explore alternatives first, while others might think medication is necessary given the persistent disruptions.\n\nThe question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Legally, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children unless it's proven harmful. Ethically, it's a balance between the potential benefits of medication and the risks of overmedication. Since the child is showing some improvement without medication, and the parent is not ignoring the issue (they're using therapy), it's a reasonable approach. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The school's concern is valid, and without medication, the behavior might not improve enough, affecting the child's education. However, the parent is working on behavioral therapy, which is a valid method. The answer likely hinges on whether the parent's judgment is reasonable given the information they have.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent isn't in the wrong for choosing a cautious approach and seeking alternatives first. So the answer would be B.\n"
