I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about whether to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs for possible ADHD. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's son is causing disruptions at school, labeled as a \"class clown.\" The school psychologist suggested ADHD and meds, but the author is hesitant. They've been using CBT and see some progress. The husband wants meds, but the author is against it unless absolutely necessary. The author works in healthcare and is skeptical about overdiagnosis of ADHD.\n\nThe key points here are: the child's behavior is improving with therapy, the author is cautious about medication, and there's a second opinion that led to a prescription. The author hasn't picked up the meds yet, and there's a disagreement with the spouse about the approach.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. It's not just hyperactivity but also inattention, impulsivity, etc. The school's perspective might be based on classroom behavior, but the author's child is doing okay academically. The author's concern about overmedication is valid since ADHD is sometimes overdiagnosed. They prefer behavioral therapy, which can be effective, especially when progress is slow but happening.\n\nHowever, the school psychologist and psychiatrist both suggested meds. The author is getting a second opinion but is still hesitant. The child is 8, so his behavior might be typical of his age. The author is trying to address the root cause through therapy rather than relying on pills.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the child truly has ADHD, and delaying meds could affect his future academic performance or social interactions. The husband's push for meds might be based on professional advice.\n\nBut the author is not dismissing the possibility entirely; they're just being cautious. They have a valid point about overdiagnosis and the risks of medication. Since the behavior is improving with therapy, maybe it's better to continue that approach first.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're not following the psychiatrist's recommendation. On the other, they're considering alternative methods and the child's progress. The answer might depend on the balance between professional advice and parental judgment. Since the author is making an informed decision based on their child's current progress and their own healthcare knowledge, they might not be in the wrong. The question is whether they're ignoring professional recommendations, but since they got a second opinion and are still deciding, it's a reasonable stance. So probably answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
