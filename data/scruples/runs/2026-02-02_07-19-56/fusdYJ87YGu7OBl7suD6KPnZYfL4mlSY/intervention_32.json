I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The son is 8, has behavioral issues in school, and was diagnosed with ADHD by a school psychologist. The school psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly, but the author hesitated, preferring behavioral therapy instead. The author works in healthcare and thinks ADHD is overdiagnosed. They believe therapy is working and don't want their son reliant on medication.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. I have to consider both sides. On one hand, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children. The author is cautious about medication, especially since the son's grades are okay and therapy is showing some progress. They might be right to be skeptical of quick diagnoses and prescriptions.\n\nOn the other hand, ADHD is a recognized medical condition. If the child actually has ADHD, not treating it could hinder their academic and social development. The school psychologist and psychiatrist might have legitimate reasons for recommending medication. The author is the parent, so their judgment is key, but they should also consider professional opinions and ensure they're not withholding necessary treatment.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is correctly assessing the situation. If they are right that the child doesn't have ADHD, then they're justified. But if the child does have ADHD and medication is appropriate, withholding it could be harmful. However, the author isn't completely dismissing it; they're seeking a second opinion and focusing on therapy. It's a balance between parental choice and medical advice.\n\nIn the end, the decision is the parent's, and as long as they're making an informed choice, they might not be in the wrong. The key is that the author is actively involved and not ignoring all medical advice but is cautious. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
