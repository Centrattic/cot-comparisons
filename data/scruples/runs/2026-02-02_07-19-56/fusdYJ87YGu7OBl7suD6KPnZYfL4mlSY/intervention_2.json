I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their child on psychotropic drugs. The situation is that the son is acting out in school, the school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication, but the author is hesitant. They've been using CBT and see some progress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical and ethical aspects. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication like Ritalin can be effective. However, the author believes it's overdiagnosed and prefers behavioral therapy. The husband is pro-medication, so there's a conflict here.\n\nThe author works in healthcare, so they might have some informed opinions. But they also admit that their son's behavior is improving with therapy. The school is involved, and the principal is concerned. The author hasn't picked up the prescription yet after five days, which is the part causing the AITA question.\n\nI should think about the balance between medical recommendations and personal beliefs. Parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, and it's not automatically wrong to seek more information or prefer non-pharmacological approaches. However, there's a responsibility to act in the child's best interest.\n\nThe author is not anti-vax or against medication entirely, just cautious. They want to avoid overmedicating. On the other hand, ADHD can impact a child's life significantly if untreated. The school's perspective is important too\u2014academic and social development.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not giving medication if the diagnosis is accurate? It's hard to say without more info. The AITA format is about societal judgment, not legal or medical. The community might have mixed views. Some might support the author's caution, others might think they're ignoring potential issues.\n\nI need to remember that the author is seeking an impartial view, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. The key points are: the child's behavior is improving with therapy, the author is not dismissing the possibility of ADHD but is cautious, and there's a conflict between medical advice and personal preference.\n\nIn terms of answer, the options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But considering the author's cautious approach and the effectiveness of therapy, maybe B is the right answer. It's a complex issue without a clear right or wrong.\n"
