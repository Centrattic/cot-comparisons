I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person asking the question (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThe author has an 8-year-old son who's been acting out in school. He's been labeled a \"class clown\" and is disruptive. The school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication, but the author hasn't picked up the prescription yet. They prefer behavioral therapy, which they say is working slowly. The author works in healthcare and is skeptical about ADHD overdiagnosis. Their husband is pro-medication. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not proceeding with the medication.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The school identified a problem behavior, and the psychologist and psychiatrist both suggested ADHD and medication. The author is hesitant because they think ADHD might be overdiagnosed and prefer non-medical interventions. The school psychologist recommended medication even though grades are fine, and the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly.\n\nNow, what are the factors that determine if the author is in the wrong? Medical ethics, child's well-being, parental rights, professional opinions, and evidence-based practices.\n\nOn one hand, professionals are suggesting medication, which might be the standard approach for ADHD. The school is involved, indicating that the behavior is impacting the child's education and others. The author is a healthcare worker, which gives them some credibility in questioning overprescription, but they might be underestimating the need for medication if ADHD is accurate.\n\nOn the other hand, behavioral therapy can be effective for some children with ADHD, especially if the diagnosis is questionable. The author's son is showing some improvement with therapy, which might support their decision. However, ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can have long-term impacts if untreated. Medication can help manage symptoms that interfere with learning and social interactions.\n\nThe author's hesitation is understandable, given concerns about overdiagnosis and overmedication. However, ADHD diagnosis involves a thorough evaluation, and if it's properly diagnosed, medication can be appropriate. The author's reliance on their own judgment without a comprehensive assessment might be risky. Also, the school's involvement adds another layer, as the child's behavior affects the classroom environment.\n\nAnother point is that the author is not anti-vax or anti-medication in general but is cautious. That's a responsible stance. However, their skepticism might lead them to dismiss valid medical recommendations. The key is whether the child's needs are being met. If behavioral therapy is sufficient, then the author's approach is valid. But if the child has ADHD and isn't receiving appropriate treatment, it could hinder their development.\n\nI need to weigh the evidence. ADHD is a recognized condition with established diagnostic criteria. If the school psychologist and psychiatrist have evaluated the child and recommended medication, there's a professional consensus. The author's own experience with their child's behavior might not account for all aspects of ADHD, such as impulsivity or inattention in different settings.\n\nThe author is trying to address the problem through behavioral means, which is commendable. However, medication is often a part of a comprehensive treatment plan for ADHD. The author might be denying their son a potentially effective treatment by not following the prescription. But if the diagnosis is incorrect, medication could be unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, but those decisions should ideally be informed by professional medical advice. The author is making a decision based on their own judgment, which is their right, but it's also important to consider the potential consequences of not treating ADHD if it's present.\n\nUltimately, the answer depends on the accuracy of the diagnosis. If the child indeed has ADHD, not providing medication could be a problem. If the diagnosis is wrong, then the author is right to be cautious. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the professionals have suggested ADHD, and the author is disregarding their advice without a strong rationale, there's a risk they're in the wrong. But the author has valid concerns about overdiagnosis and is using alternative methods that are showing some progress. It's a tough call.\n\nIn many cases, a combined approach (medication and therapy) is recommended for ADHD. The author might benefit from seeking a third opinion or a more detailed evaluation to confirm the diagnosis before making a decision. Given that the author hasn't picked up the medication yet and is seeking advice, there's still time to explore a more comprehensive approach. However, as it stands, the author is not necessarily in the wrong but is making a decision that might not be in the child's best interest if the diagnosis is accurate. But since the question is about being in the wrong, it's a matter of whether their decision is justified. The answer could be either A or B, but I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
