I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The parent is concerned about the diagnosis of ADHD and is leaning towards continuing behavioral therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child's school has reported disruptions, but the grades are fine. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the parent sought a second opinion. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the parent hasn't picked it up yet. The parent works in healthcare and is cautious about overdiagnosis and overmedication, especially since the child is improving with therapy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Legally, parents have the right to decide their child's medical treatment. Ethically, it's a balance between the potential benefits of medication and the risks of overmedication. ADHD is a recognized condition, but it's also subject to overdiagnosis. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, which suggests that non-pharmacological approaches might be effective. The parent's stance isn't anti-medication but rather cautious about using drugs when not absolutely necessary. This is a common debate in healthcare circles.\n\nThe parent isn't ignoring the problem; they're actively engaging with therapy. They're also considering a second opinion, which shows they're trying to make an informed decision. The child's age is a factor\u20148 is quite young, and children can exhibit hyperactive behavior without having ADHD. The parent's concern about reliance on medication is valid, as dependency can be an issue.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: if the child does have ADHD, not treating it could lead to long-term issues in school and social situations. But the parent is monitoring progress and hasn't dismissed the possibility; they're just not ready to commit to medication yet. The school's involvement and the therapist's progress indicate that there's a support system in place.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is making a decision based on their child's current progress and their professional experience. They aren't refusing all treatment but prefer a non-drug approach first. Without a definitive diagnosis and given the child's improving behavior, it's reasonable to say the parent isn't in the wrong. So, the answer would be B.\n"
