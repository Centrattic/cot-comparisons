I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The child is described as a class clown with some disruptive behavior at school. The parents have been using cognitive behavioral therapy, which is working slowly. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the parents got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The mother is hesitant, not picking up the prescription, and has concerns about overdiagnosis and overmedication. She works in healthcare, so she's probably informed about medical practices. She's not anti-vax, just cautious about medication when it's not 100% necessary. The husband is more pro-medication.\n\nThe key points here are the child's behavior improving with therapy, the mother's concerns about ADHD being overdiagnosed, and her preference for non-pharmacological approaches. The school psychologist and psychiatrist have different stances, but the mother is taking her time to decide. \n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. It's not just about hyperactivity; the DSM-5 criteria include inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and how these behaviors affect functioning in multiple settings. The mother mentions the child's grades are slightly above average, which might suggest that he's functioning adequately academically, a factor in ADHD diagnosis. However, school disruptions might indicate issues in a structured environment.\n\nThe mother is using behavioral therapy, which is a recommended first-line treatment for ADHD in children, especially when the child is functioning reasonably well. Medication is often considered when behavioral interventions aren't sufficient. However, the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot after a single evaluation, which the mother is skeptical about. The mother's hesitation is based on her healthcare experience and the belief that ADHD is overdiagnosed. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally and ethically, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, including refusing medication, as long as it's not endangering the child. However, if the child's behavior is causing significant impairment and other treatments aren't working, there might be concerns. Here, the child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe the mother is justified in waiting. \n\nAlso, the fact that the psychiatrist prescribed on the spot without thorough evaluation might raise red flags. The mother's desire for a second opinion and her cautious approach could be seen as responsible. However, the father's pro-medication stance is also a consideration. \n\nIn terms of AITA, it's about whether the mother is wrong to refuse medication. Since there's no immediate harm (the child is improving with therapy) and she's actively seeking alternatives, it's possible she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
