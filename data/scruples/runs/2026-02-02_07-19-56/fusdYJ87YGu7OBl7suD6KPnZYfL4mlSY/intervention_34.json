I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old on psychotropic drugs. The situation is that the child is disruptive in school, and the school psychologist thinks he has ADHD, leading to a prescription for Ritalin. The author is hesitant, preferring behavioral therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspects. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication like Ritalin is a common treatment. However, there's debate around overdiagnosis. The author mentions their son's behavior is improving with therapy and that they're in healthcare, so they might have valid concerns about overmedication. \n\nBut wait, the school psychologist and a psychiatrist both suggested medication. The author hasn't even picked up the prescription yet. They want to avoid relying on pills, but if the child's behavior is significantly disruptive and affecting his school life, is it wrong to delay medication? \n\nThe author's stance is cautious. They're not refusing medication entirely but are seeking to address the root causes through therapy. The child's grades are okay, and the behavioral therapy is showing progress. However, the child is in a school environment where the teacher had to send him to the psychologist. If the behavior continues, it might impact his education and social interactions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making an informed decision based on their professional experience. They might be right about ADHD being overdiagnosed. But if the child does have ADHD, not treating it could lead to long-term issues. The parent's approach is cautious and possibly avoiding unnecessary medication, but they might be ignoring expert advice without sufficient reason. \n\nThe answer isn't straightforward. The parent is not in the wrong if they're making an informed decision based on their child's progress in therapy. However, they should be open to further evaluation. The key is whether the child's needs are being met. Since the author is working with a therapist and the child is improving, maybe they're right. But the hesitation to consider medication when it's recommended could be problematic if the child truly needs it. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because they're considering alternative treatments and are cautious about medication. But it's a balance. The answer is B (Not in the wrong) because they're making a thoughtful decision based on their child's progress and their own professional insight, even if they're ignoring some expert opinions. The child is improving with therapy, so it's reasonable to continue that path for now.\n"
