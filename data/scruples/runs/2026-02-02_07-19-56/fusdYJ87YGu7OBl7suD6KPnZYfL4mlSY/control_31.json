I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs despite a school psychologist and psychiatrist's recommendations. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the child is in therapy and showing gradual improvement. The parent works in healthcare and is cautious about overdiagnosis, especially with ADHD. They believe in behavioral therapy over medication unless absolutely necessary. The husband is pro-medication, but the parent is resisting.\n\nOn the other side, the school and a psychiatrist have suggested ADHD, leading to a prescription. The key points here are whether the child's behavior is truly a disorder or just typical childhood behavior. The parent argues that the child's grades are okay, and the disruptive behavior is improving with therapy. They also express concern about overmedication.\n\nADHD is a real condition, but it's often overdiagnosed, as the parent points out. The decision to medicate should involve a thorough evaluation. The parent is seeking alternatives and isn't outright refusing medication but is waiting for a second opinion. The school psychologist's assessment might not be enough; a comprehensive evaluation by a specialist is usually needed. \n\nThe parent's stance isn't anti-medication but cautious. They want to explore non-pharmacological options first, which is a valid approach. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, which supports the parent's choice. However, there's a balance between respecting the parent's judgment and ensuring the child gets appropriate care. If the behavior significantly impacts the child's life and school performance, medication might be necessary. But since the parent is working with professionals and considering alternatives, they aren't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parent is making an informed decision, which they are. They have professional opinions but are not following them immediately, opting for a more conservative approach. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the parent's cautious approach isn't in the wrong.\n"
