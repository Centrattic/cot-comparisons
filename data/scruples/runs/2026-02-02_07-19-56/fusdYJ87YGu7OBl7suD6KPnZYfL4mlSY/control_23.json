I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs, specifically Ritalin, for ADHD. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The son has been acting out in school, labeled a \"class clown,\" and has had multiple disruptions. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the parents got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't filled the prescription yet, preferring to continue with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which is showing slow progress. The husband is pro-medication, while the author is cautious, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed and not wanting the child to rely on pills.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault (AITA). The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI should consider the medical perspective. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication like Ritalin is a standard treatment. However, the author's child has good grades and is improving with therapy. The school psychologist's assessment might be based on a single incident, so maybe the diagnosis isn't fully confirmed. The author is in healthcare, so they might have insights into overprescription, but there's a risk of dismissing valid concerns. Also, getting a second opinion is a responsible step, but the second psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot, which might not be the best practice either. The author is taking a cautious approach, which is common among some parents, especially when they see some progress with non-medical interventions. The child's age is also a factor\u20148 is quite young, and behavior can be part of typical development. The key here is that the author hasn't refused medication outright but is delaying it to see if therapy works. The school's input is important, but parents have the right to make medical decisions for their child. There's no clear consensus on whether medication is necessary here, so the author's choice might not be wrong. On the other hand, if the child's behavior is significantly impacting his school experience, maybe medication is warranted. But since the grades are okay and therapy is showing some progress, the author might be justified in their hesitation. The answer likely leans towards B (No) because parents have the right to consider different treatment options and seek second opinions, especially when the diagnosis is uncertain. It's a complex issue where both sides have valid points, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
