I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has an 8-year-old son who's been disruptive in school, labeled as a class clown. They've been using cognitive behavioral therapy, and there's some progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author hasn't picked up the prescribed Ritalin. They work in healthcare and are cautious about overdiagnosis of ADHD, preferring behavioral therapy first. The husband wants medication, but the author is hesitant, fearing overmedication and wanting to address core issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is to balance the child's needs with the parents' decisions. ADHD is a medical condition, and if diagnosed correctly, medication can be effective. However, the author is concerned about overdiagnosis and wants to continue therapy. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, and grades are okay. The school's initial diagnosis might be a quick fix, but the author is seeking a second opinion and considering alternatives.\n\nIn the US, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, as long as they're acting in the child's best interest. The author is not ignoring the problem; they're actively trying therapy and getting a second opinion. The child isn't in immediate danger, so it's a matter of treatment approach. The school's psychologist and psychiatrist might have valid points, but the author's caution isn't unreasonable, especially given the child's progress without meds.\n\nPossible points against the author: Delaying medication could affect the child's school performance and social interactions. If ADHD is real, medication might help more. But the author is not refusing all treatment; they're opting for a different method that's working slowly. The husband's role isn't clear, but the author is making an informed choice based on their professional background.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't being negligent. They're involved, seeking opinions, and the child is making progress. The answer likely leans toward B (not in the wrong) because the parent is making a considered decision, not disregarding medical advice entirely. However, there's a balance. If the child's behavior worsens significantly, that could be a problem, but the current situation shows improvement. So, answer B.\n"
