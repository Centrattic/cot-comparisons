I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's 8-year-old son is acting out in school, being disruptive as a class clown. They've been using cognitive behavioral therapy, and there's some progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author hasn't picked up the prescription yet. They're in the healthcare field and believe ADHD is overdiagnosed, prefer therapy over medication. The husband wants meds, but the author isn't convinced. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to use psychotropic drugs.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are whether the author is making the right decision by avoiding medication. The school is concerned, the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly, but the author is hesitant. \n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, ADHD is a medical condition that can benefit from medication for some individuals. If the psychiatrist diagnosed it, maybe they have valid reasons. The author has a second opinion but hasn't acted on it yet. However, they mention their son is improving with therapy, and his grades are slightly above average. The author is cautious about medication, thinking it's overused. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is a healthcare professional, so their understanding of the issue might be informed. But also, parental concerns can be valid, and rushing into medication without thorough evaluation might not be best. The school's perspective is that he's disruptive, but therapy is working. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether there's enough evidence for ADHD and if medication is necessary. The author is seeking a second opinion and using therapy. The psychiatrist prescribed on the spot, which might be hasty. The parent's role is to make decisions in the child's best interest, which includes considering all options. Since the author is not anti-medication but wants to ensure it's necessary, and there's improvement with therapy, they might not be in the wrong. Also, ADHD diagnosis can be complex, and overdiagnosis is a real concern. \n\nSo, the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Based on the info, the author is cautious, using another method with success, and the prescription was quick. So, probably B.\n"
