I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation is that the kid is disruptive in school, and after an incident, the school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. They went to a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin, but the author hasn't picked it up yet.\n\nSo, the author is a parent who's hesitant about medication, relying on cognitive behavioral therapy instead. They believe the medication is overused and that behavioral therapy is working. The husband is pro-medication. The author's stance is that they don't want the child to rely on pills and prefer addressing issues at the core.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and medical perspectives. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication can be effective. However, diagnosis can be subjective, and there's debate about overdiagnosis. The parent is in the healthcare field, so they might have valid concerns about overprescription. On the other hand, the school is involved, and there's a recommendation from a professional. \n\nBut the parent is taking a second opinion approach, which is a responsible step. They're not dismissing all medical input but are cautious. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, which is a positive sign. The parent's reasoning is to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary, which could be seen as a reasonable parental choice. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the child genuinely has ADHD, not treating it could lead to long-term issues. But the parent is monitoring the situation and seeing progress with therapy. It's a balance between potential benefits of medication and risks of overmedication. \n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the parent is making an informed decision based on their child's current progress and professional opinions, they might not be in the wrong. However, if there's a clear medical need and the parent is ignoring it, that could be a different case. But here, the parent is taking a cautious approach. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
