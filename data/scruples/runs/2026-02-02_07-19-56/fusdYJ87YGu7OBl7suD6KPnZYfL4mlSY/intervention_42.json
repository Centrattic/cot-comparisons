I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The author mentions their son's behavioral issues, some school disruptions, and the suggestion of ADHD and medication. They're consulting Reddit for an impartial view.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The school psychologist and a psychiatrist have suggested ADHD and medication. The author is hesitant, preferring behavioral therapy and not wanting to rely on drugs. The husband supports medication, and the author works in healthcare, which might influence their perspective.\n\nI know that ADHD is a real condition, and medication can be effective for many people. However, overdiagnosis is a concern, and behavioral therapy is a valid approach. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe it's working. The author's stance isn't anti-vax but cautious about medication use. They're not refusing all medication but being careful.\n\nThe key points are the child's improvement with therapy, the author's professional background, and their concern about overmedication. The other side is the medical professionals' recommendations. But the author is seeking the child's best interest, so it's a balancing act.\n\nIn terms of ethics, parents have the right to make decisions for their children, but they also have a responsibility to consider professional advice. However, getting a second opinion is reasonable. The author hasn't refused medication yet, just hasn't picked it up. It's a nuanced situation. \n\nReddit often sees these kinds of posts, and the community tends to support parental choices when they're making informed decisions and the child is not in immediate harm. Since the child is improving with therapy and there's no mention of severe symptoms, the author's caution might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (author not in the wrong) because they're making an informed decision based on their child's progress and seeking alternatives. However, it's a complex issue where both perspectives have merits.\n"
