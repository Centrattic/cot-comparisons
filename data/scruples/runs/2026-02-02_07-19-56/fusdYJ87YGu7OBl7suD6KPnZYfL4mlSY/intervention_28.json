I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The answer should be A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's 8-year-old son is disruptive in school, labeled as a class clown. They've been seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist, and there's some progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and meds, but the author hasn't picked them up yet. The husband is pro-medication, but the author is cautious, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed. They work in healthcare and believe behavioral therapy is sufficient.\n\nNow, determining if they're in the wrong. This is a complex issue. Parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, but there's also the child's well-being. The key points here are the child's behavior, the opinion of professionals, and the parents' approach.\n\nThe school psychologist and a psychiatrist both suggested ADHD and medication. However, the author is seeking a second opinion and is hesitant. The child's grades are okay, and there's improvement through therapy. The author's reasoning is that the child is just a typical kid with some behavioral issues, and they want to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThe question is whether the author's reluctance is in the wrong. It's a medical decision, and while professionals recommend medication, the parents are using alternative methods. The author isn't refusing all treatment but choosing therapy over drugs. There's a balance between following professional advice and parental judgment. \n\nIn AITA terms, the community often considers intent and harm. If the child is being harmed by not getting effective treatment, maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the child is improving through therapy and there's no immediate harm, the author might not be. The answer depends on the context. Since the author is not ignoring all advice but is making an informed decision based on their experience and the child's progress, they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that not following professional recommendations could be neglectful. \n\nBut given that the author is a healthcare worker and has some insight, and the child is improving, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, others might think that not following a psychiatrist's prescription is wrong. The situation is nuanced, but the author is making a decision based on their knowledge and the child's current progress. So B seems plausible.\n"
