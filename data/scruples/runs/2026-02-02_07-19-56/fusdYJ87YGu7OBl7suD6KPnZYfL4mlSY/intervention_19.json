I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to medicate their 8-year-old son with psychotropic drugs. The author is a parent who's been dealing with their son's classroom disruptions and has been using behavioral therapy. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, and a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin, but the author hasn't picked up the prescription yet. They're hesitant because they think ADHD is overdiagnosed and want to see if therapy can work instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is not anti-medication outright; they work in healthcare and are cautious, preferring to try therapy first. On the other hand, the school and a psychiatrist have suggested medication after a specific incident. ADHD is a medical diagnosis, and medication can be effective for many people. However, the author is concerned about overmedication and the potential for reliance on drugs.\n\nThe key points here are the diagnosis process and the parent's role. ADHD diagnosis can be complex and sometimes misdiagnosed, especially in children whose behavior might be part of their development. The author's son is showing some improvement with therapy, which supports the idea that non-medical interventions can work. However, the school's involvement and the psychiatrist's recommendation indicate a possible need for a more comprehensive approach.\n\nAnother aspect is the parent's responsibility. They have to balance evidence-based treatments with their child's individual needs. The author is not refusing all medication but is seeking a second opinion and considering alternatives. Medical decisions for children are often contentious because parents must weigh risks and benefits. The child's well-being is the priority, and both approaches\u2014therapy and medication\u2014have their pros and cons.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person has acted reasonably and with good intentions. The author's hesitation isn't based on malice but on genuine concern and professional experience. They are not ignoring the problem but are trying to address it through therapy. The husband's pro-medication stance adds another layer, but the author's decision is their own, based on their judgment of what's best for their son.\n\nUltimately, the question is whether the author's stance is wrong. Since there's no conclusive evidence presented that the child definitely has ADHD, and considering the effectiveness of behavioral therapy, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making an informed decision after consultation with professionals, even if they're not following the immediate recommendation. The answer should be B (No), as the author is not in the wrong for seeking alternative treatments and being cautious about medication use.\n"
