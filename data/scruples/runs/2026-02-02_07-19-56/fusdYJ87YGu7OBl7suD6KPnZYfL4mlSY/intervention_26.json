I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves a child with behavioral issues in school, and there's a recommendation for ADHD medication. The author is hesitant, prefers behavioral therapy, and their husband is pro-medication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The child is getting more attention from the school due to disruptions. A school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the parents got a second opinion where a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't picked up the medication yet. They work in healthcare and are skeptical about overdiagnosis of ADHD. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, though slowly.\n\nNow, the ethical or right/wrong aspect. The question is whether the author is wrong for not following the psychiatrist's recommendation. ADHD is a legitimate condition that can benefit from medication, but it's also overdiagnosed. The author's stance is to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary and to focus on behavioral therapy. They have a valid point about not wanting the child reliant on pills and addressing root causes. However, there's also the concern that if the child actually has ADHD, not treating it could lead to long-term issues, like academic struggles or social problems.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' approach. They did get a second opinion, which is good. The psychiatrist prescribed medication quickly, but the author is taking time to decide. The child's current progress with therapy is a positive sign. But some might argue that if ADHD is present, delaying medication could hinder the child's development. On the other hand, others might support the parent's caution, especially with the potential side effects of ADHD meds.\n\nThe author isn't outright refusing medication; they're delaying it while the therapy continues. They're not ignoring the problem but seeking alternative solutions. Their concern about overmedication is a common debate in parenting and healthcare. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for their cautious approach versus following the medical advice. Since the decision is between the parent and the child's best interest, and there's no clear consensus, it's a gray area. The author's reasoning seems thoughtful and based on their professional experience and the child's gradual improvement. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're making an informed decision considering multiple factors and the child's current progress.\n"
