I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs for possible ADHD. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The child is 8, has been disruptive in school, labeled a class clown, and the school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. The parents went to a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin on the spot, but the mother hasn't picked up the medication yet. She's in the healthcare field, skeptical about overdiagnosis of ADHD, and prefers continued behavioral therapy. The husband is pro-medication.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. To determine that, I should consider factors like the child's well-being, medical guidelines, parental rights, and the evidence presented.\n\nADHD is a medical condition that can affect a child's functioning. However, diagnosis isn't straightforward and requires thorough evaluation. The school psychologist made a suggestion, but the mother sought a second opinion, which is reasonable. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly, but maybe the mother is right to be cautious. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, and his grades are slightly above average. The mother's stance is that he's a typical kid with a bit more hyperactivity and that behavioral therapy is working. She's not anti-medication in general but believes in using it only when necessary.\n\nParental responsibility involves making decisions in the child's best interest. There's no right or wrong here, but rather differing opinions on treatment. The mother is using a cautious approach, which is valid. The school's push for medication and the psychiatrist's quick prescription might reflect a tendency towards overdiagnosis. However, if the child's behavior is indeed affecting his school performance and social interactions, there might be a need for intervention beyond therapy. But since the child is showing improvement with therapy, maybe it's reasonable to continue that path.\n\nThe mother's concern about overmedication is a common debate. The key is whether the decision is based on the child's best interest. The mother is not refusing all medical advice but is seeking a more measured approach. She's also in the healthcare field, so her skepticism might be informed. The father's pro-medication stance could create tension, but the mother's choice isn't necessarily wrong if she's monitoring the child's progress.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical wrong, she's not neglecting the child. Different professionals have different opinions, and without definitive evidence of ADHD, she's not in the wrong. The school's role is to accommodate, and the parents have the right to choose treatment options. So the answer is likely B (no), she's not in the wrong.\n"
