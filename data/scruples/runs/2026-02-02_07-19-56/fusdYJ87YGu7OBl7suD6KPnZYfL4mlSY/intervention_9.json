I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the post: The child is 8 years old, has been acting out in school, and the school psychologist suggested ADHD. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the parent hasn't picked up the medication yet. The parent is a healthcare worker, skeptical of overdiagnosis and prefers behavioral therapy, which the child is already undergoing. The parent is concerned about medicating the child when there's a possibility ADHD isn't the right diagnosis.\n\nNow, considering the question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to evaluate if not starting medication is the wrong choice. ADHD is a medical condition, and professional evaluation suggests the child might have it. However, the parent is getting a second opinion and is cautious. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe medication isn't urgent. The parent's stance isn't against all medication but is cautious about overuse. They're also considering the child's age and the potential for overdiagnosis.\n\nOn one hand, professionals are recommending medication, which could help the child's focus and reduce disruptions. On the other, the parent is taking a conservative approach, which is valid given the potential for overdiagnosis and the child's progress with therapy. The parent isn't ignoring the problem but is exploring alternatives first. The husband's pro-medication stance adds to the conflict, but the parent's decision is based on their own experience and research.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they're seeking a second opinion, considering non-medical interventions first, and are making an informed decision. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
