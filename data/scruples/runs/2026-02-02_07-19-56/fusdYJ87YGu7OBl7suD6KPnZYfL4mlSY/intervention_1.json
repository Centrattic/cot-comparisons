I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent deciding not to put their 8-year-old son on ADHD medication. The school and a psychiatrist recommended it, but the parent is hesitant.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the son has behavior issues at school\u2014class clown, disruptions. They've been in therapy, and there's some progress. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin, but the parent hasn't picked it up yet. The parent is in healthcare and thinks ADHD is overdiagnosed. They prefer behavioral therapy and are concerned about overmedicating.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, ADHD is a medical condition that can be treated with medication, but it's not the only option. The parent is considering other approaches. However, the school and a professional (psychiatrist) have suggested medication. The parent's hesitation might stem from valid concerns about overuse of drugs, but also might be missing a possible legitimate need for treatment.\n\nOn one hand, the parent has valid reasons to be cautious. On the other, if the child's condition is impacting school and social life, maybe medication could help. But the therapy is working slowly. The parent isn't ignoring the problem; they're seeking alternatives. It's a balance between medical advice and personal judgment. The question is whether not following the psychiatrist's advice makes them wrong. Since the parent is not anti-medication but wants to explore other options, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the child truly needs medication and the parent is delaying it, that could be an issue. But the parent believes it's not necessary. So, it's a tough call. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent is making an informed decision based on their own research and experience, even if it's different from the professionals' recommendations.\n"
