I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The son is 8, acting out in school, labeled as a troublemaker. The school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication. The parents get a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribes Ritalin. The author is against medication, works in healthcare, and prefers behavioral therapy since their son is showing slow improvement. The husband is pro-medication. The author is seeking reassurance they're not in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the options. The author is a parent making a decision about their child's treatment. ADHD diagnosis can be controversial, and medication isn't the only approach. The author is using therapy and has seen some progress. They're cautious about medication, which is a valid stance. The other parent (husband) is in favor, but the author is making a choice based on their judgment. \n\nIn terms of rights, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, as long as they're not endangering the child. The author isn't refusing all treatment; they're choosing an alternative path. The key is whether their approach is reasonable. Since there's no evidence of harm from delaying medication and the son is showing some improvement, the author's caution isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the behavior is significantly impacting the child's education or well-being, there might be a duty to consider medication. But the author is concerned about overdiagnosis and reliance on drugs, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks for malicious intent or harm. The author's actions are driven by a desire to avoid unnecessary medication and address the root causes. There's no indication they're harming the child. The husband's perspective is also valid, but the author isn't compelled to follow his advice. \n\nSo, based on the information, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). The author is making a responsible decision based on their values and the child's current progress, even if others disagree. There's no clear evidence of wrongdoing here.\n"
