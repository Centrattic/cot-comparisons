I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong regarding not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The author's son is 8 years old, and there's been some behavioral issues at school, leading to a recommendation for ADHD medication. The author is resisting medication, preferring behavioral therapy, while the husband is more in favor of meds.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from different angles. The school reported disruptions, and the psychologist suggested ADHD with medication. But the author's son's grades are fine, slightly above average, and he's making progress in therapy. The author is in healthcare, so they have some knowledge. They mention that ADHD is overdiagnosed and that they don't want their son reliant on pills. The husband got a psychiatrist to prescribe Ritalin on the spot, but the author hasn't picked it up yet.\n\nNow, considering the options. Is the author wrong for not wanting medication? Well, ADHD diagnosis in children can be tricky. It's possible that the behavior is age-appropriate or that the therapy is working. The author's concern about overdiagnosis and overmedication is valid to some extent. However, ADHD is a legitimate condition, and medication can be effective. But the author is not dismissing the problem entirely; they're just cautious. They are giving behavioral therapy a chance, which is a valid approach as well.\n\nThe key points are: the child is improving with therapy, the author is making an informed decision based on their professional background, and the husband's push for medication contrasts with the author's more cautious approach. The author is not denying the issue but is seeking a non-pharmacological solution first. There's no indication that the child's behavior is harmful beyond typical classroom disruptions. The school's role is to manage behavior, and maybe the author is right that therapy is sufficient here.\n\nOn the other hand, if the child does have ADHD and isn't treated, there could be long-term consequences. But the author is not ignoring the problem; they're just choosing a different path. The question is about being in the wrong. Since the author is making an informed choice, considering alternatives, and not withholding care entirely, it's more about a difference in opinion rather than being wrong. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). However, it's important to note that both medication and therapy can be part of a treatment plan, and the author's stance isn't necessarily incorrect, especially when there's evidence that therapy is working.\n"
