I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author has a son who's been a troublemaker in school, often disrupting class as a class clown. They've been using cognitive behavioral therapy, and the kid is making slow progress. The school psychologist thinks he might have ADHD and recommends medication. The husband goes to a psychiatrist who prescribes Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked up the prescription yet. The author is a healthcare worker and is skeptical about ADHD diagnoses, believing it's overdiagnosed. They think the kid's behavior is manageable with therapy and don't want him on meds unless absolutely necessary.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the key points. ADHD is a real condition, and medication can help some children. However, the author is not dismissive; they're taking the child to therapy and seeing some improvement. They also got a second opinion. The school psychologist and psychiatrist both suggested medication, but the author is cautious. \n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky, especially in young kids. Kids are naturally active and sometimes disruptive. The author mentions the son's grades are slightly above average, which might indicate that the ADHD isn't severely impacting academic performance. The therapist is making progress, which suggests that non-medical interventions are working. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a professional opinion suggesting that medication is the best route. The husband is pro-medication, but the author is taking a more cautious approach. The author isn't anti-medication but wants to avoid overuse. \n\nThe key here is the balance between professional advice and parental judgment. The author isn't ignoring the situation; they're engaging in therapy, getting second opinions, and considering the child's well-being. The school is involved, which is important. The author's reasoning is that medication should be a last resort, and they're not dismissing the possibility of ADHD but are cautious about jumping to medication. \n\nIn such cases, there isn't a clear right or wrong. However, the author is not violating any laws or unethical practices by not proceeding with medication immediately. They are seeking alternatives and are actively involved in their child's care. The school psychologist's recommendation might be valid, but the author's approach is also reasonable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they are making an informed decision based on their child's current progress and their own professional insight. They are not ignoring the problem but are taking a measured approach. The answer should be B.\n"
