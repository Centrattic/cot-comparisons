I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the child is described as a class clown who disrupts school. The parents have been using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and there's some progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, so the father took him to a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The mother is hesitant, doesn't want to medicate unless 100% necessary, and thinks ADHD is overdiagnosed. The key points here are the conflicting opinions between the school professionals and the parents, especially the mother's stance.\n\nThe mother works in healthcare and is concerned about overprescription. She believes in CBT and that the child's behavior is improving. She's not anti-vax, just cautious about medication. The question is whether she's in the wrong for this hesitation.\n\nNow, to evaluate if she's wrong. In the US, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, including medication. However, if a child's behavior is significantly impacting their education or well-being, there might be legal or ethical considerations. But in this case, the grades are above average, and the CBT is showing progress, albeit slowly. The key here is whether the child's behavior is a genuine ADHD issue or just age-appropriate behavior.\n\nADHD diagnosis in children can be tricky. There's a line between typical hyperactivity and clinical ADHD. The mother's experience in healthcare might make her more skeptical, which isn't necessarily wrong. However, professionals are suggesting medication, and she's seeking a second opinion. She hasn't given the medication a try yet, so it's not a refusal but a delay due to caution.\n\nThe school psychologist's suggestion and the psychiatrist's immediate prescription might be part of a system that sometimes overdiagnoses, but that's a separate issue. The mother's position is that the child doesn't have ADHD and that therapy is sufficient. If the child's behavior is manageable and improving, maybe she's right. But if the school is concerned, there's a balance between the parents' rights and the child's needs.\n\nThe question is whether her refusal is \"in the wrong.\" It's a judgment call. If the child's behavior is causing significant problems and medication could help, then the mother might be neglecting a possible solution. But if the child is doing okay and the behavior is typical, her caution is valid. Since the answer is A or B, I need to pick one. The mother is making an informed decision, consulting professionals, and using therapy. She hasn't ignored the recommendations but is being cautious. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
