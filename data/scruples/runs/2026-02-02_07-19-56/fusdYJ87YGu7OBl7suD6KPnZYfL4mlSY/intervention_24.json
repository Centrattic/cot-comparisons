I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs for possible ADHD. The other parent, the husband, is pro-medication, and they got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author is against it, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed and that behavior therapy is working slowly but effectively. The school reported a big disruption, which led to the school psychologist suggesting medication. The author works in healthcare and is concerned about overmedication.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author's arguments are that the child's behavior is improving with therapy, his grades are okay, and they don't want to rely on drugs unless absolutely necessary. They also mention seeing psychiatrists write scripts quickly. On the other hand, the school is involved, there's a second opinion from a psychiatrist, and the husband thinks medication is the best route. The key here is whether the author is wrong in refusing medication despite the professional suggestions.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. It's a medical condition, and if a child meets the criteria, medication like Ritalin can be effective. However, the author is skeptical of overdiagnosis and overmedication. They believe in addressing the root causes with therapy. The school's involvement is a factor\u2014teachers and principals are trained to handle different behaviors, and if they're concerned, that's a red flag. The author's own child is described as a class clown and troublemaker, which might align with ADHD symptoms but could also be typical behavior for a kid.\n\nThe author is in a healthcare field but isn't a psychiatrist. They might have some insight, but they're not the medical professional making the diagnosis. The psychiatrist's second opinion is significant, but the author hasn't acted on it. The husband's stance is pro-medication, which adds conflict. The author's concern about dependency is valid, but so is the potential need for medication if ADHD is present.\n\nIt's a balance between medical advice and parental intuition. The question is whether the author is wrong not to follow the psychiatrist's recommendation. If the author is withholding necessary treatment, they could be wrong. But if ADHD is overdiagnosed and the child is improving with therapy, they might be right. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances of the child's behavior and whether the therapy is sufficient.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. The author is a parent making a decision based on their own beliefs and observations, but they are disregarding a professional's recommendation. However, they have their own reasons and are using therapy. It's a tough call. In a medical sense, following the psychiatrist's advice might be the correct path, but parental choice in treatment is also important. The author might not be in the wrong if they're making an informed decision based on their child's progress. But if the psychiatrist's diagnosis is valid, then the author could be neglecting necessary treatment. Since the author is in healthcare, they might have more knowledge but are still choosing against medication. It's possible they are not in the wrong because they have valid reasons and the child is improving, but it's a complex issue without clear right or wrong. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they are making a conscious, informed choice and the child's behavior is improving, even if others disagree.\n"
