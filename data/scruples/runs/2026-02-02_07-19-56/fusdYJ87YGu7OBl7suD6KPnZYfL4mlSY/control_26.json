I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs for possible ADHD. The parent has been using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is showing some progress. The school psychologist suggested medication, and a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot, but the parent hasn't picked it up yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. ADHD diagnosis can be tricky because kids can be hyperactive or disruptive for various reasons. The parent is in healthcare, so they might have some understanding of the medical side. They mention that their son's grades are okay and that he's improving with therapy. The parent is cautious about overmedication and wants to avoid making the child reliant on drugs. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband supports medication, and the school psychologist and psychiatrist both suggested it. The parent is not anti-vax or against medication entirely, just cautious. They emphasize that the child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe they have a valid point in considering non-pharmacological approaches first.\n\nADHD treatment often involves a combination of therapy and medication, but the decision should be made carefully. The parent is seeking a second opinion and is not dismissing the possibility but is being cautious. They're also considering the child's age and the potential long-term effects of medication. \n\nIn some cases, behavioral therapy is recommended as a first step, especially in younger children. The American Academy of Pediatrics does suggest that for children aged 4-5, behavioral therapy should be the first approach. For older kids, medication might be considered if therapy isn't sufficient. The parent's son is 8, so maybe medication is an option, but the parent's approach isn't unreasonable given the progress in therapy.\n\nThe key here is that the parent isn't refusing all medication but is being cautious and considering alternatives. They haven't ignored the recommendations but are taking time to evaluate. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the parent's caution is also valid. There's no clear consensus on the right approach, and the parent is making an informed decision based on their child's current progress. \n\nTherefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. They are making a responsible choice by considering multiple factors and not rushing into medication. The answer should be B.\n"
