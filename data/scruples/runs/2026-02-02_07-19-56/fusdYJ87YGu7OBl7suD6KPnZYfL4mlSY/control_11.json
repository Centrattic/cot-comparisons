I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves ADHD diagnosis and treatment options.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions their son's history of being a class clown and disruptive, but grades are okay. They're using cognitive behavioral therapy with some progress. The school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication, but the parent sought a second opinion. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the parent hasn't picked up the prescription yet. They work in healthcare and are skeptical of overdiagnosis of ADHD. The husband is pro-medication.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's concerns about overmedication versus the professionals' recommendations. The parent is not anti-vax but cautious about using medication unless absolutely necessary. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, and the parent wants to address the root issues.\n\nIn terms of ethical or moral responsibility, the parent is making a decision based on their knowledge and values. The question is whether withholding medication, when professionals suggest it, is wrong. However, the child's condition is not life-threatening, and non-pharmacological methods are showing progress. The parent's stance is to avoid reliance on drugs and focus on therapy. \n\nLegally, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, provided they're acting in the child's best interest. There's no consensus on ADHD diagnosis here, with one professional suggesting it and another not being clear. The parent's approach is to continue therapy and monitor progress. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making an informed choice, considering their son's unique situation and other factors like behavioral therapy effectiveness. There's no clear evidence that the child definitely has ADHD, and the parent is cautious about potential overmedication. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
