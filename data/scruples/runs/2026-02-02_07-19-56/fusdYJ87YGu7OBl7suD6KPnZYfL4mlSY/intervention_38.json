I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who refuses to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic medication is in the wrong. The situation involves a child with behavioral issues at school, and while therapy is helping, a school psychologist suggested ADHD medication. Another psychiatrist immediately prescribed Ritalin, but the parent hasn't picked it up yet.\n\nFirst, the parent is against medicating unless absolutely necessary. They work in healthcare and are skeptical about overdiagnosis of ADHD. They see behavioral therapy as effective, even if slow. Their stance is that the child is a typical kid and that medication should be a last resort.\n\nNow, considering the parent's reasoning: they value non-pharmacological approaches and are cautious about medication. They mention the child's improvement with therapy and are concerned about dependency. On the other hand, the school and professionals are pushing for medication, which might indicate that they see a need for intervention. However, the parent is seeking a second opinion and is not dismissing the possibility entirely\u2014they're just not convinced yet.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is ADHD overdiagnosed? The parent's healthcare background might inform their skepticism. However, ADHD is a legitimate medical condition, and medication can be effective. The school's concern is about the child's behavior affecting learning and others. But the child's grades are above average, so maybe the issue is more about classroom management than academic performance.\n\nIs the parent's approach valid? Behavioral therapy is a good start, and it's true that not every case requires medication. However, if the child's behavior is significantly disruptive and the school is involved, there's a balance between the child's needs and the educational environment. The parent's decision isn't malicious; they're trying to explore all options and avoid unnecessary medication.\n\nBut could there be a risk in delaying medication? If the child has ADHD and is struggling, untreated ADHD can have long-term effects. However, the parent isn't ignoring the issue\u2014they're using therapy and considering other options. The key here is whether the parent is making an informed decision based on their child's specific needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents should consider professional advice but also have the right to make decisions based on their knowledge and values. Since the child's behavior is improving with therapy, the parent's approach might be reasonable. However, if the situation worsens, they might need to reconsider medication.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent isn't refusing treatment outright; they're choosing a different path. Given that they're consulting professionals and not ignoring the problem, it's a balanced approach. Their concern about overmedication is valid in a broader societal context. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they're making an informed, cautious decision rather than refusing all treatment.\n"
