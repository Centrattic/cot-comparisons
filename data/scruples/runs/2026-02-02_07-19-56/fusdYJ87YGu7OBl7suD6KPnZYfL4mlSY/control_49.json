I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The author is a parent with three kids, and the son is described as a class clown who disrupts school. They've been using cognitive behavioral therapy and are seeing some progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author is hesitant. They got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked it up yet.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't think the son has ADHD, believe ADHD is overdiagnosed, and prefer behavioral therapy. They work in healthcare and are wary of quick prescriptions. The husband is pro-medication, leading to some conflict. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and medical aspects. ADHD diagnosis can be complex. It's not just about hyperactivity but also attention issues, impulsivity, and how it affects daily functioning. The author mentions that the child's grades are slightly above average and that he's improving with therapy. However, the school is involved, and there's been some significant disruptions. \n\nOn one hand, the author is cautious, seeking a second opinion and relying on therapy. They have valid concerns about overmedication, which is a real issue. On the other hand, if the child truly has ADHD, untreated symptoms could affect his academic performance, social interactions, and self-esteem in the long term. The school psychologist and psychiatrist have both suggested medication, which might indicate that the symptoms are significant enough to warrant intervention beyond therapy.\n\nThe key points are the diagnosis's accuracy and the effectiveness of the current treatment. The author is in a position where they have professional insight but also personal bias against medication. The husband's stance is more in favor of medication. The question is whether the author is wrong for resisting medication when professionals are recommending it. \n\nIt's important to note that parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, if the child is struggling in school and the therapy isn't addressing all the issues, there might be a duty to consider all options, including medication, if the problem is impacting his well-being. The author's approach might be reasonable, but there's a risk of underestimating the condition if it is ADHD. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the child's behavior is just typical childhood behavior or a genuine disorder requiring treatment. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong, but they might need to gather more information, perhaps a third opinion, or combine therapy with monitoring the child's progress. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's the best next step. \n\nGiven the information, the author is not in the wrong for being cautious and prioritizing non-pharmacological approaches, especially with the child showing some improvement. However, they should remain open to professional evaluations and ensure that their decision is in the child's best interest. The answer is B.\n"
