I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The son is 8 years old, has been acting out in school, but is showing improvement with CBT. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, and a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately. The parent is hesitant, thinks ADHD is overdiagnosed, and prefers non-medication approaches. The husband is pro-medication, and they had a spat about it. The key points are whether the child truly has ADHD, the effectiveness of the current therapy, and the parent's stance on medication.\n\nThe parent works in healthcare, so they might have some knowledge about overprescription. They mention their son's behavior is improving with therapy. The child's grades are slightly above average, which might not align with typical ADHD symptoms. The parent is not anti-vax, just cautious about medication for ADHD. \n\nNow, the question is if they're in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider if the parent is ignoring a possible real issue. ADHD is a legitimate diagnosis, and if the child meets the criteria, medication can be effective. However, the parent is using behavioral therapy and sees progress. The school's assessment might be one opinion, but getting a second opinion is reasonable. The parent isn't dismissing the problem entirely but is taking a cautious approach. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if ADHD is affecting school performance and the medication is a viable solution, not considering it could be neglecting treatment. But the parent is actively addressing the issue with therapy. It's a balance between the risks of medication and alternative approaches. Since the child is improving with therapy, maybe it's not the parent's fault to be cautious. Also, the initial psychiatrist prescribed quickly, which the parent is skeptical of. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because they're seeking second opinions, using therapy, and considering the long-term effects of medication. Their approach is cautious and involves professional input. The answer is B.\n"
