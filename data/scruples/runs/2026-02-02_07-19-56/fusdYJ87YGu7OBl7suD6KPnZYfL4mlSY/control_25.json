I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The context provided is from a Reddit post where the parent, let's call them Parent A, is seeking advice. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Parent A's son has been acting out in school, labeled as a class clown, and there's been a significant incident where he disrupted a music class. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. Parent A's husband got a prescription for Ritalin from a psychiatrist, but Parent A hasn't picked it up yet. They prefer behavioral therapy, which is showing slow progress. Parent A works in healthcare and is skeptical about overdiagnosis and overmedication, especially for ADHD. They believe the child's behavior is age-appropriate and that therapy can address the issues without drugs.\n\nNow, the question is whether Parent A is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To determine this, I need to consider various angles.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, ADHD is a recognized condition. If a child is diagnosed correctly, medication can be effective. However, there's also controversy around overdiagnosis and the appropriate use of stimulant medications. The school psychologist and psychiatrist have made assessments, but Parent A is seeking a second opinion and is cautious. \n\nParent A has a valid point about the potential overuse of medication. They mention that their son's behavior is improving with therapy and that his academic performance is above average, which might not strongly indicate ADHD. The child's behavior is described as typical for his age, which could mean that the disruption is part of normal development rather than a disorder.\n\nOn the other hand, if the child does have ADHD, not treating it could lead to long-term academic and social difficulties. However, the parent is not dismissing the possibility entirely; they're just advocating for more time with therapy. The husband is more in favor of medication, which is a common perspective, but the parent's hesitation isn't unreasonable, especially given their healthcare background.\n\nEthically, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, provided they aren't endangering the child. The key here is whether the parent is withholding necessary treatment. If the child indeed has ADHD and medication is the standard treatment, then not pursuing it could be seen as neglect. However, if the diagnosis isn't certain and therapy is working, then the parent's caution is justified.\n\nThe parent's argument is that the child isn't showing severe symptoms that require medication immediately. They're giving therapy time, which is a reasonable approach. The school's push for medication might be influenced by their own needs (managing classroom behavior), not just the child's best interest.\n\nIn the US, parents can choose alternative treatments, and there's no legal obligation to medicate unless there's a court order. Since the child's behavior isn't causing immediate harm and there's a viable non-medication approach, the parent isn't in the wrong for seeking a non-pharmacological route. The decision is also influenced by the parent's professional experience, which adds credibility to their skepticism.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are making an informed decision based on their child's progress and concerns about overmedication, which is a legitimate stance. They aren't ignoring the problem but are opting for a slower, non-drug approach while monitoring the situation.\n"
