I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves a child with possible ADHD, school disruptions, and differing opinions between the parents.\n\nFirst, the school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author is skeptical. They got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't picked up the prescription yet, preferring behavioral therapy. Their reasoning includes concerns about overdiagnosis and reliance on medication, and they mention their experience in healthcare.\n\nThe question is whether this decision is wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is cautious about medication and is exploring behavioral therapy, which is a valid approach. On the other hand, the school and a psychiatrist are recommending medication, which might be necessary for ADHD management.\n\nADHD is a recognized condition, and medication can be effective. However, the author has a valid point about overdiagnosis. The child's grades are above average, and behavior is improving with therapy. The author is not anti-medication but wants to avoid unnecessary use. The husband's pro-medication stance contrasts with the author's approach.\n\nIt's important to note that the author is seeking the child's best interest and using professional opinions. Without more information, it's hard to say definitively if the author is wrong. They are making an informed decision based on their observations and concerns. The key here is that there's no one-size-fits-all answer in ADHD treatment. Both medication and therapy have their roles. The author's cautious approach, while different from the psychiatrist's recommendation, isn't inherently wrong if it's based on a balanced consideration of evidence and the child's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author is making a thoughtful decision considering both professional advice and their own judgment, which is reasonable given the complexity of ADHD diagnosis and treatment options.\n"
