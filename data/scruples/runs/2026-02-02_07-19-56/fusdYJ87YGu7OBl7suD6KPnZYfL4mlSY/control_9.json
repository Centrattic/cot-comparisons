I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent deciding not to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic medication for potential ADHD, despite a psychiatrist's recommendation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The parent is a healthcare worker, so they have some professional insight. They mention that their son's behavior is improving with cognitive behavioral therapy and that his grades are okay. They're concerned about overdiagnosis and overmedication, especially since ADHD is sometimes seen as being overdiagnosed. The other parent (the husband) is pro-medication, and the school psychologist suggested medication. \n\nADHD is a real condition that can benefit from medication, but there's also validity in the parent's caution. The key here is whether the author is wrong for not following the psychiatrist's prescription.\n\nThe parent isn't anti-medication in general, just cautious. They value behavioral therapy and want to avoid dependency. The child's behavior is improving without meds, which supports their approach. However, ADHD can impact a child's life significantly, so if it's confirmed, medication might be necessary. But the parent hasn't ruled out a second opinion or more thorough evaluation beyond the first psychiatrist's visit. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. From a medical standpoint, the psychiatrist's recommendation is based on their assessment, but the parent is seeking alternative views and has a valid reason based on their own experience. Since the child is responding to therapy, maybe the parent isn't wrong to be cautious. Also, the parent is not refusing treatment entirely but considering other options. \n\nIn many cases, a balanced approach is recommended\u2014using a combination of therapy and medication if needed. The parent isn't refusing all treatment but is being proactive in seeking what they believe is best for their child. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're making an informed decision based on their child's current progress and their own concerns about overmedication.\n"
