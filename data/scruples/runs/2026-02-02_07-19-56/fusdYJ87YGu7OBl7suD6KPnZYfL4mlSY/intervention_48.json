I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves the child being labeled as a troublemaker in school, with a school psychologist suggesting ADHD and medication. The parents got a second opinion, but the author hasn't picked up the prescription yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is a parent who is cautious about medication, especially for ADHD, which they believe is overdiagnosed. They're using behavioral therapy and see some improvement. Their husband is more in favor of medication. The author works in healthcare, so they have some professional insight.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on several factors. Legally, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, so they aren't in legal trouble. Ethically, it's more nuanced. ADHD is a medical condition that can affect a child's learning and social interactions. Medication can be effective for some, but it's not the only solution. The author is considering non-pharmacological approaches, which are valid and supported in many cases.\n\nThe school psychologist and psychiatrist are professionals recommending medication, but the author is seeking a second opinion and is cautious. They mention that the child's grades are fine and that his behavior is improving with therapy. This suggests that the child might not need medication, especially if behavioral interventions are working. However, there's a risk that without medication, the child might struggle in school more, leading to other issues. On the other hand, medicating without a clear diagnosis could have side effects and the author's concern about overmedication is valid.\n\nThe author is not ignoring the problem; they're actively engaged in therapy. Their stance is about being cautious and not rushing to medication. The husband's perspective is also considered, as he's in favor of the medication. The author's healthcare background might give them a different perspective, but it's still a parent's judgment call.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether they're neglecting the child's needs. Since they're taking steps with therapy and considering all options, it's hard to say they're wrong. However, there's a potential risk if the child's ADHD is indeed impacting his school performance and social interactions. The author's decision is based on their judgment that medication isn't necessary yet, given the progress in therapy.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're making an informed decision based on their child's current progress and their own concerns about medication. They are not dismissing the issue but are exploring alternatives. However, it's a close call because there's a risk of missing a valid medical need. But given the information provided, the author's approach is reasonable.\n"
