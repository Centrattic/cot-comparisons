I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parent mentions that their son has been acting out in school, classified as a \"class clown\" and causing disruptions. They've been using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which is showing slow progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, and a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot. The author hasn't picked up the medication yet, preferring a wait-and-see approach with therapy, while the husband is more pro-medication. The author works in healthcare and believes ADHD is overdiagnosed, and they don't want the child reliant on drugs.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the factors here.\n\nFirst, the child's behavior is leading to multiple calls from school, indicating significant disruption. The school's recommendation is based on a psychologist's assessment pointing toward ADHD. The psychiatrist also prescribed medication quickly. However, the parent is hesitant, thinking the diagnosis might be overdone and that non-medical interventions are working, albeit slowly.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, ADHD is diagnosed through specific criteria, including inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The parent notes the child's grades are slightly above average, which might suggest that academic performance isn't severely impacted, a possible counterpoint to ADHD. But school disruptions are still concerning.\n\nThe key here is balancing the potential benefits of medication against the risks. The parent is advocating for a conservative approach, using behavioral therapy which is a standard first-line treatment for ADHD. However, the school's involvement and the psychiatrist's recommendation suggest that the medical community is leaning towards a diagnosis where medication is considered necessary.\n\nBut the parent is not dismissing all medical advice; they sought a second opinion. The hesitation is based on personal experience in healthcare, observing that psychiatrists might prescribe medication too quickly. The parent's concern is valid, as ADHD can sometimes be overdiagnosed, especially in children who are naturally energetic or have behavioral issues without a disorder.\n\nHowever, the school's repeated interventions and the child's disruptive behavior might indicate a need for more immediate solutions. The parent is choosing to continue with therapy, which is effective for many children with ADHD, but there's a risk that without medication, the behavior might persist and affect the child's education and social skills.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's caution is understandable. Medication has side effects, and for a child who hasn't been thoroughly evaluated, it's prudent to explore alternatives first. The fact that the child is improving slowly with therapy supports the parent's approach. However, the psychiatrist's quick prescription might not have involved a comprehensive evaluation, so the parent's second opinion is a good step.\n\nThe parent isn't refusing medication entirely; they're just not picking it up yet. That leaves room for further assessment. The question is whether withholding medication is harmful. If the child doesn't have ADHD, the medication could be unnecessary. But if the diagnosis is correct, delaying treatment might exacerbate issues.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents have a duty to seek the best interests of their child. The parent is considering multiple sources of advice and choosing a therapy-first approach. This isn't inconsiderate, but it could be seen as not addressing the problem as urgently as the school and medical professionals recommend. But the parent's reasoning is based on valid concerns about overmedication and wanting to solve the root cause.\n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the parent's approach is negligent. Since they're actively seeking therapy and haven't dismissed the possibility of medication entirely, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the school is involved and the situation is affecting the child's learning, there's a counterargument that the parent isn't addressing the problem sufficiently.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is taking a cautious, evidence-based approach with behavioral therapy, which is appropriate. Their hesitation to start medication without further evaluation is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
