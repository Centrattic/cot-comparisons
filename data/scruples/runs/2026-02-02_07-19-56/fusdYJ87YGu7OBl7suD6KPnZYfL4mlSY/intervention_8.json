I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves an 8-year-old with some behavioral issues in school, and professionals are suggesting ADHD medication. The author is hesitant, prefers behavioral therapy, and the husband is more in favor of medication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The child is 8, has been acting out in school, but his grades are okay. He's been in therapy and showing improvement. The school psychologist thinks ADHD, and a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin. The author hasn't picked up the medication yet, thinking that ADHD is overdiagnosed and wants to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, the key points: The author is not anti-vax, works in healthcare, and has a valid concern about overprescription. They believe in non-medical interventions like behavioral therapy, which is working slowly. The husband is more pro-medication. The author is worried about long-term reliance on pills and wants to address root causes.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, especially if they have valid concerns. ADHD is controversial in terms of diagnosis, and there's evidence that behavioral therapy can work. The child is improving with therapy, so maybe medication isn't urgent. However, there's a risk of delaying treatment if the child actually has ADHD. But the author is not refusing treatment entirely, just delaying in favor of more alternatives.\n\nThe ethical angle is balancing the child's needs with parental choice. The author is considering the child's best interest, albeit with some skepticism about ADHD. The school's role is also important, but the parent's decision isn't entirely against professional advice\u2014it's a second opinion after a quick prescription.\n\nSo, in terms of fault, it's a judgment call. The author isn't ignoring all medical advice; they're seeking alternatives and have valid points. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
