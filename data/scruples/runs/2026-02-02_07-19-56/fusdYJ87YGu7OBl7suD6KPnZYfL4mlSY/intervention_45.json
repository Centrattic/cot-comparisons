I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe son is described as a troublemaker in school, especially as the \"class clown\" who disrupts. The parents have him in cognitive behavioral therapy, and he's making slow but some progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication (Ritalin) because of a recent incident where he played his own song in music class instead of following instructions. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked up the prescription. The husband is pro-medication, but the author is cautious, working in healthcare and believing ADHD is overdiagnosed. They think therapy can fix the behavior over time and don't want the child to rely on pills.\n\nFirst, I should consider the medical perspective. ADHD is a recognized condition with specific diagnostic criteria. If a child is having significant behavioral issues that affect learning and social interactions, medication can be an effective part of treatment. The school psychologist and psychiatrist both think it's likely ADHD. However, the author is skeptical, possibly due to personal beliefs or professional experience. There's a debate over overdiagnosis and overmedication, especially in children. But is that a valid reason to ignore a possible legitimate medical need?\n\nThe son's grades are okay, but the issue is school disruptions. The teacher was frustrated, and the principal referred to the psychologist. The author might be right if the behavior is just typical childhood and the child is improving with therapy. But if it's a genuine ADHD case, medication could help manage symptoms more effectively, especially if behavioral interventions aren't sufficient. The author's approach could be seen as neglecting a potential need, but also as being cautious to avoid unnecessary medication.\n\nI should also think about the parent's role. Parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, but they also have a responsibility to seek effective treatment. The author is using an alternative approach (CBT) and is not dismissing the possibility of ADHD entirely but is seeking a second opinion. However, the psychiatrist already provided a second opinion and prescribed medication. The author hasn't followed up on that. Is that a problem? Maybe the author should consider more evidence-based approaches, but how much weight should be given to their skepticism?\n\nThere's a risk of the child's behavior worsening if ADHD is present and not treated. On the other hand, starting medication too soon without thorough evaluation might not be ideal. The author's concern about overmedication is valid in some contexts, but so is the concern about untreated ADHD affecting the child's life.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents should ideally discuss all options with a qualified professional, ensure a proper diagnosis, and consider a holistic approach, including both therapy and medication if appropriate. The author's refusal to pick up the prescription without further consultation could be seen as not following medical advice, but maybe they are just being cautious. The key points are the child's well-being, the effectiveness of the current treatment, and the possibility that medication could help. The author might be in the right if the child's issues are manageable without medication, but if there's a real need they're ignoring, that's a different story. The situation is complex, and without more info, it's hard to say. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they're considering all options and the child is showing improvement. However, if the child's behavior is significantly impairing his education or social life, not pursuing medication when recommended might be a problem. So I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they are seeking alternative methods and have a valid concern about overmedication, but it's a close call.\n"
