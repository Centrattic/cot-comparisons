I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves the child's behavior at school, a school psychologist suggesting ADHD and medication, and the author's hesitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical perspective. ADHD diagnosis can be complex and sometimes overdiagnosed. The school psychologist made a suggestion, but the author got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin. However, the author hasn't picked up the medication yet. The parent is in the healthcare field, which might give them some insight, but they also acknowledge not being anti-vax or against medication in general. They prefer behavioral therapy, which is making progress, albeit slowly.\n\nNow, the key points are: the child's behavior is improving with therapy, the author is cautious about medication, and there's a debate between using medication versus behavioral approaches. The husband is pro-medication, but the parent is not convinced of the ADHD diagnosis. The author emphasizes not wanting the child to rely on pills for \"every little thing.\"\n\nEthically, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, especially when there's a professional disagreement. The child's well-being is the priority. The author isn't outright refusing all medical advice but is seeking a second opinion and considering non-pharmacological methods. They also mention the child's grades are slightly above average, which doesn't align with severe ADHD symptoms.\n\nPotential arguments against the author could be that delaying medication might hinder the child's academic progress or social interactions if ADHD is indeed a factor. However, the author is monitoring the situation and the child is showing improvement with therapy. The decision to start medication should ideally involve a thorough evaluation and consensus among professionals, which might not have happened yet.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is cautious, which is reasonable given the potential side effects of stimulant medications and the importance of addressing behavioral issues through therapy first. The parent's concern about overdiagnosis and overmedication is a valid societal concern. They are not dismissing the problem but are taking a measured approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They are making an informed decision based on their child's current progress and their own medical knowledge. It's a complex situation where different approaches have pros and cons. The parent's responsibility is to act in the child's best interest, and they are doing so by considering multiple factors and opinions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
