I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The author's son is 8 years old, has been acting out in school, but grades are okay. They've been in therapy, which is helping slowly. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, then a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin. The author is hesitant, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed and prefers therapy. The husband is pro-medication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and medical perspectives. ADHD diagnosis can be tricky. Symptoms like being a class clown and disruptive behavior don't automatically mean ADHD. The author works in healthcare, so they might have some knowledge about overprescription. On the other hand, professionals (psychologist, psychiatrist) are making recommendations based on their assessment. The key points are whether the author is ignoring expert advice or if their hesitation is reasonable.\n\nThe author's stance isn't anti-medication but cautious. They believe in addressing the root cause through therapy. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe medication isn't urgent. However, there's a risk of not treating ADHD if it's actually present\u2014could affect his school, social skills, etc. But the author argues that it's overdiagnosed and that the kid is just a typical hyperactive kid.\n\nI should check if there's a consensus on ADHD treatment. Typically, ADHD management can include both medication and behavioral therapy. Some cases require medication for effectiveness. But if the child is improving with therapy alone, maybe it's a valid approach. Also, the author is the parent and has the right to make decisions based on their judgment, especially with a second opinion. The psychiatrist's quick prescription might raise concerns about due diligence.\n\nIs the author wrong for not following the first recommendation? Not necessarily. Seeking a second opinion is prudent. The author's reluctance isn't based on denial but on wanting to explore non-drug options first. However, if the issue is significant enough that the school is involved and the principal is concerned, delaying medication might not be in the child's best interest long-term.\n\nBalancing both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for being cautious and considering alternatives. The decision to medicate is personal and should involve the parents' comfort level. They\u2019re not refusing all treatment but choosing therapy first. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
