I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves an 8-year-old with some behavioral issues at school, and there's a recommendation for ADHD medication. The parents are divided, with the husband in favor and the author resisting, preferring behavioral therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a parent who works in healthcare, so they might have some medical knowledge. They mention their son is in therapy and is making progress, albeit slowly. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author is skeptical about overdiagnosis. The husband took the son to a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked it up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I should think about the best interests of the child. ADHD is a real condition that can affect a child's life, but it's also known to be overdiagnosed. The author is cautious, which is understandable, especially since they see others get prescriptions easily. They believe in addressing the root cause through therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, medication can be effective for some children with ADHD. The school is involved, and the principal and psychologist are concerned. The author's resistance could be seen as neglecting a possible serious condition. However, they are taking steps with therapy and are not dismissing the problem, just taking a different approach.\n\nThe key points here are the child's well-being, the parents' differing opinions, and the balance between medical intervention and behavioral therapy. The author isn't ignoring the issue; they're choosing a non-medical route based on their professional experience and their child's current progress. It's a tough call because both approaches have merits. But the author isn't in the wrong just for being cautious and seeking alternatives, especially when the child is improving with therapy. The answer should be B.\n"
