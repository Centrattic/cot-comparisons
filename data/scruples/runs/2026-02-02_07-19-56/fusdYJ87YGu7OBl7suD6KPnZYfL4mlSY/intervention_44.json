I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation is about whether ADHD medication is necessary given the child's behavior.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their son is a class clown with some disruptive behavior, but grades are fine. They've been using CBT, and there's some progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and meds, but the author went to a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author is hesitant, thinking ADHD might be overdiagnosed and preferring behavioral therapy. The husband is pro-medication, leading to some conflict.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, but professionals recommend medication. However, the author is not anti-vax or anti-medication in general, just cautious. They work in healthcare, so they might have valid concerns about overprescription. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe medication isn't urgent. Also, the school's role in diagnosing vs. a psychiatrist's opinion. The author is seeking a second opinion, which is responsible. They're not ignoring the problem but are taking a different approach. \n\nOn the other hand, if the child truly has ADHD, delaying treatment might affect his school performance and social interactions. But the author believes behavioral therapy is working. It's a balance between professional advice and parental intuition. The question is whether the author is wrong for not following the psychiatrist's advice. \n\nSince there's no consensus on the diagnosis and the author is using alternative methods with some success, it's not necessarily wrong. Different approaches exist, and the parent is making an informed decision based on their experience and their child's progress. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
