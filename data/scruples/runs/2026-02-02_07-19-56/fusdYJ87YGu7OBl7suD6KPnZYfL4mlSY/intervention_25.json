I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent has a son who's been acting out in school, labeled as a class clown. They've been using cognitive behavioral therapy, and the kid is improving. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the parent got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin on the spot. The parent is hesitant, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed and prefers therapy. They work in healthcare, so they have some credibility in their concerns. The husband is pro-medication, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The parent isn't dismissing the possibility of ADHD entirely but is cautious. They have valid points about overdiagnosis and the effectiveness of therapy. On the other hand, ADHD is a medical condition that can benefit from medication, and there's a professional opinion suggesting it. However, the parent has a second opinion and is considering the child's progress with therapy.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, it's about making the best decision for the child. The parent is not refusing treatment outright but is taking time to evaluate. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe medication isn't immediately necessary. The parent's concern about overmedication is valid, and they're willing to explore non-drug solutions first. The husband's push for medication might be valid too, but the parent's approach isn't negligent.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong). The parent is making an informed decision based on their experience and the child's progress. They're not ignoring the possibility of ADHD but are cautious and seeking the best approach. It's a personal choice in a complex medical decision, and they're not harming the child by not getting a second opinion and monitoring the therapy's effectiveness.\n"
