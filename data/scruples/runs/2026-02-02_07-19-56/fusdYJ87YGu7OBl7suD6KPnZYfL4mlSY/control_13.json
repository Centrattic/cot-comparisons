I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their child on psychotropic drugs. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's 8-year-old son has been acting out in school, being disruptive, and the school psychologist suggests ADHD with medication. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot, but the author hasn't picked it up yet. They prefer behavioral therapy, which the son is already undergoing, and believe ADHD is overdiagnosed. The husband is more pro-medication. The author is in healthcare, so they might have some informed perspective there.\n\nFirst, ADHD is a medical diagnosis. If a child is showing symptoms, medication can be part of the treatment plan. But the author is concerned about overdiagnosis and overmedication. They see improvement with therapy and don't want their son relying on drugs. On the other hand, if the child actually has ADHD, not treating it might affect his academic and social development.\n\nThe school psychologist and psychiatrist's opinions are conflicting. The school psychologist suggested ADHD based on behavior, while the psychiatrist prescribed medication quickly. The author is seeking a second opinion, which is a reasonable step. The author's own experience in healthcare might make them cautious about medication. However, they also acknowledge that medication can be a valid treatment when necessary.\n\nIt's important to consider that ADHD isn't just about hyperactivity. It's about inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity affecting multiple areas of life. The author mentions that the son's grades are slightly above average, but the disruptive behavior is a concern. Behavioral therapy is effective, but sometimes combined with medication for better results.\n\nThe author's stance is that the son is a \"class clown\" and that the behavior is improving. However, they might be dismissing the possibility of ADHD because they don't want their child on drugs. There's a risk of underdiagnosis or not providing necessary treatment if ADHD is present. But there's also a valid concern about overmedicating children for typical behavior.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is denying necessary treatment based on their own biases. If the child truly has ADHD, withholding medication when it's part of a recommended treatment plan could be harmful. However, seeking a second opinion and exploring therapy is responsible. The author isn't refusing all treatment but is choosing a different approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between parental decision-making and medical advice. They are making an informed choice based on their observations and concerns. As long as they are working with healthcare providers and considering all options, they're not necessarily in the wrong. But if there's a clear medical need and they're ignoring it, that's a different scenario. The situation isn't black and white here. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're taking a cautious approach and seeking alternatives, which is reasonable. However, if the child's needs are not being met, that's a different consideration. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and without definitive evidence that the child definitely has ADHD and that medication is the only solution, the author's caution might be justified.\n"
