I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves ADHD diagnosis and the parent's decision to go with behavioral therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the author's post. The child has been disruptive in school, leading to multiple calls from the school. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. However, the parents sought a second opinion, but the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't picked up the medication yet. The author works in healthcare, is cautious about overmedication, and believes behavioral therapy is improving the child's behavior, so they're hesitant to start medication.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. ADHD is a legitimate condition, and medication is a common treatment. But the author is not dismissing the possibility entirely; they're just seeking non-drug solutions first. The child's grades are okay, and his behavior is improving with therapy. The author is concerned about overdiagnosis and long-term reliance on medication. They are pro-therapy and want to address the root cause.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if the child truly has ADHD, medication could help manage symptoms more effectively, especially if behavioral therapy alone isn't sufficient. However, the author isn't ignoring professional advice entirely\u2014they got a second opinion and are considering the psychologist's input. They are also not anti-medication but prefer caution.\n\nThe main points are the parent's informed decision-making, the child's progress in therapy, and the parent's legitimate concerns about overmedication. The answer likely depends on whether one believes in the necessity of medication for ADHD in this case. Since the author is making an informed choice based on their child's current progress and their professional experience, it's reasonable to say they are not in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
