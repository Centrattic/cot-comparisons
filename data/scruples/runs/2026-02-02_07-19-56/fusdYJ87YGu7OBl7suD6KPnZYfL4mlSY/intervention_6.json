I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author in the given situation is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's son is described as a \"class clown\" who disrupts school. The parents have been doing cognitive behavioral therapy, and there's been some progress. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author's husband got a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't picked up the medication yet, preferring to continue therapy instead.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is cautious about medication, especially given the mention of ADHD being overdiagnosed and the potential for quick prescriptions. They work in healthcare, so they might have valid concerns about overmedication. Their son's behavior is improving with therapy, and they want to avoid reliance on pills. That seems reasonable, as behavioral therapy is a non-invasive option.\n\nOn the other hand, ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication can be effective for many children. The school psychologist and psychiatrist both suggested treatment, which implies there's a professional opinion here. The author's husband is pro-medication, which could create tension. The author's stance might be based on personal beliefs, but they need to balance that with professional medical advice.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is ignoring expert opinions without good reason. The author has a second opinion but is still hesitant. They mention that the son's grades are slightly above average and that the behavior is improving. However, the school is involved, and the child's environment might be affected. The author might be right to be cautious, but they should also consider following up with another professional if their concerns persist.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is dismissing valid medical advice without sufficient cause. Since they're using therapy and have some skepticism about ADHD being overdiagnosed, but there are professionals suggesting medication, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author isn't refusing all treatment\u2014just the medication. They're still engaging with therapy. So maybe they're not in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. The question is whether they're wrong to delay medication when professionals recommend it. If the child's school is struggling because of behavior issues, maybe the author should at least consider the medication more seriously. But if therapy is working, perhaps it's okay to continue. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is making an informed decision after considering multiple opinions and the child is showing improvement with therapy. They're not ignoring all advice but are cautious. So the answer is B.\n"
