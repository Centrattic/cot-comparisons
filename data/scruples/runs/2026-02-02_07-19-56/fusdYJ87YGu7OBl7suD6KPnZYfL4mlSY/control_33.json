I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs for possible ADHD. \n\nFirst, the author has taken the child to a cognitive behavioral therapist, and there's some progress. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the author got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't filled the prescription yet and is hesitant because they believe ADHD is overdiagnosed and prefer non-medication approaches. They work in healthcare and are concerned about overprescription.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to medicate. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, ADHD can be a legitimate condition that medication helps. If the child actually has ADHD, not treating it might hinder his development. But on the other hand, the author is cautious, using therapy, and wants to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. They mention the child's behavior is improving with therapy, grades are okay, and they don't want the child to rely on pills. \n\nThe school principal sent him to the psychologist after a specific incident, but the author got a second opinion. The author's approach is to try therapy first, which is a common first-line treatment for ADHD. However, the psychiatrist's quick prescription might be a concern. The author's hesitation isn't anti-science; they work in healthcare and have valid concerns about overdiagnosis and overmedication. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children. The author is considering multiple opinions and not dismissing the possibility of ADHD but is cautious. The child's behavior is improving, so maybe medication isn't urgent. There's no evidence here that the author is ignoring professional advice entirely\u2014they sought a second opinion. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're taking a cautious, evidence-based approach, prioritizing therapy and careful consideration. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
