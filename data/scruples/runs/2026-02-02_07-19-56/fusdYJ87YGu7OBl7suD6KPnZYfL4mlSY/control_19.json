I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs for suspected ADHD. The situation involves conflicting opinions between the parents and the school's recommendation versus the parents' approach through behavioral therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical and ethical aspects. ADHD diagnosis can be complex and sometimes contentious. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the parents sought a second opinion. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the parent hasn't picked it up yet. The parent's reasoning is that their son's behavior is improving with therapy and that they're concerned about overmedication. They work in healthcare, so they might have some understanding of the system's tendencies.\n\nADHD is a recognized medical condition, and medication is a common treatment. However, behavioral therapy is also a valid approach, especially when the child is showing progress. The parent isn't denying the possibility of ADHD but is cautious due to the high rate of overdiagnosis and the desire to avoid reliance on medication. \n\nEthically, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, considering their values and the child's best interests. The key here is whether the parent's decision is harming the child. The child's grades are slightly above average, and his behavior is improving with therapy. There's no immediate evidence that medication is necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a concern that delaying medication might hinder the child's academic or social development if ADHD is indeed present. However, without a confirmed diagnosis from multiple professionals, the parent's caution might be justified. The parent is seeking to address the root causes through therapy rather than relying on medication. \n\nThe question is whether the parent is wrong for this decision. Medical guidelines often support a multimodal approach for ADHD, combining medication and therapy. But the parent hasn't ruled out medication entirely; they just want to continue with therapy first. There's no indication of neglect or harm here. The parent is informed, working in healthcare, and making a deliberate choice based on their experience and the child's current progress.\n\nSo, balancing the need for treatment with the parent's concerns about overmedication, it seems that the parent is not in the wrong. They are making a conscientious decision based on their child's current trajectory and their understanding of potential overdiagnosis.\n"
