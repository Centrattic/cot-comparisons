I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves the child's behavioral issues at school, a diagnosis of ADHD from a school psychologist, and a psychiatrist prescribing Ritalin. The author is against medication unless it's 100% necessary and prefers behavioral therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. ADHD is a common diagnosis, but it's also one that can be overdiagnosed. The child is making progress in therapy, which is a positive sign. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the author got a second opinion. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked up the prescription yet. The key points here are the author's concerns about overmedication and their preference for non-pharmacological approaches.\n\nADHD medications like Ritalin can be effective, but they come with potential side effects. The author works in healthcare, so they likely understand the medical implications. They're not anti-vax or anti-medication entirely; they just want to avoid unnecessary use. The child's grades are slightly above average, and behavior is improving with therapy. This suggests that the current approach might be working. However, school disruptions could indicate that there's more to address, possibly ADHD contributing to the behavior.\n\nThe ethical aspect here is about parental decision-making. Parents have the right to make healthcare choices for their children based on their values and the child's best interest. There's a balance between following medical advice and considering alternative methods. The author is taking a cautious approach, which is understandable given the risks of long-term medication use in children and the potential for overdiagnosis.\n\nHowever, there's also a counterpoint: if ADHD is indeed present and left untreated, it could affect the child's academic and social development. The school psychologist and psychiatrist have professional opinions, and dismissing them entirely might not be in the child's best interest. But the author is seeking a second opinion and is using therapy, which is a valid approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making an informed decision based on their child's progress and their own medical knowledge. The decision to use medication should be a careful one, and there's no black-and-white answer here. The fact that they're open to second opinions and using therapy supports their stance. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
