I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves a child who's been labeled as having possible ADHD by a school psychologist, but the parents got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin on the spot. The author is hesitant, citing that the child's behavior is improving with therapy and that ADHD might be overdiagnosed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The child is in therapy and making progress. The school thinks there's a problem, but the parent believes the child is just a typical kid. The author works in healthcare, so they might have some knowledge about medication. The husband supports medication, but the author is cautious.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. The school psychologist's assessment might be based on behavioral observations, but a proper diagnosis usually requires a comprehensive evaluation. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly, which the author is skeptical of. The author's stance is that the child's behavior is manageable with therapy and that they don't want to rely on medication.\n\nEthically, parents have the right to choose their child's treatment, especially if they believe it's in the child's best interest. However, there's also a responsibility to consider all medical advice. The author isn't dismissing all professional opinions but is seeking a second opinion and considering the child's improvement in therapy. They're not anti-medication but cautious about overuse.\n\nThe school's concern is valid, but the child's grades are okay, and the behavior is improving. The parent's hesitation might be reasonable if they feel the diagnosis is premature. The question is whether the author is wrong for waiting and not starting medication.\n\nIn terms of child welfare, there's a balance between necessary intervention and avoiding unnecessary medication. The fact that the child is progressing with therapy suggests that the current approach might be working. The author is not ignoring the problem but is taking a cautious approach. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're making an informed decision based on their child's progress and skepticism towards quick diagnoses.\n"
