I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their kid on psychotropic drugs. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's 8-year-old son is acting out in school, classified as the class clown, and the school psychologist suspects ADHD, suggesting medication. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked it up, preferring to continue with behavioral therapy since his grades are okay and he's improving slowly.\n\nThe author's reasoning: They believe ADHD is overdiagnosed, they're in healthcare, and they don't want the child reliant on pills. They think behavioral therapy is enough, especially since there's some progress already. Their husband is pro-medication, hence the conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are whether withholding medication is harmful, the child's well-being, and whether there's a valid alternative (behavioral therapy). The author is considering the child's best interests, but others might argue that if ADHD is truly present, not treating it could hinder development. However, the author mentions that the child's grades are fine and behavior is improving with therapy, which suggests it might not be severe enough for medication.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky, and overdiagnosis is a real concern. The author's stance isn't anti-med, just cautious. They're not ignoring the problem but seeking non-pharmacological solutions. On the other hand, if the child does have ADHD, delaying medication might affect his school performance and social interactions in the long run.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for this decision. It's a balance between parental intuition and medical recommendations. Since the child is showing some progress with therapy, and the author is monitoring the situation, it might be reasonable. But if the school is increasingly frustrated, maybe medication could help in the short term. However, the author isn't refusing medication outright; they're just not rushing into it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents often have to make tough choices. The author is informed, works in healthcare, and is not dismissing the possibility of ADHD entirely. They're getting a second opinion and considering alternatives. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong. They're making a considered decision based on their child's specific circumstances and their own professional insights.\n"
