I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves a child with behavioral issues at school, some evaluations suggesting ADHD, and the parents disagreeing on medication. The parent is seeking an impartial view.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The child is described as a class clown with disruptions, but grades are okay. They've been in cognitive behavioral therapy with some progress. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the parent waited, got a second opinion, and the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin. The parent hasn't picked up the prescription yet, preferring to continue therapy.\n\nThe parent's reasoning includes belief that ADHD is overdiagnosed, that behavioral therapy is working, and a general caution against medication unless 100% necessary. They work in healthcare, so they have some professional insight. The husband is pro-medication, leading to a spat.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether their stance is wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider ethics and medical standards. ADHD diagnosis can be complex, with valid concerns about overdiagnosis. However, if a professional diagnosis is made, ignoring that could be problematic. But the parent got a second opinion after the school psychologist's suggestion. The key here is that the parent is not refusing all treatment but is choosing an alternative path (therapy) that's showing some progress.\n\nEthically, the parent's concern about overmedication is reasonable. They're not anti-science but cautious. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, so the parent's approach isn't neglectful. However, there's a potential issue if the child's behavior worsens or if therapy isn't sufficient. But the parent is monitoring and open to change.\n\nThe parent's stance is within their rights to make medical decisions for their child, provided they're not denying necessary treatment. Since they're considering options and there's some improvement, their approach isn't necessarily wrong. Also, the child's grades are okay, and the behavior is improving. The parent isn't ignoring the problem but addressing it through another method.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They're making an informed choice based on their child's progress and their own professional experience. However, it's important to note that the parent should continue monitoring and follow up with professionals. The situation doesn't present a clear case of neglect or refusal of necessary care.\n"
