I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves a child with behavioral issues in school, and the school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. The parents got a second opinion, and the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin. The author is hesitant, relying on therapy and their own observations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The child's teacher reported a significant disruption, and the school psychologist thinks ADHD. The author is a healthcare worker and is skeptical of overdiagnosis. They see improvement with therapy and don't want to medicate unless absolutely necessary. The husband is more pro-medication, and there's some conflict there.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. I should think about medical ethics, parental rights, child welfare. ADHD is a real condition, but diagnosis can be tricky. The school's perspective is important too, as they see the behavior daily. The author's stance is to try therapy first, which is a valid approach. However, if the child truly has ADHD, medication can be an effective treatment alongside therapy.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's argument is that the child is improving with therapy, and they don't want to rely on drugs. The counter is that if the child has ADHD and meds could help, withholding them might be harmful. But the author is not refusing all treatment\u2014just medication. They're using therapy and considering a second opinion.\n\nAlso, the author is in healthcare, which gives them some insight, but they might not have the same expertise as a psychiatrist. The school psychologist and psychiatrist have professional opinions. However, the author's caution against overdiagnosis is valid, as ADHD can be overdiagnosed, especially in kids who are just active or have behavioral issues.\n\nThe child's grades are above average, and the behavior is improving. That suggests that maybe the child doesn't have ADHD, or maybe they have a different issue that therapy is addressing. The parent is making a decision based on observation and the child's progress. It's a balance between following professional advice and trusting their own judgment as a parent.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, including declining treatment. However, if the condition is impacting the child's education and well-being significantly, there might be a duty to consider all options. The author isn't ignoring the problem; they're actively addressing it with therapy. The key is whether the child is getting adequate support without medication.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are making an informed decision based on their child's progress and their own concerns about medication. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, if the child's condition is severe and medication is necessary, there could be an argument the other way. But given the info provided, the author's approach seems reasonable.\n"
