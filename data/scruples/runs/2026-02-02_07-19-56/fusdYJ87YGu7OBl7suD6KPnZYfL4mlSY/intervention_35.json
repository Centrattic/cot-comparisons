I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's son is 8 years old, has been acting out in school, and the school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked it up yet. The author is a healthcare worker who's skeptical of overdiagnosis and prefers behavioral therapy. The husband is pro-medication.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's reasoning. They believe medication should only be a last resort and that behavioral therapy is progressing, albeit slowly. They're worried about overmedicating and want to address the root causes. But is this inconsiderate or wrong?\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on their professional background and values, trusting therapy and not wanting to rely on drugs. On the other hand, the school and professionals are suggesting medication, which might be necessary if the child truly has ADHD. However, the author is not refusing all treatment; they're choosing an alternative path. \n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky, especially in kids. Some children might have attention issues without needing medication. The author is cautious, but they're not dismissing the problem entirely. They're working with a therapist and considering a second opinion. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the author's approach isn't necessarily harmful. \n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, both parents have different views. The author isn't neglecting their child but is making an informed choice. The school's concern is about the child's behavior affecting learning, but the grades are okay. So maybe the author is justified in their caution.\n\nI need to check if there's any clear harm in delaying medication. If the child's behavior is manageable and improving with therapy, the author's choice might be reasonable. However, if the child's condition worsens significantly, that's a different story. But based on the info given, the author isn't ignoring the issue; they're taking a measured approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like it's a tough call, but since they're making an informed decision based on their knowledge and the child's current progress, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). They're not disregarding professional advice entirely but are seeking more information and preferring non-pharmacological methods first.\n"
