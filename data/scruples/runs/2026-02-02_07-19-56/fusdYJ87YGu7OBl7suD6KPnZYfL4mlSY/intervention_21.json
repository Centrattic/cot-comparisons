I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The parent has a child with behavioral issues at school, tried cognitive behavioral therapy, and now a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin. The parent is hesitant about medication, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed and prefers non-drug approaches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The child's behavior is causing disruptions, and the school is concerned. The school psychologist and a psychiatrist have suggested ADHD and medication. The parent is a healthcare worker, which probably gives them some insight into medical practices. They believe the child's behavior is improving with therapy and don't want to rely on medication. They also mention that the child's grades are slightly above average, so maybe academic performance isn't the main issue here.\n\nThe parent is against medication unless it's 100% necessary, citing overdiagnosis. They argue that the child's behavior is typical for an 8-year-old and that behavioral therapy is working. The husband is more in favor of medication, leading to some conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the arguments for A: The school and a psychiatrist have diagnosed ADHD, so there might be a medical need. Medication is a standard treatment for ADHD, so not following the prescription could be seen as neglecting the child's health. The parent's hesitation might delay necessary treatment.\n\nArguments for B: The parent is using a second opinion approach, which is reasonable. They're considering non-medical interventions that are showing progress. The parent is in healthcare, so their concerns about overdiagnosis might be valid. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe medication isn't the only solution. Parental choice in treatment options is important, and not all parents will agree with medical recommendations.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is wrong. In many cases, parents are allowed to choose treatment paths, especially if they have valid concerns. However, if the child's behavior is significantly disruptive and affecting their education, there might be a responsibility to consider all options. But since therapy is working, maybe the parent isn't wrong in delaying medication. \n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. It's not just hyperactivity; it's about inattention and impulsivity. The parent might be right that the child's behavior is typical for a kid. Also, the parent is in healthcare, which adds credibility to their cautious approach. However, the psychiatrist's quick prescription of Ritalin might not have been the best approach if the diagnosis wasn't solid. \n\nIn the US, parents have the right to refuse medical treatment for their children unless there's a court order. So, unless the child is in immediate danger, the parent isn't in the wrong. The school's role is to support the child, and if the behavior is manageable with therapy, the parent's choice is valid. \n\nThe key here is that the parent is actively seeking alternatives and the child's behavior is improving. The school psychologist and psychiatrist might have different opinions, but the parent is making an informed decision based on their child's progress. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call. However, the parent isn't necessarily wrong for choosing non-medical routes when there's some uncertainty about the diagnosis.\n"
