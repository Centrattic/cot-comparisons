I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're at fault for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs for ADHD. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kid is in third grade and has been a class clown, causing disruptions. The school principal sent him to a psychologist who suggested ADHD and medication. The parents got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't picked up the meds yet because they're skeptical about ADHD being overdiagnosed and prefer behavioral therapy, which the child is already undergoing and showing some progress.\n\nSo, the author is a parent who's cautious about medication. They work in healthcare, so they have some medical knowledge. They think ADHD is overdiagnosed and that the kid's behavior is normal for his age with therapy helping. Their husband is pro-medication, which caused a conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here. ADHD is a medical diagnosis. If a child is diagnosed with ADHD, medication like Ritalin is a common treatment. But some parents might be hesitant, especially if they feel the diagnosis is premature or if non-pharmacological methods are working. \n\nBut the school is involved, and they might push for medication to manage the child's behavior in class. The parents have a second opinion, so they're not ignoring the issue entirely. The child's behavior is improving with CBT, which is a valid approach. However, ADHD can affect academic performance and social interactions beyond just being a class clown. The author mentions the child's grades are slightly above average, but that might not account for potential long-term issues if ADHD is untreated.\n\nThe ethical dilemma is between the parent's right to make medical decisions for their child and the child's best interest. The parent's concern about overmedication is valid, given that ADHD is sometimes overdiagnosed. However, if the child actually has ADHD, not treating it could lead to other problems. The parent's approach is to continue therapy and monitor, which is reasonable, but they might be downplaying the possibility of a legitimate condition.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical responsibility, parents are entrusted with making medical decisions for their children. However, they must consider the child's well-being. If the child's behavior is significantly impairing his ability to learn or interact, then not seeking effective treatment could be seen as neglectful. On the other hand, the parent is taking steps with therapy and seeking second opinions, which shows due diligence.\n\nI should also consider that ADHD diagnosis can be subjective. The school psychologist and psychiatrist may have different assessments. The parent's healthcare background might make them more critical of the diagnosis. However, the child's improvement with therapy doesn't necessarily rule out ADHD. Some children respond to behavioral interventions but may still benefit from medication for more severe cases.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're actively seeking solutions and considering multiple opinions. However, their skepticism might prevent the child from receiving necessary treatment if ADHD is accurately diagnosed. The answer might depend on the balance between parental choice and the child's needs.\n"
