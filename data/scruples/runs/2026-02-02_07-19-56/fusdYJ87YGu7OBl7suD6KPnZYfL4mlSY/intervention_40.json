I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves an 8-year-old with behavioral issues at school, and the school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication. The author is hesitant, prefers behavioral therapy, and hasn't picked up the prescription yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical guidelines. ADHD diagnosis typically requires a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified professional. The school psychologist's opinion is one data point, but a psychiatrist's diagnosis might be more reliable. However, the author mentions getting a second opinion, which is a good step. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, which might not be ideal; thorough assessment is usually recommended before starting medication.\n\nThe author is using cognitive behavioral therapy and sees progress. The child's grades are slightly above average, and the author thinks he's a bit more hyper but not necessarily ADHD. The author works in healthcare, so they have some understanding of the system but might have valid concerns about overdiagnosis.\n\nOn the other hand, the school is involved, and the child's behavior is causing disruptions. The author's husband is pro-medication, and there's a conflict here. The author's stance is not anti-vax but cautious about medication. They believe in addressing the root cause through therapy.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Medical decisions often involve parental judgment and professional advice. If the child is improving with therapy, maybe medication isn't urgent. But if there's a valid diagnosis, delaying treatment could have consequences. However, the author is seeking a second opinion and isn't refusing all medication, just not rushing into it. The key points are whether the diagnosis is certain and if alternatives are effective. Since the author is taking an informed approach and the child is making progress, maybe they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
