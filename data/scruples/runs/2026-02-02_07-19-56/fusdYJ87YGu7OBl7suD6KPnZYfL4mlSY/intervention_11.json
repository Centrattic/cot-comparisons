I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The situation involves the child's behavior in school, a school psychologist's recommendation for ADHD medication, and the parents' differing opinions. The author prefers behavioral therapy and is skeptical of ADHD diagnoses.\n\nFirst, the key points: The child is getting into trouble at school, a school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication. The parents get a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribes Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't picked up the prescription, thinking the ADHD diagnosis might be overdone. They believe therapy is working and don't want the child on meds unless absolutely necessary.\n\nI need to consider the ethical and medical aspects. ADHD is a legitimate condition that can benefit from medication, but it's also overdiagnosed. The author is concerned about reliance on medication and wants to focus on behavioral therapy. However, the school psychologist and psychiatrist both have professional opinions. The author's husband is pro-medication, which adds a family dynamic element.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that therapy is effective and they don't want their son on drugs. But is it wrong to deny potentially beneficial medication? On the other hand, the author is cautious and in the healthcare field, so they might have valid concerns about overmedication. However, if the child truly has ADHD, not treating it could cause long-term issues. The school is involved, and the child's behavior is problematic. The author might be right to seek alternatives, but is it in the child's best interest?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the child has ADHD. If they do, the author might be withholding treatment. If not, they're avoiding unnecessary medication. The problem is that the diagnosis is uncertain. The school psychologist and psychiatrist have different assessments. The author is waiting for a second opinion but hasn't acted on the prescription yet.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, the parents must make decisions in the child's best interest. There's no clear right or wrong here. The author isn't ignoring all advice but is taking a cautious approach. However, delaying or refusing medication when a professional recommends it could be risky if the diagnosis is correct. The author's stance might be reasonable given the uncertainty, but it's a close call. The answer isn't straightforward, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a gray area.\n"
