I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for refusing to put their 8-year-old son on ADHD medication. The parent argues that the child is improving with behavioral therapy and doesn't want to start medication unless absolutely necessary. They mention the child's school disruptions, a diagnosis from a school psychologist, and a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin on the spot. The parent is in healthcare and is cautious about overdiagnosis.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical guidelines. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication like Ritalin can be effective. But the parent has a valid point about overdiagnosis. The child's grades are okay, and behavior is improving with therapy. The school psychologist's assessment might not be sufficient on its own. It's important to note that a proper ADHD diagnosis usually requires multiple evaluations by qualified professionals over time. Relying on a single school psychologist's opinion and a psychiatrist who prescribes on the spot without thorough assessment could be problematic. The parent is seeking a second opinion, which is responsible. They're not anti-medication but cautious, which is reasonable. The child's behavior is age-appropriate in some ways, and the parent prefers addressing root causes through therapy. \n\nHowever, the school and teachers have observed significant disruptions. The parent should ensure that the child is not being denied necessary treatment if ADHD is genuine. But the current scenario shows that the diagnosis isn't fully confirmed. The parent's hesitation isn't due to anti-medical beliefs but a desire for more certainty. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent is taking steps to verify the diagnosis and prefers non-pharmacological approaches first, which is a common approach in pediatric treatment. They're not dismissing the possibility entirely but want to be sure. The husband's push for medication is valid too, but the parent isn't wrong for being cautious here. So the answer is B.\n"
