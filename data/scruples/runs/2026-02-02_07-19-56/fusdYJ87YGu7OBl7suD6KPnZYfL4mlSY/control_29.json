I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their child on psychotropic drugs. Let's start by understanding the situation as presented.\n\nThe author's 8-year-old son has been acting out in school, labeled a class clown, and disrupting classes. The school psychologist suggests ADHD and recommends medication. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked up the script yet. The author is in healthcare, thinks ADHD is overdiagnosed, and prefers behavioral therapy, which the child is already undergoing with some progress. The husband is pro-medication. The author is concerned about reliance on drugs and wants to address issues at the root.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for this stance. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the school's role. The school psychologist's assessment is based on the child's behavior, but maybe they didn't consider other factors. However, ADHD is a medical diagnosis, and the school's input might be part of the process. However, they might not be the final authority here.\n\nThe psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot. That seems quick. The author mentions that in healthcare, they see psychiatrists writing scripts quickly to calm parents. This could indicate a possible overprescription issue, which the author is wary of.\n\nThe child's behavior is improving with therapy. The author is a proponent of non-pharmacological approaches, which is a valid perspective. There's evidence that behavioral therapy can be effective for ADHD, especially in children. However, ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder; medication can help with focus and impulse control.\n\nThe author's concern about overdiagnosis is valid. Studies do show that ADHD is sometimes overdiagnosed, and medication isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. However, it's also possible that the child does have ADHD and medication could be beneficial alongside therapy.\n\nThe key here is the balance between the parents' responsibility to seek appropriate treatment and respecting the child's needs. The author is getting a second opinion, which is prudent. The school's recommendation doesn't necessarily mean medication is the only option, but it might be a necessary part for the child's academic and social environment.\n\nThe author is not refusing treatment entirely but is choosing a different approach. The husband's push for medication vs. the author's caution. The author's healthcare background might give them insight into potential overprescription, but they also need to trust in the medical professionals' advice.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical wrong, the author isn't violating any laws by not medicating. The decision is a parental choice. However, if the school is involved and there's a concern about the child's well-being or educational needs, there might be a push for intervention. But the author is exploring alternatives.\n\nThe child's well-being is the main concern. If the child is progressing in therapy, maybe medication isn't needed. But if the behavior is impacting school performance (even if grades are okay), medication might help. The author's stance is cautious, which isn't inherently wrong, but they should monitor the child's progress closely.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Not necessarily. They're making an informed decision, seeking therapy, and considering the risks of medication. However, they should continue to consult with professionals and remain open to adjusting their approach if therapy isn't sufficient. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're making a considered choice, but there's a nuance where they should ensure the child's needs are met regardless of their personal stance on medication.\n"
