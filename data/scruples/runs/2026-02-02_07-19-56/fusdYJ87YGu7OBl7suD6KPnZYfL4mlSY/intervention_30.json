I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The author is a parent who's concerned about overdiagnosis of ADHD and prefers behavioral therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The child has been disruptive in school, been to a cognitive behavioral therapist, and there's a suggestion of ADHD from a school psychologist. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the parent hasn't picked it up, citing concerns about overmedication. The parent works in healthcare, so they have some knowledge, but they're against medication unless absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the arguments for and against. On one hand, the school is involved, there are multiple disruptions, and professionals are suggesting medication. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication can help manage symptoms, especially when therapy isn't sufficient yet. The parent's hesitation might delay treatment if the child actually does have ADHD, which could affect his academic and social development.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is seeking a second opinion, which is responsible. They're not dismissing the possibility entirely but are cautious about overdiagnosis. They're using therapy, which has shown some improvement. The parent's concern about relying on medication and addressing root causes is valid, and they're making a decision based on their child's current progress.\n\nThe key here is balancing the child's needs with the parent's judgment. The parent isn't ignoring the problem; they're exploring alternatives first. However, they might be underestimating the potential benefits of medication if the diagnosis is accurate. The school's involvement and the psychiatrist's recommendation suggest that professionals see a need for intervention beyond what therapy is currently providing.\n\nBut the parent isn't refusing all treatment\u2014they're using therapy and considering the child's progress. They might be right in being cautious about medication, especially since ADHD can be overdiagnosed. The decision isn't made lightly, and they're seeking input from a community. The main issue is whether withholding medication when a professional suggests it is wrong. However, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, even if it means going against some recommendations, especially when they have valid concerns and are using other methods.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making an informed decision, using therapy, and considering their child's best interest. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent is responsibly evaluating options and not dismissing professional advice outright but is seeking a balanced approach.\n"
