I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent has a 8-year-old son who's been acting out in school, labeled as a class clown. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot, but the parent hasn't picked it up yet. They prefer behavioral therapy, which is working slowly but improving. The parent is in healthcare and thinks ADHD is overdiagnosed. They don't want their son reliant on pills. The husband is pro-medication.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Well, the key points here are the child's behavior, the diagnosis process, and the parent's decision. ADHD is a medical condition, but diagnosis can be subjective. The parent is using therapy, which has shown some progress. However, the school and a professional are suggesting medication. The parent's hesitation might be valid if they feel the diagnosis isn't thorough, but they might also be ignoring a potential valid medical need.\n\nBut the question is about whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their choice is neglecting the child's needs. However, the parent is taking a cautious approach, considering the child's grades are okay and behavior is improving. The parent in healthcare might have a valid perspective. The other option is that they should follow the psychiatrist's advice. But there's no clear consensus here. The parent isn't refusing all treatment; they're choosing an alternative method. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. Also, the answer should consider that parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, as long as they're not harmful. Since the child is improving with therapy, it's a reasonable approach. So the answer is B.\n"
