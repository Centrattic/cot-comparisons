I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong regarding their decision not to medicate their son for potential ADHD. The situation involves a child with behavior issues at school, a school psychologist's suggestion for medication, and the parents' differing opinions. The parent in question is hesitant about using psychotropic drugs and prefers behavioral therapy, which is showing some progress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The child is 8 years old, has some disruptive behaviors but is improving with therapy. The school and a psychiatrist suggested ADHD and medication, but the parent is skeptical, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed. The parent works in healthcare and is concerned about overmedication. The husband is pro-medication, but the mother is more cautious.\n\nNow, determining if the parent is in the wrong. In the US, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, and there's no legal wrong unless there's harm. Medically, ADHD diagnosis involves multiple evaluations. The school psychologist and a psychiatrist might have different assessments. The parent's approach of using behavioral therapy first is a valid option, as guidelines do recommend non-pharmacological interventions before medication. However, if the child's behavior is causing significant issues and the parent is resisting effective treatment, there could be a debate. But the parent isn't ignoring all advice; they're seeking a second opinion and using therapy. The child's grades are okay, and the behavior is improving, which supports the parent's stance. The parent's concern about overmedication is a common ethical discussion in pediatric care. Since the parent is not neglecting the child and is actively involved in therapy, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
