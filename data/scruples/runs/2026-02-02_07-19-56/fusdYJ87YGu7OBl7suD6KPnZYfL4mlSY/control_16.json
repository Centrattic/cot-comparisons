I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong regarding not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The child is described as a troublemaker in school, the class clown, with disruptions leading to calls from the school. They've been in CBT for a while, and the child is improving slowly. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the parents got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't picked up the medication yet, preferring to continue with therapy, believing ADHD is overdiagnosed and wanting to avoid drugs unless absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, professionals like the school psychologist and psychiatrist have recommended medication, which might indicate that there's a valid concern. The child's behavior is disruptive, even if grades are okay. ADHD is a medical condition, and medication can be part of a treatment plan. The parent's hesitation could be seen as ignoring professional advice, potentially hindering the child's progress or causing more issues in school.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is seeking a second opinion, which is prudent. They have a background in healthcare and are cautious about overmedication. The child is showing some improvement with therapy, so it's possible that non-pharmacological methods might be sufficient. The parent is advocating for a more conservative approach, which some might support, especially if they believe the child doesn't have ADHD.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent is disregarding professional recommendations without good reason. However, the parent is not ignoring all advice\u2014getting a second opinion is appropriate. They are using their knowledge and judgment, considering the child's progress in therapy. The school psychologist's assessment might not be the final word, and different professionals can have different opinions. The parent's concern about overdiagnosis and reliance on medication is a valid perspective held by some in the medical community.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If the parent is making an informed decision based on their child's progress and professional advice, perhaps not. However, there's a risk of not addressing a potential underlying condition if the child actually has ADHD and medication could help. But the parent isn't refusing all treatment; they're choosing an alternative approach. The answer might depend on whether following through with the psychiatrist's prescription is necessary despite the parent's doubts.\n\nIn many cases, treatment plans for ADHD include a combination of therapy and medication. The parent's approach of continuing therapy and monitoring might be acceptable, but if the child's behavior is worsening or significantly impairing his life, medication might be warranted. However, the parent hasn't dismissed the diagnosis outright; they're just being cautious. \n\nGiven that the parent is in the healthcare field and is making a considered decision, and the child is showing some improvement, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). It's a judgment call, and there's no clear right or wrong here. The parent isn't ignoring all advice but is making a choice based on their values and the child's current progress.\n"
