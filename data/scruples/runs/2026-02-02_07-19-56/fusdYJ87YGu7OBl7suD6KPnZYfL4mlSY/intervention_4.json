I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The main points from the post are that the son is disruptive in school, has been in therapy with some progress, and a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly. The parent is in healthcare and is skeptical about the ADHD diagnosis, thinking it's overdiagnosed. They prefer behavioral therapy and are against medicating unless absolutely necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and medical aspects. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication like Ritalin can be effective when appropriate. However, the author's concern about overdiagnosis is valid. Some studies do suggest that ADHD might be overdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, especially in children with behavioral issues that could be managed through other means.\n\nThe school psychologist and psychiatrist both suggested medication, but the author got a second opinion. The therapist notes progress in therapy, albeit slow. The key here is whether the author is denying necessary treatment. If the child does have ADHD, delaying medication could affect his academic and social development. However, if the diagnosis is incorrect, then medication might be unnecessary.\n\nThe parent's stance is not anti-medication but cautious. They're not refusing all treatment but prefer non-pharmacological approaches first. This is a common approach in managing ADHD, where behavioral therapy is often recommended before medication, especially for mild cases. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, suggests that for children aged 6-11, a combination of behavioral therapy and medication is optimal, but if behavioral therapy is effective, it can be continued without medication.\n\nThe author's husband is pro-medication, which adds to the family conflict. The parent's decision to not start medication yet might be seen as reasonable if they're waiting for more evidence or if the therapy is showing some progress. However, the school's frustration indicates that the behavior is significant enough that the school is pushing for intervention.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the accuracy of the diagnosis. If the child genuinely has ADHD and medication would help, then not pursuing it could be seen as neglecting a necessary treatment. But if the diagnosis is uncertain and the child is responding to therapy, the parent is acting in the child's best interest by avoiding unnecessary medication.\n\nThe answer isn't black and white. The parent is making an informed decision based on their experience and concerns, but they might also be resisting a legitimate medical recommendation. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and both approaches have valid points, but the parent's caution isn't necessarily wrong if the child is improving with therapy, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the therapy isn't sufficient and the child's needs are not being met, then it's a different case. Given the information provided, the author's position seems reasonable and cautious, so the answer is B.\n"
