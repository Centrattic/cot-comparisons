I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author's son has been disruptive in school, labeled a class clown, and has had some behavioral issues. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication, but the author is hesitant. They've opted for cognitive behavioral therapy instead, which is working slowly. The author works in healthcare and is concerned about overdiagnosis and overmedication, especially since the son's grades are slightly above average and other kids are doing well without meds.\n\nNow, considering the options. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not wrong (B). The key points here are the child's behavior, the effectiveness of the current therapy, and the author's stance on medication. \n\nADHD is a medical condition that requires professional diagnosis. However, the author has sought a second opinion and is considering behavioral therapy first. The school psychologist and psychiatrist have suggested medication, but the author is cautious. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, which is a positive sign. \n\nIn many cases, especially with children, behavioral interventions are the first line of treatment unless symptoms are severe. The author isn't denying all medical advice but is taking a cautious approach, which is reasonable. Their concern about overmedication is valid, given that ADHD can be overdiagnosed. The fact that other children are managing without meds supports the idea that not all cases require medication.\n\nHowever, the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot, which might be a point of concern. The author hasn't picked up the prescription yet, indicating they're still considering options. The husband is pro-medication, but the author is taking a more measured approach. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the child is improving with therapy, and they don't want the child reliant on pills. They prefer addressing the root causes. This approach is not uncommon, and many professionals agree that behavioral therapy should be tried first. \n\nOn the flip side, if the child does have ADHD, delaying medication might affect his academic performance and social interactions. However, the school hasn't mentioned severe academic decline, just disruptions. The author is not ignoring the problem but is exploring alternatives.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making an informed decision based on their child's current progress and their professional experience. It's a personal choice in a complex situation where there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
