I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their son on psychotropic drugs. The parent is hesitant about medication, thinking ADHD is overdiagnosed and prefers behavioral therapy, which the child is showing some progress in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The school and a school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, which the parent hasn't filled yet. The parent is in healthcare, so they have some medical knowledge, but they're also cautious about overprescribing. The husband is pro-medication, leading to some conflict.\n\nADHD is a real condition, and medications like Ritalin can be effective. But overdiagnosis is a valid concern. The child's behavior is disruptive, but grades are okay, and therapy is helping. The parent is not anti-medication but wants to avoid unnecessary use. \n\nIs the parent wrong for not using medication? Well, the decision is between them and their child's healthcare provider. The parent has a legitimate concern about overmedication and the child is improving with therapy. However, they might be ignoring a possible legitimate diagnosis. But the parent has the right to make informed decisions about their child's treatment, especially with their background in healthcare. The school's input is a factor, but the parent sought a second opinion. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because they're making an informed choice based on their child's progress in therapy and their own professional judgment. The situation isn't black and white, and parents have the right to choose non-pharmaceutical options first, especially when there's improvement. It's important to consider the child's well-being, and the parent is actively addressing the issue through therapy. They're not dismissing the problem but are cautious. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
