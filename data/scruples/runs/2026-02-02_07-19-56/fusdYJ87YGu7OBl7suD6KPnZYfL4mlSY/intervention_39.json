I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old on psychotropic drugs. The situation is that the kid's school thinks he might have ADHD because of classroom disruptions, and a school psychologist suggested medication. The author is reluctant, prefers behavioral therapy, and hasn't picked up the prescription yet. The husband is more pro-medication. The author works in healthcare and believes ADHD is overdiagnosed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the school is concerned about his behavior, and a professional has suggested medication. On the other, the author is cautious, using therapy and waiting to see if that works. The child's grades are okay, and he's improving with therapy. The author is not opposed to medication entirely but wants to avoid it unless 100% necessary. \n\nPossible points to consider: ADHD diagnosis can be tricky. The school psychologist's assessment might be one opinion. Getting a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin quickly could be another data point. But the author is holding off, which might be seen as not trusting the medical professionals. However, the author has a valid concern about overmedication and wants to explore other options first. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Medical decisions are personal and depend on the family's values. The author is taking a cautious approach, which some might view as responsible. Others might think they're delaying necessary treatment. Since ADHD can have long-term impacts if untreated, but the child is showing some improvement without meds, it's a balance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author is wrong for not following the psychiatrist's advice. If B, then they're right to be cautious. Since the situation is complex and there's no clear consensus on ADHD treatment, the answer likely leans towards B, not in the wrong. Different parents have different approaches, and the author is using therapy and considering all factors before medicating. The key is that the child's behavior is improving, so it's a judgment call. The author isn't ignoring the problem but is being cautious. So, B.\n"
