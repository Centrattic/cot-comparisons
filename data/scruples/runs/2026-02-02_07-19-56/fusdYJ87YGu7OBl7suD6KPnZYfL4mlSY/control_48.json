I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs for ADHD. First, I need to understand the situation. The child has been disruptive in school, but his grades are okay. They've been doing cognitive behavioral therapy, which is helping. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the author is hesitant, while the husband wants a second opinion and then the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately. The author hasn't picked up the medication yet and is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the options: AITA (Am I the Asshole) questions usually require looking at both sides. The author is concerned about overmedicating and prefers behavioral therapy. On the other hand, the school and professionals are pushing for medication. The key points are the child's current progress without meds, the author's valid concerns about overdiagnosis, and the fact that the husband got a second opinion. The author is in the healthcare field, so their perspective is informed. However, the child's behavior is disruptive, and medication might be a solution others think is necessary. \n\nIn many cases, ADHD management can involve a combination of therapy and medication. The fact that the child is improving with therapy suggests it's working, but the school might need the child to be more focused. The author's stance isn't against medication entirely but is cautious. The husband is pro-medication, so there's a conflict. The author isn't ignoring the problem but is seeking non-pharmaceutical solutions. \n\nConsidering ethics and child welfare, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The author isn't neglecting the child; they're exploring alternatives. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're making an informed choice based on their child's current progress and their own professional background.\n"
