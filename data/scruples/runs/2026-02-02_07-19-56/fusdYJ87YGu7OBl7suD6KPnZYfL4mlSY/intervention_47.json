I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs.\n\nFirst, the situation: The child is described as a class clown with some disruptive behavior at school. The school psychologist suggests ADHD and medication, but the parents seek a second opinion. The psychiatrist prescribes Ritalin immediately, but the mother hasn't picked up the prescription. She works in healthcare and is cautious about medication, preferring therapy. She believes ADHD is overdiagnosed and that behavioral therapy is working, albeit slowly.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the mother is wrong for refusing medication based on her own judgment despite professional recommendations.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, professionals are suggesting medication, which could help the child's behavior and school performance. The mother is in a healthcare field, so she might have valid concerns about overmedication. But on the other hand, if the child actually has ADHD, not treating it could lead to long-term issues.\n\nBut the mother is not ignoring the issue; she's using therapy and seeing some improvement. She's also seeking a second opinion. Maybe she's right to be cautious. However, the school is involved, and the principal and teacher are concerned. There's a balance between medical advice and a parent's intuition. The mother's stance is that the behavior is a phase and therapy is sufficient.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the mother is justified in her approach. The answer depends on whether the medication is necessary. Without more info, it's hard to say. But in the context of an AITA, the community often values parental judgment over strict adherence to professional advice if the parent is taking other steps. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
