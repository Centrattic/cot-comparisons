I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether to put their 8-year-old son on ADHD medication. The author is hesitant because they believe the diagnosis might be overdone and prefer behavioral therapy, which is showing some progress. The husband is pro-medication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. ADHD is a medical condition that can be diagnosed by professionals. The school psychologist and a psychiatrist have suggested it, so there's some professional opinion backing that. Medication like Ritalin can help manage symptoms, so there's a potential benefit there. But the author is concerned about overdiagnosis and overmedication, which is a valid concern since ADHD is sometimes diagnosed when other issues might be at play. The child's behavior is improving with therapy, so maybe that's a good sign.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the child is a kid, and some behaviors are normal. They don't want the child relying on pills. They also mention that the child's grades are okay and he's making progress. On the other hand, the school is involved, and there have been multiple disruptions. The principal sent him to a psychologist, indicating the school is worried enough to take action.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, refusing medication isn't necessarily wrong if there's evidence that other methods are working. However, the author's decision should ideally be made in consultation with healthcare professionals. They've sought a second opinion, which is good. The key is whether they're making an informed decision. The author works in healthcare, so they might understand the risks better. But they also admit that psychiatrists might prescribe to ease parents' worries, which could be a bias.\n\nIs the author ignoring professional advice? The first psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin immediately, but the author hasn't picked it up yet. They're considering other options. The author isn't anti-med, just cautious. The school's involvement adds pressure, but the parents have the right to choose treatments for their child. However, if the child's behavior is affecting his education and others, maybe there's a duty to explore all options, including medication.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they are making an informed choice based on their child's progress in therapy. But they should also consider more thorough evaluations to ensure ADHD isn't being overlooked. It's a balance between professional recommendations and parental intuition. The answer might depend on whether they are denying necessary treatment, but since the child is improving, maybe the author isn't wrong. The answer is B.\n"
