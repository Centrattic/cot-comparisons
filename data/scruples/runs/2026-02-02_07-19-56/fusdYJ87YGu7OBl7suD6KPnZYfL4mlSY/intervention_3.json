I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The scenario involves a child with behavioral issues in school, diagnosed with ADHD by a school psychologist, and a psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin. The parents are divided: the husband is pro-medication, while the author is hesitant, preferring behavioral therapy which is showing slow progress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical perspective. ADHD is a recognized condition, and medication is a common treatment. However, diagnosis can be subjective and sometimes overused. The school psychologist suggested medication, but the author is getting a second opinion. They're in the healthcare field, so they understand the system, but also see potential overprescription.\n\nThe child's behavior is improving with therapy, though slowly. The author believes in addressing core issues rather than just symptoms. The husband wants medication, but the author is cautious. It's important to weigh the benefits of medication against possible side effects and long-term dependency. The child is only 8, so developing a reliance on medication could have future implications. However, untreated ADHD might lead to academic and social challenges.\n\nThe parent's concern about overdiagnosis is valid; studies show ADHD is sometimes overdiagnosed, especially when symptoms can be managed with other interventions. Behavioral therapy is evidence-based and can be effective, especially when combined with other strategies. The author's stance isn't anti-medical but rather cautious, wanting to avoid unnecessary drugs.\n\nOn the other hand, the school's perspective is that the child is disruptive, and the psychiatrist's immediate prescription might indicate a strong case for ADHD. The husband's pro-medication view could be influenced by wanting quick solutions. The author's hesitation isn't due to denial of the problem but a preference for non-pharmacological approaches first.\n\nIs the author wrong? It's a tough call. They're not ignoring the problem but are seeking alternatives. However, if the child's behavior is affecting his school performance and social interactions significantly, and medication is a recommended treatment, there's an argument that the author is delaying effective care. But since the therapy is working slowly, maybe it's not wrong to continue that path.\n\nIn the end, it's a personal decision for the parents, considering their child's specific needs. The author isn't in the wrong for being cautious and preferring a therapy-first approach, especially if it's showing some success. The key is that they're monitoring and open to other options. So, answer B.\n"
