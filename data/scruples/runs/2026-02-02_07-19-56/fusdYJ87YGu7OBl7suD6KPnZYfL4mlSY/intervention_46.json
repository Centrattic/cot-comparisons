I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. The author is a parent who's been working with a therapist and sees some progress, but the school psychologist suggested ADHD medication. The husband got a prescription, but the author hasn't picked it up yet. They work in healthcare, are skeptical about ADHD being overdiagnosed, and prefer behavioral therapy.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the parent is cautious and wants to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. They mention their son's behavior is improving without it, so maybe they're right to be cautious. On the other hand, the school and a psychiatrist have recommended medication, which might indicate a valid concern for ADHD. The parent's skepticism about overdiagnosis is valid, but so is the concern about medicating a child for normal behavior.\n\nI should think about the evidence. The son is 8, and hyperactivity is common in kids. The grades are above average, which might suggest that ADHD isn't severely impacting his academic performance. The therapist is making progress, albeit slowly. The parent is in healthcare, which gives them some credibility in their skepticism, but they also admit that the psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin quickly. \n\nBut is the author wrong for not wanting to use medication? Well, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, and there's no legal wrong here. The ethical side is more about whether withholding medication is the best choice. The author is choosing an alternative approach that's showing some results. However, if the child does have a legitimate need for medication that's being ignored, that could be harmful. But the author isn't denying all treatment; they're using therapy. So maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they're making an informed choice based on their observations and the child is improving with therapy.\n"
