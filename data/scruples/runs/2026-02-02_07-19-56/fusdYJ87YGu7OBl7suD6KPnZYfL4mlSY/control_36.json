I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted this on Reddit is in the wrong for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The child has been acting out at school, classified as a class clown, and there's a history of school disruptions. The school psychologist suggested ADHD and medication. The parents got a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin on the spot. The mother hasn't picked up the prescription yet, and she's the one questioning whether she's at fault. She works in healthcare, is cautious about overdiagnosis, and prefers behavioral therapy. Her other kids are fine, and the son's grades are okay, with gradual improvement in therapy.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, ADHD is a medical condition, and if the child has it, medication can help manage symptoms, especially if behavioral therapy isn't sufficient yet. The psychiatrist's quick prescription might be a red flag, but that's a different issue. The mother's hesitation is valid given the overdiagnosis concerns, but she's also the parent making the decision based on her child's progress in therapy. \n\nOn the other hand, the school and professionals are concerned, and the father is pro-medication. The mother is taking a cautious approach, which is reasonable. She's not dismissing the problem but is seeking alternatives. Her child is improving with therapy, so maybe medication isn't immediately necessary. However, there's a balance between being cautious and potentially denying needed treatment. \n\nADHD diagnosis can be subjective. The child's behavior is considered normal by her standards but problematic at school. The key is whether the child's actions are significantly impairing his functioning. If grades are okay and therapy is working, maybe medication isn't urgent. Also, the psychiatrist's quick decision might not be thorough enough, which the mother is considering by not acting yet.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, parents have the right to make decisions for their children, including medical ones. The mother is not refusing all treatment but is opting for a non-pharmacological approach first. Her reasoning is based on her profession and observations. Unless the child's behavior is causing severe issues that therapy can't address, her stance might be valid. \n\nHowever, there's a risk in delaying medication if the diagnosis is correct. But since she's getting a second opinion and the child is improving, it's a middle path. The school's role is to support the child, but they might push for medication if they think it's necessary for classroom management. The mother's priority is the child's long-term reliance on pills versus addressing core issues. \n\nI think the mother is acting within her rights as a parent to weigh different treatment options. The question is whether she's wrong for not proceeding with medication. Since the child is making progress in therapy and the diagnosis isn't conclusive, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
