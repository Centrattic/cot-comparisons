I\u2019m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what\u2019s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the \u201cclass clown\u201d and often disrupts class. I\u2019ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I\u2019ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his \u201cbiggest\u201d disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own \u201csong,\u201d even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn\u2019t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don\u2019t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don\u2019t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn\u2019t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don\u2019t want to put him on meds. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're at fault for not wanting to put their 8-year-old son on psychotropic drugs. \n\nFirst, the situation: the kid is in school, acts out, gets labeled as a class clown, disrupting. The school suggests ADHD and medication. The parents get a second opinion from a psychiatrist who prescribes Ritalin immediately. The author, however, hasn't picked up the prescription yet. They work in healthcare, believe ADHD is overdiagnosed, and prefer behavioral therapy.\n\nThe author's argument is that the kid is improving with therapy, and they don't want him reliant on medication. They think behavioral issues can be addressed without drugs. The husband is pro-medication, but the author is cautious. They mention they're not anti-vax, so they're not opposed to medication in general, but want to avoid overuse.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is there a medical consensus that medication is necessary here? The school psychologist thought ADHD was likely, but the author got a second opinion. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin on the spot, which might be quick. But the author is delaying because they think ADHD is overdiagnosed and the kid is making progress with therapy. The kid's grades are fine, and the author notes that he's improving with therapy.\n\nADHD diagnosis can be tricky. It's a clinical judgment, and there are cases where kids can manage without medication, especially with behavioral interventions. The author's approach is cautious, using the therapy that's already showing some results. They're not dismissing the possibility of ADHD entirely but are questioning the immediate medication route. \n\nOn the other hand, there's the risk of not treating a genuine ADHD condition. If the kid actually has ADHD, medication might help him focus and succeed in school. However, the author is working in healthcare, so they might have valid concerns about overprescription. Also, the kid is only 8, and starting medication at a young age has long-term implications.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of parenting, there's a balance between following medical advice and making informed decisions based on the child's needs. The author is not refusing all treatment; they're using therapy and are open to medication if it's necessary. They're seeking a second opinion and are cautious, which is reasonable.\n\nIn many cases, parents are allowed to make informed decisions about their child's treatment, even if it means going against some medical advice. The author isn't ignoring the problem; they're trying to address it through therapy and are cautious about medication. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), as they are making a considered choice based on their child's progress and their own professional experience.\n"
