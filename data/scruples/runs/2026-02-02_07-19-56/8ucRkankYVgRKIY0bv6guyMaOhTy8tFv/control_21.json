Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who suggested using Google Translate was in the wrong. The scenario is a group project with a foreign exchange student from South Korea. The user tried to use translation to communicate more effectively, but the other group members (the girls) called them insensitive for excluding the student from their culture.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to improve efficiency. Using a translation tool seems practical, especially when time is limited (they had only one class period). The exchange student's English wasn't good, so using Google Translate would help bridge the communication gap. The student nodded in agreement, so it wasn't forced.\n\nBut the girls felt it was exclusionary. They might have thought that using the tool made the student feel like they weren't being included culturally, perhaps expecting the group to try speaking in English or the student's language instead. However, the student might not be comfortable speaking in their native language if others don't understand, or maybe they prefer to learn English. Also, using a translator could be respectful, acknowledging the language barrier and trying to include the student despite it.\n\nThe key points are the intent to be efficient and the student's agreement. The girls' reaction might stem from a different perspective on inclusion. However, the user didn't do anything that directly harmed the student. The student was involved in the decision since they nodded. So, the user's action was likely well-meaning. The girls might have felt it was excluding, but the user's approach was practical and the student consented. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
