Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who suggested using Google Translate is wrong. The scenario involves a group project in a biology lab with a Korean exchange student. The main issue is that the person used a translation app, and the other group members called them insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author's goal was to communicate more efficiently with the student who had limited English. Using a translation tool seems practical here, especially under time constraints. However, the other group members felt that this approach was exclusionary or culturally insensitive.\n\nNow, thinking about cultural sensitivity. In some cultures, relying on technology for communication might be seen as a barrier to learning the language or building rapport. The Korean student might have preferred to practice their English even if it was slow, which could be part of their exchange experience. By using the app, the author might have inadvertently signaled that the student's English wasn't sufficient for effective communication, which could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't see it as excluding the student and just wanted to get the project done efficiently. The student smiled and nodded, which might indicate agreement, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were comfortable or preferred that method. The other group members' reactions suggest that they felt the approach was disrespectful, which complicates things.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could have first tried to communicate in English, then used the app if needed. But given the time pressure, the author's action was likely to ensure the task was completed. However, the key point is the perception of the other group members. If they felt the approach was dismissive, then the author might have overlooked the cultural aspect, making them at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, considering both efficiency and cultural sensitivity, the author's action was not inherently wrong but could have been insensitively implemented. The answer might hinge on whether the author considered the student's feelings and the cultural context. Since the other group members felt excluded, the author might be in the wrong due to not anticipating their perspective.\n"
