Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who used Google Translate in their group project was wrong. The person is in a lab group with a South Korean exchange student who has limited English. They suggested using Google Translate to communicate more efficiently. The other two girls in the group called them insensitive and accused them of excluding the student.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The person wanted to be efficient and help the group work better. They even checked with the student first and got a nod. So they weren't being rude on purpose. But the girls felt that using the translator was excluding the student from their culture. That's a valid concern because language is part of cultural integration. However, the student's primary issue is the language barrier, not wanting to integrate. The student probably wants to understand and participate, not necessarily be excluded. Using a translator can actually help them participate more effectively.\n\nOn the other hand, the girls might be worried that relying on translation could hinder the student's ability to practice English or feel undervalued. But the student's English isn't good, so using a translator makes sense for clarity. The person in question didn't force it; they asked and got approval. So the student was in agreement.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe using the translator sparingly or encouraging both parties to try speaking a bit, but the main point is that the person's action was to facilitate communication, not exclude. The girls' reaction might stem from cultural sensitivity concerns, but the person didn't act with malice. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong.\n"
