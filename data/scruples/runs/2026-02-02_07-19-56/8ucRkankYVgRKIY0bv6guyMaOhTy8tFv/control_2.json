Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who suggested using Google Translate was in the wrong. The situation is a group project in a biology lab with a foreign exchange student from South Korea. The key points here are the use of translation tools to facilitate communication and the reaction of the other group members.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to increase efficiency. The exchange student's English wasn't good, so using Google Translate seemed like a practical solution. The student agreed by smiling and nodding, which indicates consent. So from the author's perspective, it was a helpful gesture.\n\nHowever, the other girls criticized the author for being insensitive and excluding the student from their culture. The issue here might be the perception that using a translation app was dehumanizing or not respectful. Language is a big part of cultural identity, and relying on a tool might be seen as not making an effort to communicate in the student's language or as reducing the interaction to just functional communication without cultural engagement.\n\nBut on the other hand, the student agreed to the use of the app. If it's a matter of mutual consent, then the author isn't wrong. The criticism from the girls might stem from their own biases or assumptions about what's respectful. It's possible they felt the app was unnecessary or that the student should be integrated more through language learning, but the student's nod suggests it was acceptable to him.\n\nCultural sensitivity is important, but so is practicality in a time-constrained academic setting. The author was trying to ensure the group could complete their task efficiently, which is a valid concern. Unless the student had previously expressed discomfort with using translation tools, the author's action doesn't seem malicious. The other group members' reaction might be overstepping if they judge the student's preferences without consulting him directly.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was well-intentioned and consensual. The criticism from the girls seems unfounded unless there's more context about the student's feelings towards using translation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
