Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting using Google Translate to communicate with a Korean exchange student during a lab project. The group had a time constraint, and the student's English wasn't good. The user thought using the tool would help efficiency. The exchange student agreed, but the other two girls called the user insensitive and said they were excluding the student.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to make communication easier. They didn't mean to exclude the student; they wanted to work efficiently. The student nodded in agreement, so it seems they were okay with the suggestion. The problem came from the other girls' reactions, who felt that using the tool was excluding the student from their culture. \n\nBut is using a translation app actually exclusionary? It's a tool to bridge language gaps. The user didn't mock or ignore the student; they tried to adapt. The other girls might be being overly sensitive, or maybe they misunderstood the intent. The key points are that the user acted with good intentions, the student agreed, and the real issue is the other group members' reactions. So the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
