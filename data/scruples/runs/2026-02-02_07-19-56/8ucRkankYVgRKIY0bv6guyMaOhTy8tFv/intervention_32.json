Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who suggested using Google Translate was in the wrong. The situation is a group project in a bio lab with an exchange student from South Korea. The author used Google Translate to communicate because the student's English wasn't good, aiming for efficiency. The other girls accused them of being insensitive and excluding the student.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural aspect. The exchange student might value face-to-face communication and could feel that using translation tools makes them seem incapable or not respected. In many cultures, there's a preference for direct interaction, even if it's challenging. Using a tool might be seen as a barrier to building rapport or understanding cultural nuances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to make the project more efficient. Time was limited, and using a reliable tool could help ensure tasks are completed. The student agreed to it, so maybe they didn't mind. But maybe the girls felt that the approach was dismissive of the student's efforts to communicate in English.\n\nI should also think about alternative approaches. Maybe the author could have offered to communicate via both methods, using translation when necessary but also encouraging direct conversation where possible. That way, they support the student without making them feel isolated.\n\nThe key points here are intention vs. perception. The author's intent was practical, but the outcome was perceived as exclusion. Cultural sensitivity is important, and even well-meaning actions can have unintended consequences. So, while the author might not have ill intent, the action could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the cultural implications and the feelings of the other group members.\n"
