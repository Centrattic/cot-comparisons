Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the person who suggested using Google Translate is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is a group project in a bio lab with a Korean exchange student who has limited English. The author used Google Translate to communicate more efficiently. The other girls in the group called him an insensitive asshole for excluding the student culturally.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to improve efficiency. Using a translation tool makes sense when there's a language barrier. The student nodded in agreement, so he wasn't opposed. The main issue seems to be that the girls felt it was culturally insensitive. But does using a tool like Google Translate actually exclude someone culturally? Or is it a practical solution? \n\nCultural sensitivity is important, but if the student himself agrees to using the tool, maybe the girls are overreacting. The author didn't make the student feel excluded; the student was part of the group. The real problem might be the girls' perspective, not the author's action. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girls felt that using the tool prevented the student from practicing English or integrating more. But the student had limited English, so using a translator would be more effective. The author's approach was practical. \n\nSo, considering the student agreed and the goal was to complete the project efficiently, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
