Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who used Google Translate is wrong for suggesting it to communicate with a Korean exchange student. The situation is a group project in a bio lab. The person pulled out their phone to use Google Translate after realizing the student's English was limited. The exchange student smiled and nodded, but the other two girls called them insensitive and said they were excluding the student.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points here are intent and the impact. The author's intention was to make the group more efficient by using a tool that both they and the exchange student could use. The exchange student agreed, so there was consent. Using translation tools is a common way to bridge language gaps, and it's practical. However, the other girls felt it was insensitive and exclusionary. \n\nBut why would they think that? Maybe they felt it was dehumanizing or that it made the exchange student feel like they couldn't communicate properly. However, the exchange student didn't seem to mind since they smiled and nodded. If the student agreed, then the author's action was respectful. The other girls' reaction might stem from a misunderstanding. \n\nCultural sensitivity is important. Maybe the other girls thought that using a translation app was not showing enough effort to communicate in the student's language or that they should be treated like everyone else. But the author didn't have the student's language, so using a tool is a reasonable solution. The main point is that the exchange student was okay with it, so the author isn't wrong. The other group members' opinions might be subjective, but the author's intent was to help, not to exclude.\n"
