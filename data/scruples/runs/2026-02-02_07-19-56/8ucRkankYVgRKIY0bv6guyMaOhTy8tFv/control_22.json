Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who suggested using Google Translate is in the wrong. The situation is that they have a group project with a Korean exchange student whose English isn't great. The person used Google Translate to help communicate, but the other girls in the group accused them of being insensitive and excluding the student from their culture.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main points are: the student's English is poor, the person tried to use a tool to facilitate communication for efficiency, the exchange student agreed, but others felt it was rude.\n\nIs using translation tools inherently wrong? Well, if the student agreed, then it seems like it's a practical solution. The person's intention was to make the group work more efficient, which is understandable. However, maybe the other group members felt that using the tool was a way to avoid learning English or that it wasn't respectful. But the exchange student nodded in agreement, so it wasn't forced. \n\nCultural sensitivity could be a factor. Perhaps the other girls thought that using the student's native language through translation might not be the best approach, maybe preferring to use basic English or another method that involves more direct interaction. However, the student's consent is important here. The person didn't force it; the student was okay with it.\n\nThe other group members' reaction might be based on a misunderstanding. Maybe they thought the suggestion was to exclude the student's input, but since the student nodded, that's not the case. The person's action was to include, not exclude. The term \"excluding him from our culture\" is a bit vague. If the culture refers to the English-speaking group's way of working, maybe they wanted to practice English, but the student's agreement suggests that was acceptable to him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on intent and respect. The author didn't act out of malice; they aimed to help. The student agreed. Therefore, the author isn't wrong. The other group members might have their own opinions, but the author's action was appropriate given the circumstances.\n"
