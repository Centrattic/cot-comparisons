Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The scenario is a group project in a Bio lab with a South Korean exchange student. The person used Google Translate to communicate because the student's English wasn't good. The other girls called them insensitive and excluded the student.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the person's intention was to make communication easier and efficient. Using a translation app seems practical. But the girls felt it excluded the student. Maybe they thought it was better to practice English or engage in cultural exchange. But the student nodded in agreement, so he might have been okay with it. Maybe the girls were overreacting. The person wasn't being rude, just trying to help. So probably the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
