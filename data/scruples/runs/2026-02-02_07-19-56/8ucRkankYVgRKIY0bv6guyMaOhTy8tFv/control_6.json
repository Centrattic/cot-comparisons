Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is a General Bio lab where the group has a South Korean exchange student with limited English. The author suggests using Google Translate to make communication easier during a project. The exchange student agrees, but the two girls in the group call the author insensitive for excluding the student from their culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's goal was efficiency, which is understandable in a group project with time constraints. They didn't force the student to use it; the student nodded in agreement. That seems respectful. \n\nBut then, why do the girls think it's excluding? Maybe they feel that using a tool like Google Translate is a crutch and that the student should be integrating into the group by speaking English. The other guy's English isn't good, so maybe he's not confident, and using a translator makes him feel isolated. However, the author's approach might have been the most practical given the time. \n\nCultural sensitivity is important. The girls might believe that using the student's native language through a translator is making him rely on it instead of engaging in the classroom's culture. But the student was the one who agreed to it. So the author is trying to accommodate the student's needs to ensure the project gets done. \n\nI think this is a classic case of different perspectives. The author was focused on the task and ensuring the student could participate effectively. The girls might be more focused on the social aspect and the student's language learning. The key here is that the student consented to using the translator. So the author isn't wrong in suggesting it. The girls' reaction is based on their own values, but the author's action was practical and considerate of the student's comfort. \n\nAlso, the students are in a lab setting where the primary goal is completing the project. If the student's English isn't sufficient, using a translator is a reasonable solution. The author didn't exclude the student; they actually tried to include him by making communication easier. \n\nSo the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. Their intention was to help the group work better under time constraints, and the student agreed. The girls' criticism might be valid in another context, but here, the author acted appropriately.\n"
