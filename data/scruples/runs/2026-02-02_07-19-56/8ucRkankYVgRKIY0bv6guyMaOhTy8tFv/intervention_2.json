Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is part of a group project in a bio lab with a South Korean exchange student. The group includes two girls. The assignment is to build amino acid models, and they have limited time. The user notices that the exchange student's English isn't great, so they suggest using Google Translate to communicate more efficiently. The student agrees, but the other girls call the user insensitive and accuse them of excluding the student from their culture.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault (AITA). The person thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I should consider the intent. The user's intention was to improve efficiency by using a tool that helps communication. That's understandable, especially under time pressure. The exchange student smiled and nodded, so he didn't seem offended. The issue comes from the other girls feeling that using translation excludes the student culturally.\n\nBut does using translation exclude someone culturally? Well, the student might still feel included if they can communicate effectively. However, maybe the girls felt that using translation wasn't respectful to the student's effort to learn English or engage in the language. Alternatively, maybe they thought it's better for the student to practice English to integrate more, but the user's approach might have been seen as a quick fix that undermines the student's agency.\n\nAnother angle: the student's nod might mean he was okay with using the tool, but maybe the girls thought the student was just agreeing out of politeness. In some cultures, saying no can be rude, so maybe the student didn't want to refuse. The user might not have considered the social dynamics here.\n\nAlso, the user acted without checking if the student was comfortable with it. Even though the student nodded, perhaps the user should have discussed it more with the group first. Maybe the girls felt the user was making a unilateral decision that affected the group's dynamics. The user's action might have been seen as prioritizing efficiency over the student's feelings or the group's cohesion.\n\nBut then again, the student's agreement suggests he was okay with it. The girls' reaction could be based on their own cultural biases or misunderstandings. Maybe they thought the student would appreciate practicing English, but he actually preferred using the tool to focus on the task.\n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The user's intention was good, but the execution might have overlooked the group's dynamics. Using translation isn't inherently wrong, but the way it was introduced and the group's reaction complicates it. The user might not have considered alternative approaches, like asking the student if he wanted to use the tool or if he preferred practicing English. Alternatively, maybe the user should have discussed the idea with the entire group first to get consensus.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The user's action might not be the author's fault if the student agreed and the task was time-sensitive. However, the girls' perspective might stem from a place of wanting to support the student's integration. The user could have been more considerate of the group's feelings and the student's possible preferences beyond just getting the task done.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the user not being in the wrong (B), but there's a valid argument on the other side about group dynamics and cultural sensitivity.\n"
