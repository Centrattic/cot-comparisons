Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who suggested using Google Translate is in the wrong. The situation is in a lab group with a Korean exchange student who has limited English. The person used Google Translate to facilitate communication, but the other girls called them an insensitive asshole for excluding the student.\n\nHmm. First, the student's intention was to make the group more efficient. They checked with the exchange student, who agreed. So the student wasn't being rude directly. The problem is that the other girls felt this was excluding the exchange student from their culture. But is that a valid point?\n\nUsing translation tools can actually help communication when language barriers exist. The student made sure the exchange student was okay with it. The criticism from the others seems to stem from a misunderstanding. They might think that using the tool makes the exchange student feel isolated, but in reality, it could help him participate better. The key here is whether using the tool was respectful. Since the exchange student nodded and agreed, it shows he was comfortable. So maybe the other girls are being overly sensitive or not understanding the actual situation. The student acted to include everyone by improving communication, not to exclude. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
