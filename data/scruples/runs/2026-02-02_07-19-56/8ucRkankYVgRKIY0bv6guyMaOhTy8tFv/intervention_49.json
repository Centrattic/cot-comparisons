Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a group project in a biology lab where there's a foreign exchange student from South Korea whose English isn't very good. The author suggests using Google Translate to make communication easier. The other two girls get upset and call the author insensitive for excluding the student from their culture. The author thinks they were just trying to be efficient.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to help the group work more efficiently, which makes sense because if communication is a barrier, using a tool like Google Translate could save time and ensure everyone understands. The exchange student also nodded in agreement, so he seemed okay with the suggestion. That's a point in the author's favor.\n\nOn the other hand, the girls felt that using the translator was excluding the student from their culture. Maybe they thought that using a translator would create a barrier instead of a bridge, or perhaps they believed the student would prefer to try learning English or being included in the conversation without a tool. Cultural sensitivity is important, and sometimes people might perceive certain actions as disrespectful even if unintended. The girls' reaction is valid because they felt it was insensitive, even if that wasn't the author's intention.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the student could have been embarrassed or felt that the group didn't trust his ability to communicate. Even though he nodded, the girls might have felt that using the translator publicly in front of others could be demeaning. Alternatively, the problem could be that the author didn't consider the student's feelings or cultural norms about using translation tools. In some cultures, relying on translation might be seen as a last resort or something that's only necessary when there's a significant language gap, which could imply that the student isn't capable of communicating in English. \n\nBut the student did agree to use the translator, so maybe he felt comfortable with it. The author's action wasn't malicious and was meant to help. However, the author might not have considered the social dynamics and the cultural implications. The key here is whether the action was indeed insensitive, regardless of intent. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was that the other members of the group felt the student was being excluded. \n\nIt's possible that the girls were overreacting, but their feelings are real. The author should have maybe discussed it more carefully with the group beforehand or checked with the student in private if using a translator would make him feel excluded. The fact that the student nodded might not address the cultural aspect the girls are referring to. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to be efficient, the method might have unintentionally caused the student to feel marginalized. The girls' reaction is about cultural sensitivity, which the author might not have fully considered. So, the author might be in the wrong because even with good intentions, the action could have been seen as culturally insensitive. But it's a tough call. Alternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to solve a practical problem and the student agreed. The answer depends on weighing intentions against the perceived impact.\n"
