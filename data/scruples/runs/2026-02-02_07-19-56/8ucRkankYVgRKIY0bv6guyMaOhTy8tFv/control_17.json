Our professor had paired us all up and it was me, the foreign exchange student, and two girls. Our assignment was to build all the types of amino acids models with those little balls and rods and explain some stuff about them and we only had the one class to do it. We start talking and discussing what to do, and it becomes clear that the other guy's English isn't good. For efficiency's sake, I pull out my phone and open up Google translate and use it ask the guy if we can use Google translate so we can communicate easier for the time being. He smiles and nods. But in hearing what I asked him, the girls we're paired with start calling me an insensitive asshole and that I'm \"excluding him from our culture\". I didn't think I did anything wrong, I was just trying to make our group more efficient.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for suggesting using Google Translate to communicate with a Korean exchange student in their lab group. The situation is that the group had to build amino acid models quickly, and the student's English wasn't very good. The author used Google Translate to facilitate communication, which the other student agreed to, but the girls in the group accused the author of being insensitive and excluding the student from their culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent behind using Google Translate. The author's main goal was to increase efficiency, which makes sense given the time constraints of the class. The exchange student also smiled and nodded, indicating he was okay with the approach. So, from the author's perspective, they were trying to be helpful and practical.\n\nOn the other hand, the girls felt that using the translator was excluding the student. Maybe they thought that using the translator made the student feel like he wasn't part of the group's natural interaction, or perhaps they believed it was better to try to communicate in English even if it was challenging. Cultural sensitivity is important here. If the student was comfortable using the translator, then maybe there's no issue. However, if the student felt that the translator was being forced upon him, that could be a problem. \n\nBut the student did agree to use the translator, so that suggests he was okay with it. The author's action wasn't to exclude but to include by making communication easier. The girls' reaction might stem from a misunderstanding. The key points are the student's consent and the author's intention to help. The author isn't at fault here because they acted in good faith and the student was on board. The real issue might be the girls' perception, not the author's action.\n"
