I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (24f) is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. \n\nFirst, context: The author bought VIP tickets with a different friend who bailed last minute. She found another friend (30f) who was laid off and agreed to go. The band is a conceptual metal band with campy elements. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author finds unappealing and worries might reflect poorly on her because she's nervous about the event.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by not letting her friend wear the dress. \n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The author invited her friend to go to the concert, but it seems like the friend agreed on her own terms, including what to wear. The author didn't set any rules about attire beforehand. By the time the author says something, it's about to be the concert night, so the friend might have already bought the dress or prepared that way. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she's nervous about being associated with the band's style (campy metal) and not wanting to look stupid. However, the friend isn't part of the band or involved in the VIP meeting. The author's friend's attire is her own choice unless specified otherwise. The author might be projecting her own insecurities onto the friend.\n\nThe other friend said the author was being a jerk because the friend's outfit doesn't reflect on her. That makes sense because unless the author is the one organizing the event or the concert has a strict dress code, she doesn't have the authority to dictate what her companion wears. \n\nAlso, the friend agreed to go, so the author's last-minute comment about the dress could be seen as disrespectful. The author should have communicated any dress code expectations beforehand if she had any. Since she didn't, it's the friend's right to choose her outfit, even if the author doesn't like it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because she overstepped by imposing her preferences on her friend without prior agreement. The friend's choice of clothing is her own, and the author's concern about association is more about her own anxiety than a legitimate issue with the friend's attire.\n"
