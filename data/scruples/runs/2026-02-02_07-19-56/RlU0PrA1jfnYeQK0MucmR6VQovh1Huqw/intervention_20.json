I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The situation is that the author got VIP tickets and had to bring a last-minute friend. She told her friend about the band being a \"conceptual metal band with campiness,\" and the friend chose a Harley Quinn dress. The author doesn't like the dress and is worried about being associated with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When you invite someone to an event, especially a concert, you typically respect their choice of attire unless there's a specific dress code. The author didn't specify any dress code, so the friend might not have known to avoid certain styles. The author's concern is about being associated with the friend's outfit, which feels a bit self-centered. The friend's choice of dress isn't necessarily inappropriate unless the event had a specific theme that conflicts with it. \n\nThe author's friend might not know the band well, but that's okay because the author invited her at the last minute. The author did mention the band's style, but maybe the friend interpreted it differently. The author's main issue is with the Harley Quinn dress, but unless the band's theme is something that directly clashes (like a superhero theme), it's probably fine. The author is also paying for the tickets and the drive, which gives her some leeway, but it's still a social situation where mutual respect is important.\n\nThe other friend's opinion that the author is being a jerk makes sense because the friend's attire doesn't directly reflect on the author unless there's a strict dress code. The author's anxiety about looking stupid might be projecting her own insecurities onto the situation. It's possible that the author is overstepping by criticizing her friend's choice, even if she's worried about how the band might perceive it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her friend's fashion choice unless there was a clear reason not to wear the dress. The answer would be that she is in the wrong (A) because she shouldn't have dictated the friend's attire without a valid reason.\n"
