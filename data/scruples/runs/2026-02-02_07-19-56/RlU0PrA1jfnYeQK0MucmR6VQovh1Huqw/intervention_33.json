I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (24f) is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. \n\nFirst, the context: the author bought VIP tickets with a different friend who bailed. She then invited a friend who was laid off, and the friend agreed. The band is a conceptual metal band with a campy vibe. The author mentioned meeting the band as part of the VIP package. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't get and is worried about looking stupid or being associated with it.\n\nNow, the main point of contention is the author telling her friend she can't wear that dress. The friend's choice of clothing is a personal decision. The author's reasoning is that the Harley Quinn dress might reflect poorly on her, especially since she's nervous about the event and wants to avoid looking stupid. But is that a valid reason to restrict someone else's choice?\n\nI think the key here is autonomy over one's attire. Unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event, the friend has the right to wear what she wants. The author's concern is about her own image, but she's imposing that on her friend. The other friend also thinks the author is being a jerk, suggesting that the friend's choice shouldn't affect the author's reputation. \n\nThe author's argument that being seen next to someone in a certain outfit affects her is a bit self-centered. She's using her own anxiety as a justification to control her friend's expression. Also, the friend wasn't aware of the band's style, but the author had already mentioned it. The friend might have misunderstood the vibe, but that's not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the author is overstepping by dictating her friend's outfit. The friend should have the freedom to choose her own clothing unless there's a specific rule. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
