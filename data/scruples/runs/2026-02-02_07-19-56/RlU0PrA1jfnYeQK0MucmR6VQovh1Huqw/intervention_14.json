That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band.

I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author (24f) bought VIP tickets for their favorite band with a friend. When that friend bailed, they found another friend (30f) who was laid off and agreed to go. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band and that the band is conceptual metal with campy songs. The friend then chooses a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't get why people idolize her. The author is nervous about being associated with the event and the band's style, so they told their friend she can't wear the dress.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The author's main concern is about their own anxiety and not wanting to be associated with the band's style. The friend didn't put effort into knowing the band, but that's not the issue here. The issue is the choice of dress. The author is worried about being seen next to someone in that outfit and feeling like it reflects on them. The other friend said the author is being a jerk, suggesting that the friend's outfit shouldn't matter.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are autonomy over personal style, the author's right to set boundaries, and whether the situation justifies the request. The author paid for the tickets and is using the friend's time. However, the friend is an adult and has the right to dress however she wants unless there's a specific dress code. The author's reasoning is about their own discomfort and fear of association, which might be a personal issue. However, the author did warn the friend about the band's style, so maybe they had a valid reason to expect a different attire. But the friend might have misunderstood or chosen to go against that, thinking it was okay. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping by dictating what someone else can wear, even if they're attending an event together. Unless there's a strict rule, personal style is generally the individual's choice. The author's anxiety is a personal feeling, but that doesn't necessarily justify controlling another person's outfit. The friend might feel disrespected, and the author's request could be seen as imposing their own preferences without considering the friend's choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for trying to dictate the friend's attire based on their own insecurities. Unless there's a specific reason the band or venue prohibits such clothing, the author doesn't have the right to enforce a dress code. The friend's choice of dress, while perhaps not aligning with the band's aesthetic, is her own personal style decision. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting the friend's autonomy.\n"
