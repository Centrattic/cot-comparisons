I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend wearing a Harley Quinn dress to a concert for a conceptual metal band, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author bought VIP tickets with a friend who bailed, so they invited another friend who's laid off and has time. The other friend hasn't heard of the band and the author mentioned the band's campiness. The friend then chooses a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't like. The author is worried about being associated with the dress and might be embarrassed.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling the friend she can't wear the dress. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author's friend is allowed to wear what she wants, right? Unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event, the author can't control what others wear. The author's concern seems to be about their own embarrassment rather than the friend violating any rules. The author might not have the authority to dictate someone else's clothing choice just because they're going together.\n\nAlso, the author paid for the tickets and arranged the trip, but that doesn't give them the right to impose their preferences on the friend's attire. The friend might feel her choice of dress is appropriate, especially since she's not a fan of the band. The author's reaction could come off as controlling or judgmental. However, the author is also nervous and doesn't want to look stupid, which is a valid emotion. But it's about their own comfort versus the other person's autonomy.\n\nThe other friend said the author was being a jerk, which suggests that others might see the author's actions as overstepping. The key point is whether the author has the right to tell someone else what to wear. Since there's no event dress code, the author's refusal seems to be about personal preference, not a legitimate policy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for trying to control another person's clothing choice based on their own comfort, especially without a valid reason like an official dress code.\n"
