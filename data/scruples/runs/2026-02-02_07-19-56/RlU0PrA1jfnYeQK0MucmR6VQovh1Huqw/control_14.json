Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend wearing a Harley Quinn dress to a concert for a conceptual metal band, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author (24f) bought VIP tickets, a friend (30f) agreed to go with her after the original driver bailed. The band is described as having a campy, conceptual style. The friend didn't know the band and didn't put effort into learning about them. The author told her about the VIP meeting part and the band's style, but the friend took it too seriously. Now, the friend is wearing a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't like and is worried about being associated with it.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author has the right to tell her friend not to wear that dress. The author is concerned about looking stupid or being associated with the dress, even though they're just attending the concert together. The other friend says she's being a jerk because what the friend wears isn't the author's responsibility.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The friend agreed to go with her, but the author didn't specify dress code. The author mentioned the band's style, but maybe not the expectations for their own attire. The friend's choice might not align with the band's image, which the author is worried about. However, the author's friend is an adult and can choose her own clothing. The author's concern about being associated with the dress might be valid if they're standing next to each other, but it's also about the author's own insecurities rather than the friend's actions directly affecting others. \n\nThe author might be projecting their own anxiety onto the situation, but is that a valid reason to tell someone what to wear? It's a personal choice. Unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event, the author can't dictate what her friend wears. The friend wasn't aware of the band's details, so maybe the author should have communicated expectations earlier. The fact that the author didn't mention a dress code initially could mean she's being inconsistent now. \n\nAlso, the friend's choice of dress might not actually reflect the band's style. If Harley Quinn isn't related, maybe the author is misjudging. But the author is worried about being associated with it, which is her own perception. However, unless the friend's outfit is causing direct harm or violating event rules, it's more about the author's personal feelings. \n\nIn social situations, people have the right to dress as they please. The author's request to not wear the dress could be seen as controlling or overly concerned with appearances. The other friend's comment that it's not the author's responsibility supports this view. So, the author might be in the wrong for trying to dictate her friend's clothing choice based on her own insecurities rather than any actual rule or harm.\n"
