I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author (24F) bought VIP tickets to see their favorite band with a different friend, but that friend bailed last minute. They then invited another friend (30F) who's laid off and has time. The friend agreed. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band, and the band is a conceptual metal group with campy songs. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author finds odd because they don't get why people idolize Harley Quinn. The author is worried about being associated with the dress because they're nervous about the event. Their other friend said they're being a jerk, but the author is concerned about being seen next to her all night.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is worried about their own image and association with the friend's choice of attire. The friend didn't put effort into learning about the band, but the author didn't specify that the dress was inappropriate for the event. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that request.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because they invited the friend to go with them, and the friend isn't obligated to dress a certain way unless the event specifies. The author's concern about being associated with the dress might be about their own insecurities rather than the friend's dress being actually inappropriate. Also, the author didn't set any dress code beforehand, so the friend's choice, while maybe unexpected, isn't necessarily wrong. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling or projecting their own nerves onto the situation. However, maybe there's a context where the band's style is very specific, but the author didn't clarify that properly. But since the author didn't enforce a dress code and the friend agreed to go, the author might be overstepping by policing the friend's attire. So the answer might be A (in the wrong). Alternatively, if the author felt the dress was against the event's vibe, but since they didn't mention it before, maybe not. Hmm. It's a bit of a judgment call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of their own insecurity and lack of prior communication about dress code.\n"
