I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear the Harley Quinn dress to the concert.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought VIP tickets with a friend who bailed last minute. She then invited another friend who was laid off and agreed to go. The friend hasn't heard of the band, and the author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band, who are a \"conceptual metal band\" with campiness. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress from Hot Topic. The author is worried about being associated with the dress and the band's style, so she told her friend she can't wear it. Her other friend said she was being a jerk because what the friend wears doesn't reflect on her, but the author is worried she'll look bad next to her.\n\nHmm. So the key points are: the author is concerned about her own image at the concert, thinking that the Harley Quinn dress is too associated with the band's style (which she's nervous about). But the friend chose the dress independently. The author is not the one organizing the event, just attending with someone. She paid for the tickets because the original friend bailed, and now she's asking the new friend to dress a certain way.\n\nIs it her place to tell her friend what to wear? Friends can have different styles. The author might feel self-conscious, but telling someone they can't wear something they chose could be overstepping. The friend agreed to go along, and while the author mentioned the band's style, the friend might not have taken it as a dress code. The author's concern is about her own perception, but the friend has the right to choose her own outfit. Unless there's an actual dress code from the event, which isn't mentioned, the author's actions seem to impose her preferences on the friend. The friend might also feel disrespected if she's not allowed to wear her own choice. So maybe the author is in the wrong for trying to control her friend's attire based on her own insecurities.\n"
