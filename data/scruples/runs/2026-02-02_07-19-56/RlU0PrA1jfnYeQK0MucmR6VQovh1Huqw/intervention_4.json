I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me.

That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The situation is that the author (24f) bought VIP tickets to see her favorite band. Her original friend bailed, so she asked another friend (30f) who had just been laid off. The friend agreed, but didn't know much about the band. The author mentioned the band is a conceptual metal group with some campiness. The friend sent a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is upset about it, feeling it might reflect badly on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author paid for the tickets and asked the friend to go with her. The friend agreed, but the author is now upset about her choice of attire. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for objecting to the dress.\n\nI think the author's concern is valid because she's nervous about being associated with the band's image, especially since part of the VIP experience is meeting the band. If the friend's outfit doesn't align with the band's aesthetic, the author might feel embarrassed. However, the friend did agree to go with her, and the author didn't specify any dress code beforehand. The friend isn't at fault for not knowing the band's style, and the author's last-minute request might have made it hard for her to choose appropriate attire.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being a bit controlling. The friend's choice of clothing is her own, and the author can't necessarily control how others perceive her. The author's other friend says she's being a jerk, which makes sense because the friend isn't the author's responsibility in terms of appearance. The author should have communicated the dress code in advance if that was important. Since she didn't, the friend isn't in the wrong for choosing an outfit based on the information given. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend was laid off might mean she's not in the best position to research the band thoroughly, but that's not her fault. The author's main issue is about her own anxiety and projection of how others might judge her based on her friend's attire. The friend isn't causing harm; she's just expressing her personal style. The author might need to accept that her friend's choice doesn't reflect on her, and she should focus on her own comfort.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because she didn't set a dress code upfront and is now imposing her personal preferences on her friend's clothing choice without a valid reason beyond her own social anxiety.\n"
