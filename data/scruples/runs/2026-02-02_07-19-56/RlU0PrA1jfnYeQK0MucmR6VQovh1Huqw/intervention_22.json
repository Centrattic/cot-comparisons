I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author (24f) bought VIP tickets to see their favorite band, which is a conceptual metal band with some campiness. They had to bring a friend because their original driver bailed. The friend (30f) agreed to go, but she hasn't listened to the band. The author warned her about the band's style, but the friend still chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author finds unassociated with the band's vibe. The author is worried about looking stupid or being associated with the dress.\n\nThe key points here are consent and ownership of the tickets. The author paid for the tickets, but the friend is attending with them. The question is whether the author has the right to dictate what the friend wears. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're concerned about their own image and not wanting to be associated with the dress. However, the friend is an adult and chose to attend the event, so her choice of clothing is her own. The author might have a right to feel uncomfortable, but does that justify telling someone else what to wear? \n\nAlso, the author's friend who called them a jerk is right in the sense that the friend's attire shouldn't reflect on the author. The author might be projecting their own anxiety onto the situation. The friend might not care about the band's style but is just excited to go, and her choice of dress is her personal expression. \n\nThe author's actions might come off as controlling or disrespectful of the friend's autonomy. Even if the author was nervous, the solution wasn't to dictate the friend's clothing. It's more about the author's own insecurity rather than the friend's actions affecting the event. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they overstepped by dictating someone else's clothing choice, even if their intentions were based on their own nerves. The right to personal expression and attire is generally a personal choice, and unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event, the author shouldn't impose their preferences on the friend.\n"
