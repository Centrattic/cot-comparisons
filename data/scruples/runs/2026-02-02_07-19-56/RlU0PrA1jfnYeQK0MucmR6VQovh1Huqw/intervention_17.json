I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author bought VIP tickets with another friend who bailed, so she had to bring a different friend (her 30f friend). The author is nervous about the event, mentions that the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs. She told her friend about the VIP meeting the band part and the band's style. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is upset because she doesn't like the dress and is worried about being associated with it.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for objecting to her friend's dress choice. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to express her preference, but she's asking her friend to change what she's wearing. The friend agreed to go with her because she's available, so maybe the author is imposing her standards. The author's friend might feel that her choice of dress is her own business, especially since she wasn't aware of the band's style beforehand. The author's main concern is about not looking stupid or being associated with the band's style, but if the friend isn't part of the band's fandom, maybe the author's concern is misplaced. \n\nAlso, the author's other friend said she was being a jerk, which adds weight to the idea that the author is overstepping. The friend's attire doesn't necessarily reflect on the author unless the band's style is directly linked to the dress, which might not be the case. The author might be projecting her own anxiety onto the friend's choice, making it a personal issue rather than the friend's fault. \n\nHowever, the author did mention the band's style and the VIP meeting part, so maybe she had a reason to expect certain attire. But the friend didn't put effort into learning about the band, so perhaps she didn't take the event seriously. Still, the dress choice is a personal style decision. \n\nIn the end, it's about respecting boundaries. The author can express her discomfort but can't control her friend's clothing unless it's against the venue's policy. Since the venue isn't mentioned, the author might be overreacting. The friend isn't responsible for the author's embarrassment. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
