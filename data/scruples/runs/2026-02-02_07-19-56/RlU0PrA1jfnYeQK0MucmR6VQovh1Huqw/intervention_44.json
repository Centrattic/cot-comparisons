That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author needed a last-minute date for a VIP concert with a metal band that's conceptual and campy. She found a friend who was laid off and had time. The friend agreed but didn't know the band. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band. The friend then sent a Harley Quinn dress photo. The author is worried about being associated with the dress and the band's image, so she told her friend not to wear it. The friend's other person says the author is a jerk because the dress isn't her choice to make. The author feels the dress might make her look stupid if she's near it.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author paid for the tickets and drove, so she's in a position of responsibility. She's nervous about the event and wants to avoid looking bad. The friend didn't do research on the band, but she agreed to go. The author's concern is about association and image. But is that valid?\n\nThe key points: The author is the one who invited the friend, so she's responsible for their shared experience. The VIP package is part of the event, so the audience's attire should be considered. The friend's choice of dress, inspired by a pop culture character, might clash with the band's image, which is metal and campy. The author is worried about being associated with it because they'll be next to each other all night. But is it her place to police her friend's clothing? \n\nThe friend's choice is personal expression. Unless the venue or VIP package has a dress code, the author can't control what others wear. The author's main issue is her own anxiety about looking stupid, which might be projection. The friend isn't the one meeting the band; the author is. But the author's concern is that the dress will reflect poorly on her association. \n\nHowever, the friend is attending as a guest, and the author's role is to accompany her. The author's nervousness shouldn't infringe on the friend's freedom of expression. The author could have expressed her discomfort without dictating the friend's outfit. Maybe suggesting a different style or discussing expectations earlier would have been better. But after the fact, telling the friend not to wear it is controlling. \n\nThe other friend says the author is being a jerk, which makes sense because the dress choice is the friend's. The author's actions are based on her own insecurities rather than any real issue with the dress. So, the author is in the wrong for overstepping and policing her friend's attire. Answer A.\n"
