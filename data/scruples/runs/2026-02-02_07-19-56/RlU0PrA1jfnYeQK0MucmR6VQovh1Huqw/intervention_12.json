Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend not to wear the Harley Quinn dress to a concert. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author needed a last-minute companion for a VIP concert because their original friend bailed. The friend agreed to go, even though she hasn't heard of the band. The author mentioned the band is a \"conceptual metal band\" with campiness, which the friend might have taken too seriously. Then, when the friend sends a Harley Quinn dress, the author objects because they don't want to be associated with that image and feel judged.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and the expectations of the event. The author is worried that the friend's choice of clothing might make them look bad or be associated with something the author doesn't like. The friend, on the other hand, agreed to go last minute and might have chosen the dress without full understanding of the band's vibe.\n\nThe author's friend says they're being a jerk, arguing that the friend's attire isn't the author's responsibility. The author's concern is about their own comfort and avoiding embarrassment. However, the friend was asked at the last minute and might not have had enough time or information to choose appropriate attire based on the event's theme. \n\nHarley Quinn is a character from DC Comics, often associated with a gothic or edgy style, which might clash with a metal band's aesthetic. The author's issue is about the appearance and association, not the friend's actual behavior. The author is prioritizing their own nervousness and wanting to avoid being judged by others at the event.\n\nBut is it the author's place to dictate what their friend wears? The friend agreed to accompany them, but did the author make it clear about the dress code or the band's style early enough? The author mentioned the VIP package and the band's conceptual nature, but maybe not explicitly the clothing expectations. The friend might have made the dress choice based on her own interpretation of what's appropriate for a concert, not knowing it's a metal band with a certain aesthetic.\n\nAlso, the author paid for the tickets, which could be a factor in their sense of control over the situation. However, the friend is an adult and has the right to choose her own clothing. The author's concern about being associated with the friend's attire is a personal feeling, but it's not the friend's responsibility to dress in a way that makes the author comfortable unless it's explicitly agreed upon.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common to have preferences about how others dress when you're together, unless there's a specific dress code (like formal or casual), it's generally up to each individual. The author might have overstepped by dictating the friend's choice, especially since the friend was a last-minute replacement and might not have been fully briefed on the band's vibe.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. They didn't clearly communicate the expectations about clothing, and while they have a right to feel nervous, they can't control the friend's attire. The friend isn't responsible for the author's embarrassment unless it's a direct violation of event rules. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being clear about the dress code and for judging the friend's choice.\n"
