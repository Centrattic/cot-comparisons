That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 24-year-old woman, bought VIP tickets to a concert with a friend who bailed last minute. She ended up going with another friend, who's 30 and recently laid off. The author told her friend about the VIP part involving meeting the band and that the band is a conceptual metal group with campy songs. The friend wore a Harley Quinn dress from Hot Topic.\n\nThe author is upset because she's nervous about the event and doesn't want to look stupid or be associated with the band in a negative way. Her other friend says she's being a jerk, but she's worried about being seen next to someone in a dress that might clash with the band's vibe. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has a right to be concerned. She paid for the tickets and had to scramble to find a last-minute companion. The friend didn't know the band and didn't put effort into learning about them, which the author mentioned. But the friend chose an outfit that the author finds inappropriate or not in line with the band's style. \n\nThe author's friend was laid off and had the time to go, which is why she was available. The author didn't specify any dress code beforehand, so the friend probably didn't know to avoid certain styles. The author's main issue is the fear of being associated with the band's image if her friend's outfit is too \"Harley Quinn,\" which the author dislikes. \n\nNow, is the author being unreasonable? The friend was invited last minute, so the author might not have had time to set expectations about clothing. The friend's choice of dress might not directly relate to the band's style, but the author is worried about being seen next to her. The other friend says it's not the author's problem, but the author is concerned about her own comfort and image. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to police her friend's outfit? The friend might not have realized that the band's aesthetic is important to the author. The author did mention the conceptual and campy aspects, but the friend might not have connected that to clothing choices. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't specify a dress code, so the friend's choice wasn't inappropriate unless the event had strict rules. The author's nervousness might be causing her to overreact. The fact that the friend is wearing a popular character's dress (Harley Quinn) might not be related to the band at all. \n\nSo, the author is being considerate about her own feelings and image, but is she being a jerk by policing her friend's choice? Friends should respect each other's preferences, but also have boundaries. However, in this case, since there's no dress code, the friend's choice is her own. The author should have communicated her preferences if she had any, but she didn't. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not setting expectations earlier and for judging her friend's outfit, which was chosen without prior knowledge of the band's style.\n"
