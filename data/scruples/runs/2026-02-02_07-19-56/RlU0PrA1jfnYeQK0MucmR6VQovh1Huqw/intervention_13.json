I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend wearing a Harley Quinn dress to a concert, and the author is telling her she can't. The author is nervous about being associated with the band since they're a \"conceptual metal band with campiness,\" and the friend didn't know much about them.\n\nFirst, the friend agreed to go because the original plans fell through. The author paid for the tickets, so maybe there's an expectation of certain behavior. But does the author have the right to dictate someone else's clothing choice? The friend's dress choice seems like a personal expression. The author is worried about looking stupid by association. But is that a valid reason to tell someone they can't wear something?\n\nThe author mentioned the VIP package includes meeting the band. If the band has specific dress codes, maybe there's a reason. But the author didn't specify if there's an official dress code. If it's just their own anxiety, that's different. The friend's choice of clothing might not reflect on the author. The other friend said the author was being a jerk, implying the author's judgment is unwarranted.\n\nAlso, the author's friend was laid off and agreed to go because they had time. The author might be overstepping by controlling her attire. Unless there's a specific rule against it, the author has no authority to enforce a dress code. The author's nervousness might be projecting onto others. So, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's choice and letting personal anxiety affect the friend's autonomy.\n"
