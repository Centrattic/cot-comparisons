Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nSo, the situation: The author (24F) bought VIP tickets for her favorite band, paid for them with a friend. The original friend bailed, so she asked another friend (30F) to go instead. The friend agreed, even though she hadn't heard of the band. The author mentioned that part of the VIP package includes meeting the band, and the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs. The friend took that seriously. Now, the friend wants to wear a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is upset because she doesn't like the character and is worried about being associated with it during the event.\n\nFirst, considering the context: The author is worried about looking stupid or being associated with something she doesn't like, given that the VIP experience might involve meeting the band. The friend's choice of dress is unrelated to the band, but the author feels it reflects badly on her. The friend's other friend says the author is being a jerk because others' attire isn't her responsibility.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend is allowed to wear what she wants. The author might be projecting her own discomfort onto the situation. She invited the friend, so she could have set expectations earlier. By not doing so, the friend isn't obligated to conform. The author's concern about association might be valid in a professional setting, but this is a personal event. The friend's dress choice is her own, and the author should respect that unless there were specific dress code restrictions. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling or not respecting the friend's autonomy. However, she might have a genuine reason if meeting the band requires a certain image. But since the friend isn't part of the band, the author's association with the dress might not matter. So, the answer might be A (the author is wrong) because she's overstepping by dictating someone else's clothing choice unless there's a specific rule. Alternatively, B (not wrong) if she's within her rights to express her discomfort. But considering autonomy, probably A.\n"
