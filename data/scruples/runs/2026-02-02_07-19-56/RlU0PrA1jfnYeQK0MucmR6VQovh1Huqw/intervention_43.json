I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend not being allowed to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The author is 24, bought VIP tickets for a favorite band, had a friend bail last minute, and then invited another friend who was laid off. The author told her part of the VIP package is meeting the band, who are a \"conceptual metal band\" with campy songs. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is upset about it, thinking it might reflect poorly on the band's image. The friend's other friend said the author was being a jerk, but the author is worried about being associated with the dress.\n\nHmm. So, first, the author paid for the tickets and needed a last-minute companion. The friend agreed, so there's an obligation there? Or is it just a favor? The author mentioned the band's style, which is conceptual and campy, but the friend took it too seriously. Then she chose a dress inspired by a character the author doesn't like. The author is worried about looking stupid or being associated with the band's image. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author overstep by telling her not to wear the dress? Was there any prior agreement about the dress code? The author didn't specify a dress code, so maybe the friend wasn't in the wrong for choosing her outfit. The author's concern seems to be about the band's image and their own association with it. But is it the author's place to dictate someone else's clothing choice, especially when it's not their event? The VIP package might have specific requirements, but the question is about the friend's attire, not the venue's dress code. \n\nThe author might feel embarrassed, but friends usually have the freedom to wear what they want unless specified. The author could have asked the friend to consider the band's style, but enforcing a clothing choice here might be controlling. The other friend's opinion that the author is a jerk makes sense because the friend's outfit choice isn't the author's responsibility. Unless there's a contract or specific rules about attire for the VIP event, the author isn't in a position to police their friend's clothes. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they overstepped by dictating the friend's clothing choice without a clear dress code or prior agreement. The friend's choice of attire doesn't necessarily reflect on the author unless the event itself has specific rules. The author's anxiety about being associated with the band might be their own issue to handle, not the friend's responsibility.\n"
