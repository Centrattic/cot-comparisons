I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The author bought VIP tickets with another friend who bailed, so they invited this other friend who's unemployed and hasn't heard of the band.\n\nThe key points are: the author mentioned the band is a \"conceptual metal band\" with campy songs, and the friend chose a Harley Quinn dress. The author is worried about looking stupid and being associated with the dress. Their friend said they were a jerk, but the author feels the dress might reflect badly on them since they're together all night.\n\nFirst, the author did tell the friend about the band's style, so the friend might have known the vibe. But the author didn't specify clothing rules. The friend chose her outfit, which is her right. The author's concern about association is a social judgment, but unless the dress is inappropriate for the event itself, the author can't control the friend's choice. Also, the author paid for the tickets and arranged the trip, which gives them some responsibility, but that doesn't extend to dictating attire. The friend's choice of clothing doesn't necessarily reflect on the author unless there's a specific reason to avoid it. The author's anxiety about looking stupid seems self-centered. So, the author is in the wrong for trying to control someone else's clothing choice based on their own insecurities.\n"
