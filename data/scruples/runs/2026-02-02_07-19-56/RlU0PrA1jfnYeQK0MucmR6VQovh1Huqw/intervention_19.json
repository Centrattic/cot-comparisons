I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the 24-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought VIP tickets for her favorite band, paid for them when her original friend drove. Her friend bailed last minute, so she asked another friend (who's been laid off) to go. The friend agreed. The author mentioned that part of the VIP package is meeting the band, and the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress from Hot Topic. The author is nervous about the event and not wanting to be associated with something that might look stupid because of the dress. Her other friend said she was being a jerk, arguing that what the friend wears isn't the author's responsibility, but the author feels that being next to her all night might reflect badly on her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's responsibility over her friend's attire, the potential embarrassment, and the social dynamics.\n\nThe author is paying for the tickets and the friend is going with her. She's allowed the friend to come because she needed a last-minute companion. However, the author now feels that the friend's choice of clothing (Harley Quinn) could be embarrassing, especially since the band is conceptual metal with campy elements. The author might perceive Harley Quinn as not in line with the band's style, or maybe she thinks Harley Quinn is associated with something that could clash with the band's image. Alternatively, maybe she's worried that others at the concert might perceive the Harley Quinn dress as inappropriate or not in line with the band's vibe.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her friend not to wear that dress. Let's consider social norms and personal boundaries. When someone invites a friend to an event they're paying for, there's an expectation of mutual respect. However, the friend's choice of clothing is a personal decision. The author isn't the one choosing the attire for the friend; the friend made her own choice. The author might feel that her image is tied to the friend's appearance, but in reality, the friend is an adult and is responsible for her own choices. \n\nThe author's friend agreed to go, so there's an implicit agreement that the friend is coming as is. The author might be overstepping by dictating the friend's outfit, especially if the friend isn't part of the fanbase and didn't do research. However, the author could also argue that since she's paying and they're attending together, she wants to avoid embarrassment. \n\nBut is it the author's place to control her friend's clothing? In social settings, unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event, attendees usually choose their own outfits. The author might not have communicated a dress code, so the friend had no reason to know there was an expectation. The author's concern might stem from her own anxiety, but it's not the friend's responsibility to adjust her attire to alleviate that. \n\nAdditionally, the author's justification about the band's campiness might not necessarily conflict with Harley Quinn. If the band is conceptual and campy, maybe Harley Quinn's edgy look is actually appropriate. The author's discomfort could be personal, not based on the event's actual requirements. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be overstepping by trying to control her friend's clothing choice. Friends should respect each other's autonomy in such matters unless there's a clear reason it's inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for trying to dictate her friend's outfit without a valid reason.\n"
