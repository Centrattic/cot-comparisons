I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend wanting to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The author of the question is worried that the dress might reflect poorly on them because the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author invited a friend who was laid off to join them after another friend bailed. The friend didn't know about the band, and the author mentioned the VIP aspect and the band's style. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't understand, and they're worried about looking bad because of it. The other friend says the author is being a jerk, but the author feels that being next to someone in that outfit all night might reflect on them.\n\nNow, considering social norms and personal responsibility. The author paid for the tickets, which might give them some say in the arrangement, but the friend agreed to go. The author did mention the band's style, but the friend might have misunderstood. The issue is about personal choice in clothing. The author is concerned about association, but shouldn't they have discussed expectations earlier? If they were nervous, maybe they should have set clearer boundaries beforehand. However, the friend's choice of clothing is her own, and the author might be overstepping by dictating what she can wear unless there were specific rules they communicated. Also, the friend's choice of Harley Quinn might not be related to the band's theme, so the author's concern about looking bad might be unfounded. The author might be projecting their own insecurities onto the situation. The other friend's point is valid\u2014others might not associate the dress with the author. So, the author could be in the wrong for trying to control another person's choice based on their own anxiety without considering the friend's autonomy. Alternatively, if the VIP event had a dress code, maybe it's justified, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
