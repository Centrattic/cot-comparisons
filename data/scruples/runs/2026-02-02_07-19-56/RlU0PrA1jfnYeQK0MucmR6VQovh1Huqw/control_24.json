I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the context: The author (24f) bought VIP tickets for her favorite band, which were originally supposed to go with another friend who bailed. She then invited her friend (30f) who was laid off and had time. The friend agreed. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band, and that the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs. The friend, who hadn't heard of the band, interpreted that too seriously. Now, the friend wants to wear a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is uncomfortable because she doesn't like the character and is worried about looking stupid or being associated with it during the event. Her other friend says she's being a jerk, but the author feels that standing next to her in that dress might reflect badly on her.\n\nSo, the main issue is about dress code and personal choice. The author is concerned about her own image, but the friend is choosing her outfit. The question is whether the author has the right to tell her friend what to wear.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author did not set a dress code beforehand. The friend is an adult and has the right to choose her own attire. The author's reason is based on her own discomfort and fear of being associated with that image, but it's not the friend's fault she chose that dress. The author is essentially imposing her personal preferences on her friend without a valid reason beyond her own insecurities. The friend's other friend points out that what she wears isn't the author's responsibility, which makes sense because unless there's a specific dress code from the event that the author is enforcing (which there's no mention of), the author doesn't have the right to dictate her friend's clothing. The author's concern about being associated with it because they're standing next to each other might be overstated. It's possible the author is being overly self-conscious and not respecting her friend's choice. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
