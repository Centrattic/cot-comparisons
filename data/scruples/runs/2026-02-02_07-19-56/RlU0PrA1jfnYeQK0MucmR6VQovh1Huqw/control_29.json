I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author (24f) bought VIP tickets to her favorite band's concert with a friend who bailed last minute. She ended up going with another friend (30f) who had just been laid off and had time. The author mentioned that part of the VIP experience was meeting the band, and the band is a conceptual metal group with campy songs. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't like because it's associated with a character she doesn't care for. The author is worried about being associated with it and looking stupid. Another friend told her she's being a jerk, but she's concerned about standing next to her friend all night.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author didn't like the dress choice because it's linked to a character she finds unappealing, and she's worried about her own image. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if she has a right to dictate her friend's attire. The friend agreed to go with her, but the author didn't specify any dress code beforehand. The VIP package's meeting part might be a factor, but the band is metal with campiness, maybe not directly related to Harley Quinn. The author's reasoning is about not wanting to be associated with something she dislikes, but it's her own choice to go to the concert. However, she's taking a stance on her friend's clothing, which is a personal choice.\n\nThe other friend says she's being a jerk because the friend's attire shouldn't reflect on her. The author is concerned about being judged based on her friend's choice. But is it fair for her to control her friend's outfit? The friend agreed to go, so maybe the author should accept her style. The author's anxiety about the event might be affecting her judgment. She's asking to control her friend's appearance to avoid embarrassment, which might be overstepping.\n\nAlso, the friend didn't know much about the band, but the author gave her info. The friend's choice of dress might not be relevant. The author's main issue is with Harley Quinn, not the band's style. So, the author is projecting her dislike onto the situation. It's possible she's being overly sensitive and is in the wrong for not respecting her friend's choice. So the answer is A, she's in the wrong.\n"
