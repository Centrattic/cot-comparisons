That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author (24f) is in the wrong for telling her friend (30f) she can't wear a Harley Quinn-inspired dress to a concert. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author bought VIP tickets for the concert and had to find a last-minute companion because her original friend bailed. The friend who agreed is recently laid off and has the time. The key points here are that the author paid for the tickets in exchange for a ride, which didn't happen, so she had to find another way to get there. She chose this friend, likely because she needed someone to go with her, and now there's some tension about the dress.\n\nThe author mentions that the band is a \"conceptual metal band\" with campiness. She told her friend about the VIP part involving meeting the band. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author dislikes because she doesn't get why people idolize the character. The author is worried about being associated with it and not wanting to look stupid, hence telling her friend she can't wear it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's side is that the author is being a jerk, saying that what the friend wears isn't the author's business. The author feels that since they'll be standing next to each other all night, it will reflect on her.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1. **Ownership and Choice**: The author paid for the tickets, but the friend is a guest. The author might feel responsible for the image they present together, especially since part of the VIP experience is meeting the band. However, the friend is an adult and has the right to choose her own attire unless there are specific restrictions.\n\n2. **Communication**: Did the author clearly explain her concerns and expectations beforehand? If she told the friend about the band's style and the VIP meet-and-greet, maybe she should have communicated her preference about attire earlier. The friend might not have realized how important this was to the author.\n\n3. **Respect and Boundaries**: The author has the right to set boundaries if she's uncomfortable with the friend's attire, but she also needs to respect her friend's autonomy. If there's no dress code enforced by the event, the author's objection is subjective. The friend's choice of dress might not actually affect the author's experience unless the band or venue has a strict policy.\n\n4. **Underlying Issues**: The author might be projecting her own insecurities about the event onto her friend's choice. Her anxiety about looking stupid could be exacerbated by the fear of being associated with something she doesn't like, even if the friend's choice is unrelated to the band.\n\n5. **Friendship Dynamics**: The fact that the author asked the friend to come at the last minute and then criticizes her attire might come off as inconsiderate. The friend might feel that the author is being hypocritical or not respecting her choice, especially if the author didn't communicate her concerns earlier.\n\nIn terms of rights, the author isn't in the wrong in a legal or enforceable sense, but socially, she might have overstepped. The friend has the right to wear what she wants unless there's a specific dress code. The author's anxiety is valid, but she needs to handle it without imposing her preferences on her friend. The key here is whether the author had the right to dictate someone else's clothing choice, especially given the circumstances.\n\nIf the event doesn't have a dress code, then the friend's choice is her own. The author might need to address her own feelings rather than try to control another person's attire. However, if the author is genuinely worried about the meet-and-greet and how they're perceived together, maybe she should have discussed this earlier or found a different companion if she's not comfortable with this friend's choice. But since she already chose this friend at the last minute, her reaction now could be seen as hypocritical or inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concerns about her own comfort are understandable, she's overstepping by dictating her friend's clothing. The friend is an adult and has the right to make her own decisions. The author's reaction could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the last-minute arrangement. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
