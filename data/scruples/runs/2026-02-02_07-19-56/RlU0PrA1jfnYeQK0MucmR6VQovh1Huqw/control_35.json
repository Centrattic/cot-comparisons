I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author bought VIP tickets for their favorite band, had to find a last-minute date when their original plan fell through, and their friend agreed to go. The friend hasn't heard of the band and didn't put effort into researching them. The author mentioned the VIP package includes meeting the band, and the band is a \"conceptual metal band\" with some campiness. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author finds uncool, and the author is worried about being associated with that look.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is anxious about the event and wants to avoid looking silly, especially since they paid for the tickets and the VIP experience. They're worried that their friend's outfit might reflect poorly on them. The other friend says the author is being a jerk because the friend's choice isn't the author's responsibility.\n\nFrom a social perspective, people have the right to dress as they please unless there's a specific dress code. The author hasn't mentioned any rules against the dress code, so the friend's choice isn't violating any event policies. The author's concern is about their own perception and association. While it's understandable to feel self-conscious, the author is making a judgment about their friend's attire, which might be overstepping. The friend was a last-minute replacement, and the author's anxiety might be contributing to this conflict. However, the author didn't set any expectations about clothing beforehand, so they can't reasonably expect the friend to conform to their preferences without a valid reason. The friend's choice of dress is her own, and the author shouldn't impose their standards unless there's a specific requirement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're trying to control their friend's appearance without justification, which is not respectful of the friend's autonomy.\n"
