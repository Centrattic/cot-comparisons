I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend wearing a Harley Quinn dress to a concert with a metal band that has a certain campy aesthetic. The author didn't want to be associated with that style, so they told their friend she can't wear the dress.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author bought VIP tickets because their original friend bailed. They found another friend who was unemployed and could go. They mentioned that the band is conceptual metal with campiness, and the friend didn't know the band. The author told her about the VIP meet-and-greet part. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress from Hot Topic, which the author finds unappealing. The author is worried about being associated with that style and thinks the friend took the \"campiness\" too seriously. Another friend says the author is being a jerk because the friend's outfit isn't their business.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author is responsible for the tickets and the drive, so they might have a sense of responsibility. However, the friend they're bringing is not their original choice; they had to scramble. The friend didn't know the band beforehand, but the author had given some context. The friend's choice of dress could be seen as not aligning with the band's style, which the author is concerned about.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author has the right to dictate someone else's clothing. In general, people have the right to wear what they want unless there's a specific dress code. The author didn't set a dress code, so the friend's choice is her own. The author's concern is about their own comfort and not wanting to be associated with the style. However, they are making a judgment about the friend's choice based on their own preferences. The other friend points out that the author can't control the friend's outfit, which is valid. Also, the author's friend might be trying to be fun or embrace the campy aspect, which the author had mentioned.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as controlling or judgmental. They might not have considered that the friend's choice is her own, even if it doesn't align with the band's style. The author's anxiety about looking stupid might be leading them to project that onto their friend's choice. However, the author is paying for the tickets and the drive, which could add pressure. But that doesn't necessarily give them authority over the friend's attire.\n\nIn terms of social norms, unless there's a specific rule against it, the friend's choice is her own. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping. The fact that another friend called them a jerk supports the idea that the author is being too controlling. The author's worry about association might be valid in terms of their own comfort, but they need to respect the friend's autonomy. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're imposing their preferences on someone else without a valid reason.\n"
