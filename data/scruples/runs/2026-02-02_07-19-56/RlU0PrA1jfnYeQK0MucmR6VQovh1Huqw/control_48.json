I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she asked her friend to go to a concert with her because her original date bailed. The friend agreed, even though she's never heard of the band. The band is a \"conceptual metal\" group with some campy songs. The author mentioned that part of the VIP package is meeting the band, and she also told her friend about the band's style.\n\nNow, the friend chose to wear a Harley Quinn dress from Hot Topic. The author is upset about this because she doesn't get why people like Harley Quinn, and she's worried that being seen next to someone in that dress will make her look stupid or associate her with that style. Her friend thinks she's being a jerk, saying that what the other person wears isn't her problem.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The author paid for the tickets, so maybe she feels responsible for the experience. She's nervous and wants to avoid any embarrassment. The friend is wearing a dress that's inspired by a pop culture character (Harley Quinn), which is a bit of a rebellious or edgy look. The author is worried that this choice reflects poorly on her since they'll be standing next to each other all night.\n\nBut wait, the friend wasn't really into the band, so maybe she's not trying to make a statement about the band's style. The author mentioned the band's \"campiness,\" but the friend might not understand that. However, the author also said she told her about the band's style. So maybe the friend didn't take that into account when choosing her outfit.\n\nBut is it the author's place to dictate what her friend wears? The friend agreed to go with her, but the choice of clothing is personal. The author is worried about being associated with the dress, but if the band isn't related to Harley Quinn, then the author's concern is about her own perception rather than the friend's. The friend's dress choice is her own, and unless the event had specific dress code requirements, the author can't control that.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for objecting is her own discomfort and fear of embarrassment, not any rule or policy. The friend isn't doing anything wrong by expressing herself through clothing. The author might have overstepped by telling her she can't wear it, especially if it wasn't against any event rules. The other friend thinks she's being a jerk because clothing choices are personal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong because she's imposing her own preferences on her friend's personal choice without valid grounds. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
