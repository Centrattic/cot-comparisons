That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (24F) bought VIP tickets to see their favorite band. The original driver bailed, so they asked a friend (30F) who's unemployed to go with them. The friend agreed. The band is a conceptual metal group with campy songs. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is worried about being associated with that look, thinking it might not fit the band's vibe. They feel the friend took the concept too seriously, but the friend's other friend says the author is being a jerk.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider points. The author had to scramble to find a last-minute companion, which might have added stress. The friend didn't know the band and hadn't put effort into learning about them. The author gave some context about the band's style, but maybe the friend took it the wrong way. The dress choice is a personal expression, and the author is concerned about their own image. However, the author is paying for the tickets and driving, which could create a dynamic where they feel responsible for the friend's image. But is it right to tell someone what to wear? The friend's choice is her own, and the author might be overstepping. The other friend's comment suggests the author is being too controlling. The author's anxiety about being associated with the look could be valid, but it's not the friend's responsibility to avoid that. The key issue is whether the author had the right to dictate the friend's attire. Since the friend is a guest, the author should probably respect her choice, even if they disagree. The author's concern is about their own image, which is a personal issue, not the friend's fault. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong for trying to control another adult's clothing choice.\n"
