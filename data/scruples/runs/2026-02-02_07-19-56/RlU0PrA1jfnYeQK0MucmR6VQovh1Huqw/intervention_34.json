That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the author is right to tell their friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author is 24, bought VIP tickets with another friend who bailed last minute. They asked a recently laid-off friend (30f) to go instead. The friend agreed. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band, which is a conceptual metal band with some campiness. The friend then sends a picture of a Harley Quinn dress. The author doesn't like the dress because they're worried about being associated with it since they paid for the tickets and want to avoid looking \"stupid.\" Their other friend says they're being a jerk, but the author feels being next to someone in that outfit might reflect poorly on them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is concerned about how their friend's choice of clothing might affect their own image at the concert. They didn't like the Harley Quinn dress and told the friend she can't wear it. The friend wasn't familiar with the band and didn't do research, but the author had warned her about the band's style. The friend might have misinterpreted the advice as a suggestion to dress a certain way, but maybe the author's message wasn't clear.\n\nNow, considering social norms and personal boundaries. The author is paying for the tickets and the friend is accompanying them, so there might be an expectation of dressing appropriately. However, the friend isn't obligated to dress in a way that suits the author's preferences unless explicitly discussed. The author might have failed to communicate their expectations clearly. The friend's choice of attire is her own, and unless the event has a specific dress code, it's her right to wear what she wants. The author's concern about being associated with the friend's outfit seems a bit self-centered. Also, the friend might have felt that the author was being controlling by dictating her clothing choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be anxious about the event and wants to avoid any potential embarrassment. But that's their own anxiety to manage, not the responsibility of the friend's attire. The other friend's comment that the author is being a jerk makes sense because the friend isn't linked to the author's image unless they're in a group that requires a certain dress code. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is overstepping by dictating the friend's clothing choice. The friend's outfit is her own decision, and the author shouldn't impose their preferences unless there's a mutual agreement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
