I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the text is in the wrong. The situation is that she told her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author (24F) bought VIP tickets to see her favorite band. Her original friend bailed, so she asked another friend (30F) who was laid off and had time. The friend agreed. The band is a conceptual metal band with some campiness. The author told her friend about the VIP meet and greet part. The friend then sent a Harley Quinn dress from Hot Topic, which the author didn't like. The author is worried about being associated with that image since she's nervous about the event. Her friend said she was being a jerk, but the author feels it's important because they'll be standing together.\n\nHmm. So, is the author wrong? Well, the friend agreed to go, and the author didn't specify a dress code. The friend might not know the band well, but that's her choice. The author is allowed to feel self-conscious, but can she dictate her friend's attire? It's a personal choice. Unless there was a specific dress code, the author can't control what her friend wears. She might be projecting her own anxiety onto the situation. Also, the friend might feel disrespected if told she can't wear her chosen outfit. The author's friend's opinion is that she's being a jerk, which makes sense because the friend is allowed to wear whatever she wants unless it's against the event rules. The author's concern about association is valid, but she can't control that. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
