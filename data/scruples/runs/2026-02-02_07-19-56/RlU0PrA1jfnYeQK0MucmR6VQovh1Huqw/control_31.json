      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author (24F) bought VIP tickets to see her favorite band. She had a friend driving, but he bailed last minute. She then asked another friend (30F) to go with her because she was laid off and had time. The friend agreed. The author mentioned that part of the VIP package includes meeting the band, and the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't like because she finds it problematic and doesn't want to be associated with that image, especially since she's nervous about the event.\n\nThe other friend said the author was being a jerk, arguing that the friend's outfit shouldn't reflect on her. The author feels that being next to someone in a Harley Quinn dress might make her look bad, especially since the band isn't necessarily associated with that style.\n\nNow, why is this a dilemma? The key points are consent, autonomy, and social expectations. The author is essentially imposing her preferences on her friend's clothing choice. Even though they're friends, the friend might have her own reasons for choosing the dress. The author's concern about association is valid in a way, but it's also about personal expression. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend agreed to go along with the plan, but didn't specify her outfit. The author's request is a form of peer pressure. Unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event, the friend has the right to wear what she wants. The author might be using the \"I'm nervous\" excuse to control her friend's behavior, which isn't fair. The other friend's point is that others shouldn't judge based on someone else's attire. \n\nSo, the author is overstepping by telling her friend what to wear, even if it's out of concern. Unless there's a rule against it, it's her friend's choice. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
