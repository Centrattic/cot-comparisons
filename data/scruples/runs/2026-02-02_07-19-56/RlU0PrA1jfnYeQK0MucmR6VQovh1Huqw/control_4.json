I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author bought VIP tickets for her favorite band and had to bring a friend because her original friend bailed. The friend she brought is unemployed, so she's available. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band, which is a conceptual metal band with a campy style. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author dislikes, and the author is worried about being associated with that style since she's nervous about the event.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider a few angles. \n\n1. **Friendship and Boundaries**: The author asked the friend to come along, possibly implying some expectations without clear communication. The friend has the right to wear what she wants unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event. The author didn't mention a dress code before, so the friend might not have known it was an issue.\n\n2. **Judgment of Style**: The author's dislike of Harley Quinn and associating it with the band's campiness is subjective. It's possible the author is projecting her own preferences onto the situation. The friend might be expressing her personal style, which isn't inherently wrong.\n\n3. **Impact on the Author's Experience**: The author is concerned about being judged by others at the concert because of her friend's outfit. However, unless the dress code explicitly prohibits it, the author's discomfort might be her own issue to manage. The friend isn't obligated to change her style to accommodate the author's anxiety.\n\n4. **Friendship Advice**: The other friend said the author was being a jerk, pointing out that the friend's attire shouldn't reflect on her. This suggests that the author is overstepping by policing her friend's choices without a valid reason beyond her own preferences.\n\n5. **Event Details**: The band is conceptual metal with campiness, which might actually pair well with a Harley Quinn aesthetic. The author might have been overreacting, especially since the friend didn't know much about the band beforehand.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is overstepping by making her friend change her outfit based on her own preferences and anxiety. The friend has the right to wear what she wants unless there's a specific rule against it. The author's actions come off as controlling and judgmental, which isn't appropriate in a friendship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
