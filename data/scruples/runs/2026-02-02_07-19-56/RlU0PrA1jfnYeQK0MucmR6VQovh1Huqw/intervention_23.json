That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (24f) bought VIP tickets to a concert with a friend who bailed last minute. They had to bring another friend (30f) who wasn't familiar with the band. The author mentioned that part of the VIP package involves meeting the band, and the band is a conceptual metal group with a certain level of campiness. The friend then showed up with a Harley Quinn dress, which the author found inappropriate and wanted to tell her she couldn't wear it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author is concerned about being associated with the friend's choice of attire because they're at a VIP event. The friend's dress is inspired by Harley Quinn, a pop culture character, and the author is worried it might reflect poorly on them. The author's friend argues that the author is being a jerk because others won't associate the dress with them.\n\nSo, the key elements are: the author asked the friend to come at the last minute, the friend put in minimal effort to learn about the band, the author warned about the band's style, and the friend's choice of dress clashed with what the author expected. The author wants to enforce a dress code they didn't previously mention, just because they're nervous about being judged.\n\nI need to check if there's a breach of etiquette here. The author didn't set clear expectations about attire before the event. They only mentioned the band's style and the campiness, but perhaps that's different from a specific dress code. The friend might not have realized the importance of matching the band's aesthetic in their clothing. The author, in this case, might be overstepping by dictating what the friend can wear, especially since they asked them to come at short notice. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author paid for the tickets and the friend agreed to accompany them doesn't mean they have authority over the friend's clothing choices. Unless there was a prior agreement about attire, the author's reaction could be seen as being overly controlling. However, maybe the author has valid concerns about looking unprofessional or not fitting in with the VIP crowd. But since the friend wasn't aware of the band's style, maybe the author should have communicated better or not have made assumptions about the appropriate dress code.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have felt it's a personal choice of clothing and not something the author should dictate. The author's concern about being associated with the dress might be more about their own insecurities than the actual impact of the dress. The fact that the friend's other companion said the author was being a jerk supports that the author might be overreacting.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually have the right to dress how they like unless there's a specific dress code. The author didn't specify one, so the friend's choice isn't inherently wrong. The author's reaction could be seen as inconsiderate because they didn't set the expectations ahead of time. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for trying to control the friend's attire without prior communication.\n"
