I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The situation is that the author had to find a last-minute companion because her original friend bailed. The friend she asked hadn't heard of the band and didn't put effort into learning about them. The author mentioned the band is a conceptual metal group with campy songs, but the friend took that comment the wrong way. Then the friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't like because she's nervous about being associated with the band and looking stupid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's friend was laid off, so maybe she's looking for something fun. The author is worried about her image because she's meeting the band. The friend's choice of dress might not align with the band's style, which could make the author uncomfortable. The author's friend argues that the author is being a jerk, but the author is concerned about being seen with that outfit.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend agreed to go with the understanding of the VIP package. The author did mention the band's style, and the friend might have misunderstood. However, the author is now dictating the friend's clothing, which could be seen as overstepping. The friend has the right to wear what she wants unless there's a specific dress code. The author's reason is her own nervousness, but that doesn't necessarily give her the right to control another person's attire. The friend's choice of dress might be a personal expression, and the author's reaction could be more about her own insecurities than the friend's outfit. So the author might be in the wrong here because she's imposing her preferences without considering her friend's autonomy.\n"
