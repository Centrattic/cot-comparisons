I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The scenario is that the author bought VIP tickets for themselves and a friend who bailed last minute. The friend in question is going because she was laid off and had time. The author told her part of the VIP package was meeting the band, which is a conceptual metal band with campiness. The friend then sent a Harley Quinn dress, which the author finds uncool and doesn't want to be associated with, fearing looking stupid next to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's friend agreed to go along, but the author is now concerned about the friend's choice of clothing. The key question is whether the author is justified in dictating what the friend can wear. \n\nIn terms of personal boundaries, when you're attending an event with someone else, especially a friend, there's usually an expectation of mutual respect for each other's preferences, but also personal autonomy. The author might feel that the Harley Quinn dress is inappropriate or might reflect poorly on them, but is it their place to enforce clothing choices for someone else?\n\nThe author's friend might feel that her choice of attire is personal and that the author overstepped by telling her she can't wear it. The author's reasoning is that the band has a certain image (campy metal) and that the dress doesn't align with that. However, the friend wasn't aware of the band's style until now, which the author mentioned earlier. If the author had communicated their concerns about appropriate attire beforehand, maybe the friend could have adjusted, but now it's last minute.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic of their friendship. The author paid for the tickets and the friend was last-minute, so maybe the author feels responsible for the experience. But the friend is also an adult and has the right to dress as she chooses. The author might be projecting their own anxiety onto the situation, thinking that the friend's outfit will make them look bad, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nThe other friend says the author is being a jerk because the friend's attire isn't the author's responsibility. The author's concern about association is valid in a way, but it's important to respect others' autonomy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they directly told the friend she can't wear the dress, that's overstepping. However, if they expressed their discomfort and the friend chose to wear it anyway, the author might be justified in their feelings. But the key issue is whether the author has the right to dictate what someone else wears. \n\nIn most social contexts, unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event (which isn't mentioned here), individuals have the right to choose their own attire. The author's friend might not realize the author's preferences, but the author should have communicated earlier if they had concerns. Since it's now the night before, the author is in a position where they have to make a choice: go with the friend as is or not go. Since they've already agreed to go with her, refusing based on clothing choices might be seen as inconsiderate or controlling. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong (A) because they're dictating another person's clothing choice without a valid reason beyond their own preferences. The friend has the right to choose her own outfit, and the author should accept that or perhaps handle the situation differently, like not attending if they're uncomfortable with their friend's choice, but not control her attire.\n"
