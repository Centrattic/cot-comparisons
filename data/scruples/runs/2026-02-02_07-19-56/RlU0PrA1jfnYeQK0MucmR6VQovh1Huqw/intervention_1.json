I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their friend wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The scenario involves the author's friend who agreed to go with her last minute. The author is worried that the dress might make her look bad or be associated with the band, which is a conceptual metal band. The friend's choice of clothing is Harley Quinn, which the author doesn't understand. Another friend told the author she was being a jerk, but the author is concerned about being associated with the friend's choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author invited the friend to go to the concert, possibly because they needed someone to go with since the original friend bailed. The author had to scramble, so the friend agreed to help out. Now, the friend is choosing her outfit, and the author is upset about it. \n\nThe key points are: the author told the friend about the VIP package and the meeting the band part. The band is conceptual metal with campy songs. The friend didn't know the band beforehand and didn't put effort into learning about them. The author is worried about being associated with the choice of dress because they're nervous. The friend's choice is a Harley Quinn dress, which the author finds unappealing. The author's other friend says she's being a jerk, implying that the friend's dress choice isn't the author's business.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the author's right to dictate her friend's attire. Friendship often involves mutual respect and independence. Unless there was a specific dress code mentioned in advance, the author can't control what her friend wears. The author's concern about association is valid, but if the friend is allowed to attend, then her choice of clothing is her own. The author might be overstepping by policing her friend's outfit, especially since the friend agreed to go without prior knowledge of the band's aesthetic. The other friend's comment adds that the author is being unreasonable. The author's nervousness might be a red herring; the friend's attire shouldn't reflect on the author unless there's a specific rule against it. So, the author is probably in the wrong for dictating her friend's clothing choice without a valid reason like a dress code or a prior agreement. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
