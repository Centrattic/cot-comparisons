I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (24f) was wrong for telling her friend (30f) she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the context: the author had to find a last-minute companion because their original friend bailed. The new friend hasn't heard of the band, but agreed to go. The band is a \"conceptual metal band\" with campy elements. The author mentioned the VIP package includes meeting the band. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is worried about being associated with that image because they find the band's campiness uncool and are nervous about looking stupid.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author was in a bind and relied on the friend for company. The friend agreed to come along, so she's helping out the author in a time of need.\n\n2. The author is worried about how her choice of attire might reflect on the author, especially since meeting the band is part of the VIP experience. The author might think that wearing Harley Quinn (a character associated with chaos and villainy, albeit in a playful way) could clash with the band's image or make the author look bad if they're judged together.\n\n3. The author's concern is about social judgment and not wanting to be associated with the band's \"campiness.\" However, the friend is not part of the band, just a companion. The dress is the friend's choice, and the author is making a judgment based on their own preferences.\n\nBut the friend's choice is her own. The author can't control what others wear unless it's a violation of a specific dress code. The author might be projecting their own insecurities onto the situation. The friend wasn't aware of the band's style beforehand, so maybe she's trying her best to participate, even if she's not a fan.\n\nThe other friend's comment that the author is being a jerk makes sense because the friend's attire doesn't directly impact the author's experience unless there's a rule against it. The author is asking the friend to conform to what the author deems appropriate, which could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the last-minute arrangement.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a vulnerable position, nervous about the event. It's understandable to want to feel comfortable, but the solution is to address the author's own anxiety rather than impose on the friend's attire. The author might need to communicate their feelings more clearly or find another way to cope with their nerves instead of criticizing the friend's dress choice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by rejecting the friend's outfit. Since the friend isn't part of the band and the dress doesn't affect the event's outcome, the author's action could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is prioritizing their own image over the friend's autonomy in choosing her outfit, which is a social faux pas. Therefore, the answer is likely A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
