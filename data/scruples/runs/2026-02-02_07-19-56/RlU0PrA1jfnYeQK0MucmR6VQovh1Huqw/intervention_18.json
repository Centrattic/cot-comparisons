I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, 24f, bought VIP tickets for her favorite band. Her original friend bailed, so she asked another friend, 30f, who agreed. The friend didn't know the band, which is a conceptual metal band with campy songs. The author mentioned that the VIP package includes meeting the band, and she was nervous about being associated with the band's image. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author dislikes, thinking it might reflect poorly on the band or the event. The friend's other friend said the author was being a jerk, arguing that her dress choice doesn't affect the author. The author is worried about being associated with it because they'll be standing next to each other all night.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal choice, autonomy, and social dynamics. The author is trying to avoid looking like she supports or is associated with the Harley Quinn aesthetic, which she doesn't like. But the friend has the right to choose her own outfit, especially since she's not the one paying for the tickets or organizing the event. The author's main concern is social judgment based on proximity. However, in most cases, people are allowed to wear what they want unless there's a strict dress code or specific reason it's inappropriate for the event. The author's friend isn't violating any rules; she's just making a fashion choice. The author's anxiety about being associated with it seems to stem from her own discomfort rather than an actual rule or expectation. The other friend's response is valid because the author isn't responsible for her friend's choices, even if they're nearby. The author might be overstepping by trying to control someone else's attire, especially since it's a personal preference and not a violation of event policies. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she's imposing her personal taste on her friend without justification.\n"
