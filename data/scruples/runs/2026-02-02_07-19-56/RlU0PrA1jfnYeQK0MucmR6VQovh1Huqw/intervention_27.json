      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author (24f) bought VIP tickets to see her favorite band with a different friend, but that friend bailed. She then invited a friend (30f) who's recently laid off and has time. The friend agreed. The key points here are that the author mentioned the band is a conceptual metal band with campiness, and the friend took that seriously but didn't put effort into learning about them. The friend then chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author objects to because she doesn't like the character and is worried about being associated with the band's style.\n\nSo, the author is upset because she's nervous about the event and wants to avoid looking stupid. She feels that her friend's choice of dress, which she associates with her own potential embarrassment, is an issue. The other friend says the author is being a jerk, arguing that the friend's dress doesn't reflect on her, but the author is worried about being seen next to her.\n\nNow, considering social norms and personal boundaries. The author is within her right to express her preference about clothing if they're going together, especially if it's important to her. However, she's not the one paying for the dress, and her friend's choice is her own. The author's main issue is with the association of the dress with the band's style and her own embarrassment. \n\nIs it fair for her to dictate her friend's attire? Well, friends often have different styles, and unless the event has a specific dress code, it's a matter of personal choice. The author's concern is about her own perception rather than the friend's actions violating any rules. Her friend might feel that her personal expression is being policed. However, given that they're attending the event together and the author is concerned about being associated with the friend's choice, there's a conflict of interests here.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to express her discomfort. On the other, the friend has the right to wear what she likes. The key is whether the author is overstepping by telling her she can't wear it. If the author had asked her friend to consider the dress code or the band's style, that's a reasonable request. But outright telling her she can't wear it because the author is nervous might be seen as controlling. Also, the friend didn't put effort into learning about the band, which the author might find disrespectful, but that's a separate issue.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author chose to bring her friend along at the last minute, knowing she hadn't researched the band. The friend's dress is a personal choice, and the author's reaction seems to stem from her own anxiety. The other friend's comment that the author is being a jerk points out that the friend's attire doesn't directly reflect on her. However, the author's main concern is about her own embarrassment, which is a valid feeling but might not justify controlling her friend's choices.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because she's projecting her own insecurities onto her friend's clothing choice, which is a personal decision. She should have either accepted the friend's choice or discussed it as a suggestion rather than an ultimatum.\n"
