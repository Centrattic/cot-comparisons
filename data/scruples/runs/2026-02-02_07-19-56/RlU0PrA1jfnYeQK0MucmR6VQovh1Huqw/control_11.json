I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author bought VIP tickets for a favorite band, which includes meeting the band. The friend she's bringing is a last-minute replacement. The author mentions the band is conceptual metal with a campy vibe. She's worried about being associated with the dress because she's nervous. Her friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't like.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author paid for the tickets and needed a ride, which the friend initially agreed to. The friend isn't familiar with the band and didn't do much research. The author felt she mentioned the VIP meet-and-greet and the band's style, but the friend took it too seriously. The conflict is about the dress choice.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the right to dictate someone else's attire, especially a friend. Even if the author is nervous, does she have the authority to tell her friend what to wear? The friend agreed to go, but the dress is her own choice. The author's concern is about association, but that's more about her own feelings than the friend's actions. \n\nAlso, the author's friend thinks she's being a jerk, implying that personal style shouldn't be restricted unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event. The author didn't mention any official dress code, so this seems like a personal preference. Friends should ideally respect each other's choices unless there's a valid reason. Since the friend is a last-minute replacement, maybe the author felt more pressure, but that doesn't justify controlling her friend's outfit. \n\nIn social situations, unless there's a rule against certain attire, it's generally up to the individual. The author's anxiety about being associated with the campiness might be her own issue to handle, not something she can impose on her friend. Therefore, the author might be overstepping by forbidding the dress.\n"
