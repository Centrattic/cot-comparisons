I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (24f) bought VIP tickets to a concert with a different friend, but that friend bailed last minute. The author then invited another friend (30f) who was laid off and had time. She agreed to go.\n\nThe main issue is that the author told her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn inspired dress. The author is worried about looking stupid or being associated with the band since the band is a conceptual metal band with some campiness. The author's other friend says she's being a jerk, but the author feels that if they're standing next to each other all night, people might associate the friend's outfit with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a bind and had to ask a last-minute friend. The friend didn't know the band and didn't do much research. The author mentioned the VIP part includes meeting the band. The band is metal and campy, and the author's friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't understand as a choice. The author is nervous and wants to avoid being associated with the band's image.\n\nNow, is it wrong to tell a friend what to wear? Well, friends should have autonomy in their clothing choices unless there's a specific dress code. The author didn't mention that the concert had a strict dress code. The author's concern is about being associated with the band's style, but that's more about the author's personal feelings than any actual rule. The friend might have chosen the dress for her own reasons, not related to the band. The author's other friend thinks she's being a jerk, implying that the author shouldn't control her friend's outfit.\n\nHowever, the author is nervous and doesn't want to be embarrassed. But is it okay to impose personal preferences on a friend's clothing? In most cases, friends should have the freedom to dress how they want unless there's a specific reason (like a theme party). The author might be projecting their own anxiety onto the situation. The friend isn't responsible for the author's nerves. The author could have communicated their concerns and maybe suggested different options, but outright telling the friend she can't wear the dress is crossing a boundary. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
