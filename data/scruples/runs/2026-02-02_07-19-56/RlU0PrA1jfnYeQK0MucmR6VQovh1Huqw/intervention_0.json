I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend who was laid off and then agreed to go to a concert with her. The author is nervous about the event and didn't want to be associated with the band's campy image, so when the friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, the author felt uncomfortable and didn't want to be seen with that outfit. The friend's other person said the author was being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author invited a friend at the last minute because their original plan fell through. The friend was laid off and had time. The author mentioned the band's style, including their campiness. The friend chose an outfit that the author finds inappropriate, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The author is responsible for inviting a friend who might not be familiar with the band's style. They did mention the band's campiness, but maybe didn't set clear expectations about the dress code. However, the friend made a choice based on her own interpretation. The author is now upset about the outfit, but does that make them the asshole?\n\nThe author is worried about being associated with the band's image, but if the friend is their companion, does the author have a right to dictate her clothing? Generally, people can choose their own outfits unless there's a specific dress code enforced by the event. Since the VIP package didn't mention a dress code, the author's objection is more about their own preferences rather than any rule.\n\nAdditionally, the author is nervous, which is understandable, but projecting that anxiety onto the friend by disapproving of her dress choice might be unfair. The friend's choice of a Harley Quinn dress is a personal expression and doesn't inherently reflect on the band unless the author feels the image is misaligned. However, the author's primary responsibility is to communicate their expectations clearly. If they didn't specify a dress code, they can't necessarily expect the friend to follow unspoken rules.\n\nBut the author did mention the band's campiness, so maybe the friend took that into account. If the friend misunderstood and chose an outfit that's in line with the band's aesthetic (since Harley Quinn is a pop culture figure with a campy vibe), the author's concern is misplaced. Alternatively, if the band's style is different from Harley Quinn, then the author's discomfort is valid, but it's more about their own nervousness than the friend's choice.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting personal choices is important. The author is upset about being associated with the friend's outfit, but that's more about their own social anxiety than the friend's right to wear what she wants. The author should have either communicated a clear dress code or accepted that their companion might choose something that doesn't align with their preferences. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being judgmental without setting clear expectations beforehand.\n"
