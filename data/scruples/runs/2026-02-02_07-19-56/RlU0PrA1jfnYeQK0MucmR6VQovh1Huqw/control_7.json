That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (24f) bought VIP tickets to see their favorite band but had to bring a friend (30f) after their original companion bailed. The friend in question hasn't heard of the band, didn't put effort into learning about them, and chose a Harley Quinn dress. The author is worried that the dress might make them look bad since the band is a \"conceptual metal band\" with campy songs. The author's friend thinks they're being a jerk, but the author is concerned about being associated with the friend's choice.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author's main concern is about being associated with the friend's clothing choice, which they perceive as not aligning with the band's style. They're worried about looking stupid or being embarrassed because the friend's attire might clash with the band's concept.\n\n2. The friend's choice of a Harley Quinn dress is based on her own preference, not necessarily related to the band. The author hasn't explicitly stated that the band has a specific dress code or that the VIP package requires certain attire. They mentioned the band's conceptual nature and campiness, but the friend's dress isn't about the band\u2014it's a character from a different context (Harley Quinn from DC Comics).\n\n3. The author is allowing personal anxiety about being judged to influence their judgment of the friend's choice. The friend's attire is her own expression, and unless there's a clear rule against it (which there isn't in the scenario), the author's concern seems misplaced.\n\n4. The other friend's advice that the author is being a jerk suggests that the author is overstepping by policing the friend's outfit. The friend has the right to wear what she wants unless there's a specific reason not to, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, the author is acting out of their own insecurity and possibly projecting their worries onto the situation. The friend isn't doing anything wrong by choosing her own outfit, especially since there's no indication the band or the event has a strict dress code. The author's reaction is more about their own anxiety than the friend's actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for trying to dictate the friend's clothing choice based on their own concerns rather than respecting the friend's autonomy and preferences.\n"
