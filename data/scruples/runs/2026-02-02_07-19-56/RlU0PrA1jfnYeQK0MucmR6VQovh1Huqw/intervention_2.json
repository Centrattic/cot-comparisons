I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the author bought VIP tickets for their favorite band, had to bring a friend after another friend canceled. The friend in question (30f) agreed to go, but she hadn't listened to the band before. The author mentioned that part of the VIP package includes meeting the band, who are a conceptual metal band with campy songs. The friend then chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author finds uncool and wants to avoid looking stupid or being associated with her choice.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is worried about their image and association with the friend's outfit. The friend might not have realized the band's style, but she agreed to go. The author is nervous and wants to avoid looking bad. But is it their place to control what someone else wears? The author's friend argued the author was being a jerk, saying others' choices aren't the author's responsibility. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they'll be standing next to the friend all night, so they don't want to be associated with her choice. But friends should respect each other's choices unless there's a specific reason. The author didn't mention the band's specific dress code, just that it's a conceptual metal band. Maybe the Harley Quinn image is too pop culture, but that's subjective. The author's main issue is their own anxiety about looking bad. \n\nI think the author overstepped. Friends should be able to make their own fashion choices unless the event has a strict dress code. The author's reaction is based on personal discomfort rather than the friend violating any rules. Telling someone they can't wear what they want is controlling. The friend's choice isn't harmful to the author. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
