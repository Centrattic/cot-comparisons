I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the user (24f) bought VIP tickets to see her favorite band with a friend. Another friend who was supposed to drive bailed last minute, so she had to ask another friend (30f) who was laid off and had time. The friend agreed. The user mentioned that part of the VIP package includes meeting the band, and the band is a conceptual metal group with campy songs. The friend didn't know the band and didn't put effort into learning about them. The user thought the friend might take it too seriously, which she did. Now, the friend sent a Harley Quinn dress from Hot Topic, and the user is worried about looking stupid or being associated with the dress. Another friend said she was a jerk, but the user feels that being next to someone in that dress all night would make her look bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations here. The user invited her friend to go with her, so the friend's choice of attire isn't something the user is directly responsible for. The user might feel that the dress is inappropriate for the event, especially since the band is a conceptual metal group. However, the friend wasn't informed about the dress not being appropriate beforehand. The user didn't specify clothing guidelines, so the friend might not have known.\n\nThe user is worried about being associated with the band's image if she's seen next to someone in a Harley Quinn dress. But is that a valid concern? It depends on how the band is perceived. If the band is indeed conceptual with campy elements, maybe Harley Quinn's style aligns with that. However, the user might not like the character, so she's concerned about the association. But the friend isn't part of the band; she's just a fan of the dress. The user's friend argues that the friend's choice shouldn't affect the user's reputation. \n\nAlso, the user paid for the tickets and needed a last-minute companion, so she might not have had the time to set strict dress code rules. The friend's lack of knowledge about the band isn't her fault, and she's still attending the event. The user's main issue is about appearance and potential embarrassment. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the user didn't specify a dress code, the friend isn't at fault for choosing her outfit based on her own preferences. The user might feel uncomfortable, but it's her own anxiety about the event that's causing the issue. The user is projecting her own insecurities onto the friend's choice. \n\nSo, the user is overstepping by judging her friend's outfit choice without prior communication. The friend isn't violating any rules by wearing the dress, and the user's reaction seems more about her own nerves than the actual appropriateness of the dress. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for trying to control her friend's attire without discussing it beforehand.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A  \nThe author is in the wrong. The friend wasn't informed about a dress code, and the choice of outfit doesn't inherently reflect on the band or the author's credibility. The author's concern stems from personal insecurities rather than the friend's attire being objectively inappropriate. Judging someone's clothing choice without prior discussion is overstepping, especially when the friend agreed to accompany the author last-minute.",
