I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The situation is that the author bought VIP tickets to a metal band's concert with a different friend who bailed, so she brought another friend who's laid off and has time. The key points here are the author's reasoning for objecting to the dress.\n\nFirst, the author mentions the band is conceptual metal with campy elements, and she told her friend that part of the VIP package includes meeting the band. The friend then chose a Harley Quinn dress. The author finds Harley Quinn unappealing and is worried about being associated with that image, especially since she's nervous about the event. \n\nThe author's main concern is about not wanting to be associated with the Harley Quinn character because of the band's style. But the friend's choice of clothing is her own. The author is making a judgment about the friend's attire based on her own preferences and the context of the event. However, the friend isn't part of the band or the event's theme. The VIP package is about meeting the band, but the friend's outfit doesn't relate to that. \n\nThe other friend said the author is being a jerk because the friend's clothing choice isn't the author's responsibility. The author's argument is that being next to someone in that outfit might reflect poorly on her. But is that valid? The friend is a separate person with her own rights to choose her outfit. The author can't control others' clothing choices unless it's a specific dress code set by the event, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nThe author is being judgmental and imposing her own preferences on her friend. The friend wasn't told about the band's style in a way that would make the Harley Quinn dress inappropriate. The author's nervousness might be causing her to project her insecurities onto her friend's attire. \n\nSo, the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because she's overstepping by dictating her friend's clothing choice based on her own discomfort and assumptions about the band's style, without any actual rules from the event itself.\n"
