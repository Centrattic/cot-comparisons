That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought VIP tickets to see their favorite band. Their original friend bailed last minute, so they asked a friend (who's unemployed right now) to go with them. The friend agreed. The author mentioned that the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs, and part of the VIP package includes meeting the band. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is upset because they don't like Harley Quinn and don't want to be associated with that image, especially since they're nervous about the event.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author paid for the tickets and had to find a last-minute companion. They might be concerned about their own comfort and the impression they make, especially since they're meeting the band. They might feel the Harley Quinn dress is too edgy or doesn't fit the band's vibe, which is campy but maybe not as edgy as Quinn. Plus, being next to someone in that costume all night could make the author feel self-conscious.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was laid off and had time to do this. She might have thought the dress was appropriate or just wanted to have fun. The author's friend said they were a jerk for objecting, arguing that the friend's clothes don't reflect on the author. The author is worried about being associated with it, but if the band isn't Harley Quinn-related, maybe that's a valid concern. However, personal choices about clothing are usually up to the individual. The author is imposing their own preferences on someone else, which could be seen as controlling or disrespectful.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they're nervous and don't want to look stupid. The friend might not share the same concerns. The key here is whether the author has the right to dictate what someone else wears, especially in a public setting where they're just attending a concert together.\n\nI think the author might be overstepping. The friend's choice of dress is her own, and unless the band's theme explicitly forbids such attire (which the author didn't mention), the author shouldn't have a say. The author's nervousness is their own issue, but it's not the friend's responsibility to accommodate that by changing her outfit. So the author is in the wrong for trying to control their friend's clothing choice.\n"
