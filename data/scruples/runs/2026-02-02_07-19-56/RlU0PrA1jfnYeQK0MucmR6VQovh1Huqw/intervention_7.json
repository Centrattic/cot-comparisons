I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn-inspired dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought VIP tickets to see her favorite band. Her driver backed out, so she asked a friend who was laid off (so has time) to go with her. The friend agreed. The band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs. The author told her friend about meeting the band and the band's style. The friend sent a Harley Quinn dress pic. The author is worried about being associated with the dress because she's nervous and doesn't want to look stupid. Her other friend says she's being a jerk, but she feels it's linked to her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. \n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Friendship Boundaries**: The author invited the friend to accompany her, which is a favor. The friend accepted. The author might feel responsible for the friend's appearance since they'll be together. However, clothing choices are personal unless there's a dress code specified. The author didn't mention any restrictions on attire, so the friend's choice is her own. \n\n2. **Association Concerns**: The author is worried that the friend's costume might reflect poorly on her, especially since it's a VIP event. But unless the concert has a specific dress code (which the author didn't enforce beforehand), the friend's choice isn't the author's to control. The author's nervousness about being judged isn't a valid reason to dictate another person's outfit.\n\n3. **Friend's Perspective**: The friend might feel disrespected if the author is criticizing her choice. The author's friend pointed out the author was being a jerk, which suggests social norms might support the other friend's viewpoint. The author's concern about looking stupid by association is about her own insecurities, not the friend's actions.\n\n4. **Responsibility for Friend's Actions**: Once the author has extended the invitation and the friend has accepted, the friend is responsible for her own choices. The author can't control others' perceptions unless there's a prior agreement on attire. The author should handle her own anxiety without imposing on her friend's autonomy.\n\n5. **Alternative Solutions**: The author could have communicated any dress code expectations beforehand. Since she didn't, she's now facing a situation where she's trying to retract the invitation based on her friend's choice. This could be seen as unfair to the friend who made a choice in good faith.\n\nPutting it all together, the author is overstepping by dictating her friend's outfit without prior discussion. The friend isn't obligated to change her attire unless there were specific conditions set. The author's actions could damage the friendship by making the friend feel judged. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
