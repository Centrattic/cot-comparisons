I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The situation involves the author needing a last-minute plus one, and the friend choosing an outfit that the author doesn't like.\n\nFirst, the author bought VIP tickets with another friend who bailed. She then asked a newly unemployed friend to accompany her. The key points here are the author's reasons for the objection. She mentions that the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs, and she's worried about being associated with that image. She took issue with the Harley Quinn dress because she doesn't understand the appeal and is nervous about looking stupid.\n\nNow, the friend's choice of clothing is her own. The author is essentially criticizing her friend's fashion choice based on personal taste and a desire to avoid perceived embarrassment. The friend's outfit doesn't directly affect the author's experience at the concert unless the author is uncomfortable standing next to someone in a style she dislikes. However, the author's friend might feel that the author is being judgmental or controlling.\n\nThe other friend said the author was a jerk, pointing out that the friend's clothing choice isn't the author's responsibility. The author's argument is that proximity might lead to association, but this seems a bit self-centered. It's her own choice to be at the event, and she's imposing her standards on her friend without considering the friend's autonomy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally have the right to dress how they want unless there's a specific dress code. The author didn't mention any such code, so the friend's choice is personal. The author's anxiety about being associated with the band's style is her own issue, not something that justifies controlling her friend's attire.\n\nSo, the author is overstepping by dictating her friend's clothing based on her own discomfort and preferences. The friend's decision to wear the dress is her own, and the author's reaction is more about her own insecurities than the friend's actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
