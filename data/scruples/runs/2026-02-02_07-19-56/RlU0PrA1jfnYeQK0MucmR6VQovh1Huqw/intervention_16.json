I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The situation is that the author had to scramble to find a last-minute companion after their original plan fell through. The friend agreed to go with them, and the author expressed that the band is a conceptual metal band with some campiness. The friend then chose a Harley Quinn dress, and the author is upset about it because they don't want to look stupid or be associated with the band in a negative way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author is worried about their image, especially since the VIP package includes meeting the band. They might be anxious about being seen with someone who doesn't seem to understand or appreciate the band's style. However, the friend didn't put effort into learning about the band, but she did agree to go, and the author invited her in a pinch.\n\nThe friend's choice of dress is a red flag for the author. The key issue here is whether the author has the right to dictate what their friend wears. Friendship is about mutual respect, and telling someone they can't wear something they chose might be overstepping. The author's friend might feel that her personal style is a reflection of her own choices, not necessarily the band's. The author's concern about association is valid in a way\u2014they might be worried about how others perceive them\u2014but that doesn't give them the right to control another's attire.\n\nAlso, the author's friend might not care about the band's style and is just attending as a companion. The author's anxiety about looking stupid could be personal and shouldn't place the responsibility on the friend. The other friend's advice that the author is being a jerk makes sense because the friend's outfit choice isn't the author's responsibility. The author might need to work on their own insecurities rather than projecting them onto others.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is being inconsiderate by trying to control their friend's clothing choice. It's more about their own nerves than the friend's actions. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
