I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert.\n\nFirst, the author's friend agreed to go with her after the original driver bailed. The author mentioned that the VIP package includes meeting the band, and the band is a conceptual metal group with some campiness. The friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author doesn't like and is worried about being associated with.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author is concerned about her image and not wanting to look stupid. She's nervous and wants to avoid embarrassment. Her friend, who didn't know much about the band, might not have realized the dress would be problematic. The other friend said the author was being a jerk, arguing that what the friend wears isn't the author's responsibility.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The author paid for the tickets and chose the friend to go with, so she might feel responsible for the group's image. However, the friend's choice of attire is her own, and the author has no control over that unless specified. The author's reason is based on her own discomfort and fear of association, which might not be a valid reason to dictate someone else's clothing. The friend might not have known the dress was inappropriate, so the author could have communicated her concerns earlier or suggested alternatives without outright forbidding the dress. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a stressful situation and might feel justified in wanting to avoid embarrassment. But generally, unless there are specific event dress codes (which there aren't mentioned here), the friend's choice is her own. The author's reaction seems more about her own anxiety than the friend's actions being objectively wrong.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because she's imposing her standards on her friend without considering her friend's autonomy and without a legitimate reason. The other friend's point that it's not the author's responsibility holds weight. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
