I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. \n\nFirst, the context: The author bought VIP tickets for a concert with a different friend who bailed last minute. They found another friend (who was laid off and available) to go with them. The key points are that the author is nervous about the event, mentioned that the band is a conceptual metal group with campy songs, and the friend didn't know much about them. The author then expressed discomfort with the friend wearing a Harley Quinn dress, associating it with being too campy or maybe not fitting the vibe.\n\nThe friend's choice of attire is from Hot Topic, and the author is worried about being associated with it since they want to avoid looking stupid. The other friend says the author is being a jerk because the dress won't be associated with them.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally or ethically, can the author control what someone else wears? The author isn't the one organizing the event, just attending with a friend. The dress isn't against any rules of the concert. The author's main issue is personal discomfort and fear of being associated with the style, which is more about their own feelings rather than anything objective.\n\nThe author might have a right to feel uncomfortable, but telling a friend they can't wear something is controlling. Friendship should allow for personal expression unless there's a specific reason (like event dress code). The author's argument that proximity makes the dress reflect on them is a bit flawed since people dress however they want, and the author can't dictate that unless it's a formal arrangement.\n\nSo the author is being overly controlling. The correct answer would be A, they're in the wrong. Wait, but the user wants B if they're not in the wrong. Wait, the options are A for Yes (author is wrong), B for No. So based on that, the answer is A.\n"
