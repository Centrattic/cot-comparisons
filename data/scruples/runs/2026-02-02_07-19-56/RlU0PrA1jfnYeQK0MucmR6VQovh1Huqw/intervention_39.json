I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend not to wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The author bought VIP tickets with a friend who bailed last minute, so they asked another friend (who was recently laid off) to go instead. The author mentioned the band is a \"conceptual metal band\" with campy elements, and they were worried about being associated with that image. When the friend sent a Harley Quinn dress, the author felt it would make them look bad because the band isn't that kind of vibe.\n\nFirst, the author's main reason is about not wanting to be associated with the band's image. But the friend wasn't against the band's style; she just had a different fashion choice. The author is using the band's \"campy\" aspect as a reason to police the friend's outfit. The other friend thought the author was being a jerk, saying the friend's outfit shouldn't reflect on them. The author is concerned about being seen next to someone in a Harley Quinn dress, implying that the band isn't into that aesthetic.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to control how their friend dresses? The friend agreed to go, so the author's main issue is about their own image. However, the friend is allowed to wear what she wants unless there's a specific dress code. The author didn't check if there were any restrictions. The author also mentions the friend didn't know much about the band, but that's not the friend's fault. The author's reaction seems to be about their own insecurities or desire to fit in. The friend's choice of dress is her own, and the author can't control that. The author might be projecting their own nerves onto the situation rather than respecting the friend's autonomy in choosing her outfit. So, the author is probably in the wrong because they're making a personal request about appearance without a valid reason related to the event itself. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
