I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me. But if I\u2019m standing next to her all night i feel like it will! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author bought VIP tickets to see her favorite band with a different friend who bailed last minute. She then asked her laid-off friend to go with her. The friend agreed but didn't know much about the band. The author mentioned that part of the VIP package includes meeting the band, and that the band is a conceptual metal group with campy songs. The friend, thinking seriously, chose a Harley Quinn dress. The author is upset because she's worried about being associated with the dress, which she doesn't like, since she's nervous about the event. Her other friend said she was being a jerk, but she's concerned about looking stupid next to her.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is being judgmental about her friend's choice of clothing based on her own preferences and her anxiety about the event. The friend made her own choice of dress, not knowing the band well. The author's reasoning is that the dress is associated with a character (Harley Quinn) she doesn't like, and she's worried about being seen with that image. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend is allowed to wear what she wants unless there's a specific dress code. The author had a chance to mention any concerns beforehand but didn't. The friend's choice isn't related to the band's style, but the author is projecting her dislike of Harley Quinn onto the event. She's also being judgmental about her friend's fashion choice, which isn't the friend's fault. The author's anxiety might be making her overreact, and she's not considering that her friend has the right to express herself. The other friend's comment that it's not associated with the author makes sense; unless the dress is inappropriate for the event itself, which the author hasn't specified. Since the author didn't set any boundaries about clothing, she's overstepping by telling her friend what to wear. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being controlling and judgmental without valid reasons.\n"
