I paid for the tickets if he drove. The show is four hours away.\n\nHe bailed last min so I had to scramble to find someone to go with me. Recently my friend was laid off so i knew she would have the time. She (30f) agreed.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That\u2019s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.\n\nTonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don\u2019t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don\u2019t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.\n\nMy other friend said i was being a jerk. That whatever she wore won\u2019t be associated with me.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling a friend she can't wear a Harley Quinn dress to a concert. The scenario is that the author had VIP tickets to a band they really like, paid for them with a friend who bailed last minute. They found another friend (who got laid off and has time) to go with. The problem is the friend chose a Harley Quinn dress, which the author thinks is inappropriate because the band is a conceptual metal band with campy songs. The author is worried about being associated with the band's image and looking stupid.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about personal clothing choices. The author's friend is wearing a costume-inspired dress, which might not align with the author's preferences. The author is concerned about being seen next to someone in such an outfit, possibly affecting their own judgment or the perception of their taste. But is it the author's right to dictate what their friend wears?\n\nIn terms of social norms, unless there's a specific dress code set by the event, people generally have the freedom to choose their outfits. The author didn't mention the event having a strict dress code. The VIP access includes meeting the band, but that doesn't necessarily mean the audience has to dress in any particular way. The author's friend's choice might clash with the band's concept, but the band's performance is likely the main focus, not the audience's attire.\n\nThe author's friend agreed to go with them, possibly because they needed a last-minute companion. The author might have expected the friend to dress in a certain way to align with the band's theme, but that's an assumption. The friend's choice of a Harley Quinn dress could be purely personal and unrelated to the band. The author's discomfort stems from their own anxiety about being associated with the band's image, which is a personal issue rather than something the friend is objectively doing wrong.\n\nThe other friend says the author is being a jerk, pointing out that the friend's clothing choice isn't the author's responsibility. The author is projecting their own insecurities onto the situation. Even if they're worried about being judged, it's not their place to control what their friend wears. The friendship might have boundaries, but this seems like a minor issue that could be resolved with communication rather than a demand to change attire.\n\nSo, the author is imposing their personal preferences on their friend's choice without a valid reason. Unless there's a specific rule about the dress code, the friend has the right to wear what she likes. The author's reaction is more about their own anxiety than the friend's actual choice. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for dictating the friend's clothing based on their own insecurities.\n"
