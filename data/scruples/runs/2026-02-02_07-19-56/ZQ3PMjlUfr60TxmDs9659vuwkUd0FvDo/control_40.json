He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The question is from a moral standpoint, not legal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author received a lot of unsolicited explicit photos. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders by threatening to share them unless money is sent. They admit they're not interested in legal advice but want to know if it's morally wrong.\n\nSo, morally, is it okay to retaliate in this way? Well, blackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves threatening to expose something to get money or another favor. Even if the person being blackmailed did something wrong (like sending unsolicited pics), using that as leverage to extort them isn't morally justified. \n\nThen there's the concept of justice versus revenge. The author might feel wronged and want to teach a lesson, but blackmail is more about gaining something for oneself rather than just making the sender understand the consequences of their actions. Retaliation like this could be seen as taking the law into one's own hands, which can escalate the situation and cause more harm than good.\n\nAlso, consider the harm caused. The senders of the unsolicited pics might face public humiliation if the photos are shared, which can have serious personal and professional repercussions. Even if the author feels they have a right to the photos since they were sent, using them for blackmail isn't a proportionate response. The senders' actions, while inconsiderate and possibly violating personal boundaries, don't justify the author engaging in similar unethical behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of \"do unto others...\" If the author would be upset if they were in the sender's position, then this action would be hypocritical. It's about empathy and understanding the other person's perspective. \n\nAdditionally, there's the question of consent. The photos were sent without the author's consent, but using them for blackmail also lacks the sender's consent. It's a cycle of non-consensual actions, which morally isn't right.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author has the right to use the photos as a form of retribution. But morally, retaliation doesn't resolve the issue constructively. It's a cycle of harm. The better approach would be to block the senders, report if necessary, or use the experience to set boundaries without engaging in harmful actions oneself.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though the senders acted inconsiderately, the author's plan to blackmail them crosses a moral line. The ends don't justify the means, and it's a form of unethical behavior regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n"
