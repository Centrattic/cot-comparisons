He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this post is in the wrong when considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking for legal advice but a moral judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has received many unsolicited explicit images from strangers and acquaintances. They're considering blackmailing those individuals by threatening to share the images unless money is paid. They mention organizing a \"phallus gallery,\" which suggests they might have a collection of these images already. They also say they're a struggling college student, which might be a reason they want to make money this way.\n\nNow, the moral aspect. The key points here are consent, harm, and the principle of treating others as you would want to be treated. The people who sent the images did so without the author's consent, which is already a violation. But does that justify the author retaliating in the same harmful way?\n\nOn one hand, the author is responding to a violation by committing a similar violation. Blackmail is a form of coercion and can cause significant distress. Even if the author has a right to be upset, using blackmail as a response perpetuates a cycle of harm. It's not about legalities but ethics. Morally, is it right to hurt others, even if they first acted inappropriately?\n\nAlso, the author is considering using these images for financial gain. That's exploiting others' mistakes, which might be seen as taking advantage of someone's vulnerability. Even if the people sent the images voluntarily, the author is now using that to their advantage in a way that's harmful. It's similar to the concept of \"an eye for an eye,\" but that often leads to more conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author might feel that this is a justified retaliation or a way to teach others a lesson. However, the ends don't necessarily justify the means morally. The harm caused by blackmail can be severe for the victims, leading to embarrassment, anxiety, or even financial loss. Even if some of the senders are strangers, blackmail is a serious ethical breach.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that \"they shouldn't have sent the pics\" might not absolve them of wrongdoing. Just because someone else made a mistake doesn't mean you can respond with a similar unethical action. It's about maintaining one's own ethical standards regardless of others' actions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is planning to retaliate in a harmful way against people who wronged them. Ethically, this seems to cross a line. The harm caused by blackmail is significant and not justified, even as a form of revenge. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
