He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking about legal stuff but moral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos from both strangers and people they know. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders for money. They mention that they technically own the photos since the others sent them, so they're not worried about legal aspects.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is this okay? Well, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it's coercing someone into giving money or favors by threatening to expose something. Even if the photos were sent unsolicited, using them to blackmail someone is exploiting the situation for personal gain. The senders might have made a mistake or acted inappropriately, but the author's retaliation could cause harm to the senders, potentially affecting their personal or professional lives. \n\nAlso, the author is a struggling college student, which might explain the motivation, but that doesn't justify unethical actions. Morally, it's about fairness and justice. While the senders were in the wrong for sending unsolicited content, the author's response could be seen as taking revenge beyond the initial wrongdoing. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the author feels wronged, blackmail isn't a morally acceptable response because it's another form of exploitation.\n\nMoreover, the author is comparing themselves to the situation where someone else was blackmailed. They find humor in that person's plight, but if they do the same, they become the antagonist. Morality often looks at intentions and the broader impact. The author's plan would perpetuate a cycle of harm and might not address the underlying issue of why people send unsolicited content. It's a form of vigilantism that could lead to more negative consequences than positive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. Their actions, while perhaps understandable in frustration, are morally wrong because they're using unethical means to correct a problem that, while annoying, doesn't justify blackmail.\n"
