He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this post is in the wrong. The scenario is about blackmailing people who send unsolicited dick pics. The author is considering doing this for revenge or as a joke, not legally, but morally.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos. They are considering blackmailing those people by threatening to share the photos unless they pay money. They mention they're not asking for legal advice, just moral. \n\nSo the key points here are: the act of blackmail, the initial act of sending unsolicited images, and the moral implications. \n\nBlackmail is inherently unethical because it's using threats to extort money or favors. Even though the recipients of the photos sent them without consent, the author is now using that against them. \n\nMoral standpoint usually considers intentions, harm, and justice. The author's intention here is revenge or punishment for the inconvenience of receiving unwanted images. But is that justification enough? \n\nUnsolicited explicit photos are creepy and violate the sender's privacy, but the author taking those photos and threatening to share them is also a violation of the sender's privacy and autonomy. It's a form of retaliation that could cause significant harm, like embarrassment or emotional distress. \n\nEven if the author believes they have a right to the photos because they were sent to them, using them to blackmail someone isn't morally acceptable. It becomes a cycle of harm. \n\nAlso, the author mentions it's for \"fun\" or to make others think twice. That's not a valid moral justification. Revenge doesn't make the action right, regardless of the initial wrongdoing. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's plan is to retaliate in a harmful way based on the other person's mistake. Morally, that's considered wrong because it perpetuates harm and doesn't address the root issue. The right approach would be to block those people and not engage in harmful behavior oneself. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
