He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The author mentions they've received many such photos over the years and wants to take advantage by blackmailing them, not from a legal but moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the morality here. The key points are the unsolicited nature of the photos and the author's intent to retaliate by blackmailing. The author believes they own the photos since they were sent by the senders. But morally, is it okay to blackmail someone, even if they've done something wrong?\n\nUnsolicited explicit images are generally considered a violation of privacy and boundaries. The senders are at fault for sending them without consent. However, the author's response is to use blackmail, which is coercive and harmful. Even if the senders made a mistake, retaliating with blackmail could cause significant harm, like public humiliation or financial loss. \n\nMoral philosophy often emphasizes proportionality in responses. While the senders acted inappropriately, the author's retaliation could be seen as excessive. It's about balancing justice and mercy. The author might feel wronged, but using blackmail turns the situation into a cycle of harm. Additionally, the author's intent to profit from the situation, even as a struggling student, adds a layer of exploitation.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The senders might not have intended for this to happen, and the author's threat could have severe consequences. Even if the photos were sent voluntarily, the context matters. The senders might not have considered the potential for blackmail, making the author's actions more manipulative.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, while the senders are clearly at fault for the initial violation, the author's plan for blackmail crosses into unethical territory. It's about the response being morally wrong despite the initial wrongdoing. The author is using the harm done to them to cause further harm, which is typically not condoned in moral systems that advocate for forgiveness or proportional justice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
