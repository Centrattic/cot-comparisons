He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The user isn't asking about legal repercussions but moral ones.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has received a lot of unsolicited explicit photos from strangers and people they know. They're thinking about using these photos to blackmail the senders, similar to the friend's situation in the legal post they read. They mention that they own the photos since the senders sent them, but they want moral advice.\n\nMoral standpoint. So, from a moral perspective, is it right to retaliate in this way? Well, unsolicited explicit photos are a violation of privacy. The senders are the ones at fault for sending such content without consent. The author is considering using that against them, which is a form of revenge. But does that make the author the wrongdoer?\n\nBlackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves threatening to expose someone's secrets unless they comply with demands. Even if the person is at fault for sending the photos, using that information to harm them is a form of unethical retaliation. The author might feel wronged, but taking matters into one's own hands by blackmailing is not a morally acceptable response. It perpetuates a cycle of harm and can cause further distress to the victims. Instead, reporting the behavior or blocking the individuals would be more appropriate actions. So, from a moral standpoint, the author is in the wrong because they are engaging in an unethical act of blackmail, even if the senders were wrong to send the photos. The harm caused by blackmailing far outweighs the initial wrongdoing.\n"
