He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't concerned with legal repercussions but is focused on the moral aspect.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has received many unsolicited explicit images over the years. They\u2019re thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders by threatening to share them unless money is sent. They mention they\u2019re a struggling college student, so maybe they\u2019re thinking of using this as a way to make money.\n\nNow, the moral question. From a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves coercion and exploiting someone's vulnerability. Even if the photos were sent without the author's consent, using them to extort money would be a form of revenge or punishment. But is that justified?\n\nThe senders did act inappropriately by sending unsolicited explicit photos, which is disrespectful and violates boundaries. However, the author's response is to take matters into their own hands with blackmail. While the senders are at fault for initiating the situation, the author's proposed action is a harmful and unethical response. Instead of addressing the issue through proper channels (like blocking the individuals or reporting them), the author wants to retaliate in a way that causes harm, which is morally questionable.\n\nMoral principles often emphasize proportionality and the intention behind actions. Even if the senders were wrong, the author's retaliation is a form of vigilante justice that can lead to further harm. Blackmail is a criminal act morally, as it undermines trust and can lead to more suffering. The author is using the victims' mistakes against them for personal gain, which isn't justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because blackmail is an unethical and harmful response, regardless of the initial wrongdoing by the senders. The right approach would be to ignore or block such messages rather than engage in extortion.\n"
