He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who received unsolicited dick pics and is considering blackmailing the senders for revenge. The original poster (OP) is asking if they would be the asshole (WIBTA) if they did that, and the user is seeking an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The OP is planning to blackmail people who sent them unwanted explicit photos. They mention they're not asking for legal advice but moral. The key points here are consent, privacy, and the ethical implications of retaliation.\n\nThe unsolicited nature of the photos is a problem. The senders are the ones who violated the OP's privacy by sending explicit content without permission. However, the OP's response is to threaten to expose those photos in exchange for money. That's blackmail. Even though the OP technically has copies, using them for blackmail is a moral issue because it's coercing someone into giving money under threat.\n\nMoral standpoint: Is it justified? The OP is being victimized by the initial act, but their response is another form of harm. Some might argue that the senders deserved it because they sent the photos, but blackmail is generally considered unethical. It's a cycle of harm. Even if the initial act was wrong, retaliating with blackmail perpetuates the problem. Additionally, it could lead to more harm for the senders, potentially ruining their lives if the photos are exposed.\n\nAlso, the OP is in a position to exploit someone else's mistake, which is morally questionable. The idea that \"they brought it on themselves\" doesn't necessarily justify blackmail. The ethical thing would be to delete the photos and not use them for any purpose, even if it's to teach them a lesson.\n\nAnother angle: The OP is planning to use their power over the senders for personal gain (money), which is a form of exploitation. Even if the senders are at fault, the OP's actions are not morally acceptable because they are causing intentional harm for their own benefit.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
