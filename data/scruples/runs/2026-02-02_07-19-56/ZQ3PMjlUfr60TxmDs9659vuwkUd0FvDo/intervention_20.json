He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking about legal consequences, just morality.\n\nFirst, the scenario: People sent the author explicit photos without consent. The author is thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders, demanding money. They mention they're a struggling college student, so maybe they're looking for a way to get money. They also say they \"own\" the photos because they were sent by the other person.\n\nMoral standpoint. So, even though the senders did something wrong, does the author have the right to retaliate in kind? It seems like revenge, but is it justified? The key here is whether the ends justify the means. The author is taking something bad that was done to them and using it to do the same to others. That could be seen as a cycle of harm. Also, blackmail is generally considered unethical because it coerces people into giving money or other favors under threat of exposure. Even if the person being blackmailed was wrong first, the act of blackmail is still exploiting their mistake for personal gain. \n\nAnother angle: the author is using the fact that they have \"evidence\" as leverage. But morally, is it okay to take advantage of someone's past mistake? Probably not. It's like saying, \"You did something wrong, so I'm going to do the same or worse to get what I want.\" That's more about revenge than justice. Also, the author is in a position of power here by having their private photos. Using that power to extort money is unethical, regardless of the other person's actions.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that they \"own\" the photos because they were sent to them might not hold up morally. Ownership isn't the issue here; it's about consent and privacy. The senders didn't have consent to send the photos, so the author's possession of them doesn't make it right to use them for blackmail.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is taking morally wrong actions by threatening others with exposure for money. Even if the senders were wrong, the author's response is a form of extortion, which is not justified morally. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
