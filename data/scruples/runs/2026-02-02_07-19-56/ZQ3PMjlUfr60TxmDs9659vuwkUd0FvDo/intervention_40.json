He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking about legal consequences, just the moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author received many unsolicited explicit photos from strangers and people they know. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders, making them send money or face having the pics go public. The author mentions they're a struggling college student, which might be a motive. They also reference another person's situation where someone was blackmailed, and the author found it funny that the victim got his comeuppance for sending a dick pic.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author wants to retaliate against senders of unsolicited explicit content by blackmailing them. The question is whether this is morally wrong.\n\nMorally, blackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves threatening someone to gain an advantage. Even if the person being blackmailed did something wrong (sending unsolicited pics), the act of blackmail is still exploitative. The author is taking something that the senders sent without consent and using it to extort money. That's a violation of trust and privacy, even if the original act was also inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"an eye for an eye.\" The author might feel justified because the senders acted inconsiderately. However, retaliation doesn't solve the problem; it just perpetuates a cycle of harm. The author's action would cause distress to the senders, similar to what the friend in the story experienced. The author admitted that the friend's situation was funny, but if they were to do the same, they'd be putting others through the same fear and anxiety. That seems hypocritical and morally inconsistent.\n\nAlso, the author claims to \"own\" the photos since they were sent by the senders. Legally, ownership isn't straightforward, but morally, the photos were sent without permission, so the senders were at fault. However, the author's response of blackmail is still unethical because it's using someone else's mistake as a means to exploit them.\n\nMoreover, the author is considering this as a way to teach others a lesson. While the intention might be to deter future inappropriate behavior, the method is harmful. It's a form of punishment that's disproportionate and invasive. Instead of addressing the issue directly (like blocking or ignoring the senders), the author is choosing to retaliate in a way that causes real harm to others.\n\nIn summary, even though the senders acted inappropriately, the author's plan to blackmail them is a moral wrong. It's a harmful response that exploits the senders' mistakes for personal gain, causing them distress and violating their privacy.\n"
