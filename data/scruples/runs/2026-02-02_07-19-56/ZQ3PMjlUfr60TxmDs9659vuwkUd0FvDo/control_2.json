He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The situation is that the author has received many such photos from strangers and people they know. They mention they're not asking for legal advice but moral. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspect. The author is thinking of using the photos to get money from the senders. The original question is whether that's the asshole move.\n\nThe key points here are consent and exploitation. The photos were sent unsolicited, meaning the senders didn't ask for anything in return. The author is now considering using those photos as leverage. Even though the author has legal rights to the photos (assuming they do), morally, it's about using someone's mistake against them.\n\nThe senders likely sent the photos in a moment of impulse or thoughtlessness, not expecting retaliation. By blackmailing, the author is taking advantage of that mistake. It's a form of coercion, which is generally considered unethical because it involves threatening to expose something to get what you want.\n\nAlso, the author mentions being a struggling college student, which might imply they need money, but that doesn't justify blackmail. It's exploiting others' privacy for personal gain. Even if the senders made a wrong choice by sending the pics, the author's response is to take advantage rather than delete or ignore. That seems to cross a moral line.\n\nThe comparison to the friend's situation is interesting. The author finds it funny that the friend is being blackmailed, but then wants to do the same. There's a double standard here. If the author would be upset if someone did this to them, then it's hypocritical and morally wrong to do it to others.\n\nSo, morally, the author is using others' private mistakes against them for personal gain, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
