He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key points here are the moral implications, not the legal ones, as the author is already aware of legal repercussions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from a moral standpoint. The author is a victim of unwanted explicit content, which is definitely a violation of personal boundaries. However, they're now considering using that material to blackmail the senders. The question is whether this retaliation is morally justified.\n\nMoral frameworks often look at intentions and consequences. The author's intention is to get revenge and deter future inappropriate behavior. But is revenge a morally acceptable response? Some might argue that it's a form of justice, but others would say it perpetuates harm and cycles of retaliation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they are a struggling college student, which might add context to their motivation\u2014perhaps financial gain. Using someone else's private content without consent, even in retaliation, is a violation of their privacy and autonomy. This is similar to \"taking an eye for an eye,\" which is a classic example of retributive justice but is often critiqued for being harmful.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of proportionality. The original act (sending unsolicited explicit images) is a violation, but blackmailing in response escalates the situation. It could lead to severe consequences for the victims, such as reputational damage or financial loss. This seems disproportionate and could be seen as taking advantage of the initial wrongdoing, which might not be ethically justified.\n\nAdditionally, there's a power dynamic here. The author, as the recipient, now has leverage over those who sent the pics. Using that leverage for personal gain, regardless of the initial wrongdoing, can be seen as exploiting the situation. Morality often emphasizes empathy and not causing further harm. Even if the senders acted inappropriately, the author's actions could cause them significant distress.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the senders initiated the harm by sending unsolicited content, so the author is merely enforcing consequences. However, this line of thinking can justify harmful actions under the guise of \"moral\" response. The key is whether the response aligns with ethical principles like fairness, respect, and minimizing harm.\n\nIn summary, while the author was wronged initially, retaliating with blackmail introduces new harms and doesn't resolve the underlying issue. It's a cycle of wrongdoing, so from a moral perspective, the author is likely in the wrong for considering such a response.\n"
