He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for blackmailing guys who sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mention they've received a lot of these over the years and now want to take advantage by threatening to share the photos unless they get money.\n\nFirst, from a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves using threats to extort money or other benefits. Even if the person feels justified, like the original poster (OP) in the story they mentioned who was being blackmailed, the act itself is ethically problematic. The key here is consent and intent. The people sending the dick pics did so without permission, which is invasive and inappropriate. However, the response of blackmail is also a form of coercion and manipulation. \n\nThe author argues they \"technically own the photos\" since they were sent by the perpetrators. But ownership here is a legal concept, and morally, just because something is sent to you doesn't give you the right to misuse it. Using those photos to blackmail others is a form of retaliation that crosses into harmful behavior. It's a cycle of harm where the initial wrongdoing isn't a valid excuse for committing a similar or worse action.\n\nAlso, the author is using humor and a \"hilarious\" reaction to the friend's situation, which might indicate they don't take the seriousness of blackmailing into account. They might be trying to justify their actions by comparing it to the friend's experience, but that doesn't negate the ethical issues. Even if someone's actions were wrong (like sending unsolicited photos), retaliating with blackmail doesn't make it right. It's about accountability without perpetuating harm.\n\nMoreover, the author is in a position of power here, using the private photos to gain money. This can cause significant distress and potentially ruin lives for the people being blackmailed. The moral standpoint usually values empathy and the greater good; blackmailing lacks empathy for the other person's well-being and seeks personal gain from their mistake.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author is in the wrong. The act of blackmailing, regardless of the initial wrongdoing, is morally incorrect. The justification of \"they sent it to me\" doesn't override the ethical issues of coercion and exploitation.\n"
