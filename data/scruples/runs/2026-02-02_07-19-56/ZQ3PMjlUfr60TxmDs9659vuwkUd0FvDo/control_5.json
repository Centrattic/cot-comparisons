He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The original question is from a \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario, so the focus is on morality, not legality.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from a moral standpoint. The author received unsolicited explicit images, which is a violation of their privacy and boundaries. The sender is the one at fault here for initiating the inappropriate behavior. The author is contemplating blackmail as a form of revenge or deterrent. \n\nBut morally, does the author have the right to retaliate? Just because someone wronged you doesn't mean you can do the same thing back. Blackmailing someone is a serious violation in itself. Even if the sender is guilty of sending unsolicited pics, the author's response also causes harm. The author is considering using the photos to extort money, which is a form of coercion. This creates a cycle of harm and could lead to further negative consequences for the senders, even if they were the initial wrongdoers.\n\nAlso, the author mentions organizing a gallery, which shows they've been collecting these images. That could imply they've enjoyed or at least found amusement in the situation, which might be seen as not taking the issue seriously. However, the key point here is the proposed blackmail. Even if the author feels wronged, retaliating with blackmail is not morally justified. It's about whether the ends justify the means. Taking money through coercion is inherently unethical, regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n\nSo, from a moral perspective, the author is in the wrong because they are choosing to engage in a harmful and unethical action as a response, even if the other party was at fault. The correct answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
