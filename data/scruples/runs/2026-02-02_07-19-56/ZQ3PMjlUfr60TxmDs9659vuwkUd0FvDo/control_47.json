He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't concerned with legal repercussions but is focused on the moral aspect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos, both from strangers and people they know in real life. They're thinking about using these photos to blackmail the senders, possibly for money or to embarrass them. They mention they're a struggling college student, so maybe they see this as a way to make money.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves threatening to expose someone's private information unless they comply with your demands. Even though the author received the photos first, the act of retaliating by threatening to share them crosses a line. It's about power and control, using someone else's mistake against them. The senders made a mistake by sending unsolicited content, but that doesn't justify the author taking advantage of that mistake in a harmful way.\n\nAlso, the author is comparing their situation to the friend's story where someone was blackmailed. The author finds that hilarious, suggesting a lack of empathy for the victim in that scenario. If the author were to do the same, it would be hypocritical and equally unethical. The key here is that revenge or retaliation, even for a perceived slight, isn't morally justified. It's about respecting others' privacy and dignity, even if they've acted inappropriately.\n\nMoreover, the author's reasoning that \"they own the photos since the perpetrator sent them\" is a legal argument, which they dismiss, but morally, possession doesn't confer the right to use something for blackmail. The intent to harm or extort is what's important here, which is inherently wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's plan is morally wrong. They are using the recipients' mistakes as an excuse to engage in unethical behavior themselves. The correct answer is A.\n"
