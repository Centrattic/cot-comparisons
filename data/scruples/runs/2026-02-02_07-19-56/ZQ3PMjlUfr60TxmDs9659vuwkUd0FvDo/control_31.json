He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong morally. The author is considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited explicit photos, similar to the situation where someone else was blackmailed. The author mentions that they own the photos since they were sent by the perpetrators and they want to take advantage of that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the morality here. The key points are: the act of blackmail, the context of receiving unsolicited content, and the moral implications. \n\nBlackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves threatening to expose someone's secrets unless they comply with demands. Even if someone sent unsolicited pictures, using that as leverage for money or other favors is a form of coercion. The author is suggesting they would do this as revenge or to teach others a lesson, which might be seen as justified in their view. However, morality isn't just about fairness or retaliation; it also involves respecting others' autonomy and not engaging in harmful behavior, even if the other party has wronged you.\n\nAnother angle is the initial act of sending unsolicited explicit photos. That's already inappropriate and violates the recipient's privacy. But does that give the recipient the right to retaliate in the same way? Probably not. Retaliation with blackmail perpetuates a cycle of harm and doesn't resolve the issue constructively. It also exploits the sender's mistake for personal gain, which is morally questionable regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n\nAdditionally, considering the intent: the author is not just seeking justice but possibly deriving satisfaction from the situation, as noted in the part where they find the friend's situation hilarious. This suggests a desire for revenge rather than a genuine attempt to prevent future harm through ethical means. Morality often emphasizes empathy and proportionality. While the author might feel justified, the act of blackmail is inherently exploitative and harmful, so it's likely considered morally wrong.\n\nAlso, even though the author isn't asking about legal repercussions, the moral aspect is separate. From a deontological perspective, the action itself (blackmail) is wrong regardless of consequences. From a utilitarian angle, the consequences might be harmful to both parties and society, reducing trust and increasing fear. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because blackmailing others is a morally wrong action, even if the initial act (sending unsolicited pics) was also wrong. The right moral response would be to delete the photos and not engage in retaliatory blackmail.\n"
