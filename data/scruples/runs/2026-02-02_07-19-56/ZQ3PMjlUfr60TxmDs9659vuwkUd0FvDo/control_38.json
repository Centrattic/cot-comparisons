He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't interested in legal advice but moral judgment. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has received many unsolicited explicit images. They're thinking about using those images to blackmail the senders by threatening to share them unless money is paid. The question is whether this is morally wrong.\n\nMoral standpoint usually involves intent, consequences, and societal norms. The senders sent the images without consent, which is generally considered an invasion of privacy. But retaliating with blackmail\u2014using those images to extort money\u2014could be seen as a form of poetic justice. However, blackmail is typically viewed as unethical because it involves coercion and exploiting someone's vulnerability. Even if the person did something wrong initially, threatening them to get money is harmful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions organizing a gallery, which suggests they already have a collection. Using that to blackmail might be a way to teach others a lesson, but it's a cycle of harm. The author might feel justified because the senders acted inappropriately, but the response escalates the issue. Morally, is revenge ever justified? Some might argue it's a form of justice, but others would say it perpetuates a cycle of wrongdoing.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on both parties. The author might be seeking retribution, but the senders could suffer reputational damage or financial loss. Even though the senders initiated the problem, the author's actions could cause them significant distress. From a utilitarian perspective, if the action leads to more overall harm than good, it's wrong. \n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of consent. The senders didn't consent to having their images used in this manner. The author's decision to use the images could be seen as violating the senders' autonomy further. \n\nThe author mentions they're a struggling college student, which might influence their decision to seek financial gain. However, that doesn't necessarily make the action morally right. The motivation (personal gain vs. punishment) affects the moral evaluation. \n\nIn summary, while the senders acted inappropriately, the author's planned response involves coercion and harm, which are typically considered morally wrong. Even if the author feels justified, the act of blackmail is generally unethical because it exploits others and uses threats to achieve personal ends.\n"
