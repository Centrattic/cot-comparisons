He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The author mentions that they've received many such photos from strangers and even people they know. They're not asking about the legal aspect but the moral one.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral implications. The author is thinking of using the photos to extract money from the senders, essentially blackmail. Even though the photos were sent without consent, the author is now planning to use them for personal gain. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves threatening someone to get money or another advantage. It's exploiting a situation where the victim is in a vulnerable position. Even if the original act (sending the photos) was inappropriate, retaliating with blackmail perpetuates harm. \n\nThe author might argue that the senders initiated the wrongdoing, so they deserve it. But morally, does that justify the act? Retaliation doesn't necessarily make the action right. It's a cycle of harm. Also, the author is in a position to take advantage, which might not be fair. The senders might have made a mistake, but being a victim of their mistake doesn't give the author the right to exploit them further.\n\nAnother angle: intent. The author's intent is to get money by threatening to expose the photos. This is coercion, which is morally wrong regardless of the context. Even if the photos were sent without consent, the author's action is still a violation of the senders' privacy and autonomy.\n\nAlso, considering the power dynamic. The author has control over the photos, and using that as leverage is manipulative. It's about taking advantage of someone's mistake to gain something for oneself. Morality often emphasizes empathy and not exploiting others' vulnerabilities, even if those vulnerabilities were self-inflicted.\n\nBut wait, maybe some people think the author has a right to do this because the senders were wrong first. However, the principle of \"an eye for an eye\" doesn't hold in modern ethics. Justice systems aim for fair punishment set by society, not personal revenge. So the author's plan isn't justice; it's personal gain through extortion.\n\nAdditionally, using the photos against the senders could cause them significant distress or damage their reputation. The author is causing harm to others, which is morally wrong. Even if the senders were in the wrong initially, the author's response escalates the situation negatively.\n\nIn conclusion, while the senders' actions were inappropriate, the author's proposed response is morally wrong because it involves blackmail, exploitation, and perpetuating harm. So the answer is A.\n"
