He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmail against people who sent unsolicited dick pics. They mentioned they're not interested in legal advice, just moral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author received many unsolicited explicit photos and is thinking about using them to blackmail the senders. They argue that since the senders sent the photos, they deserve some consequences. But morally, is this justified?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves using threats to gain something, often exploiting someone's vulnerabilities. Even though the senders did something inappropriate by sending unsolicited pics, retaliating with blackmail could be seen as taking justice into one's own hands, which isn't a moral approach. The author might feel wronged, but responding with blackmail could cause harm and isn't a constructive solution. It might also perpetuate a cycle of harassment or exploitation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the senders initiated the harassment, so the author has a right to retaliate. But morally, most frameworks emphasize proportionality and the rule of law. Instead of blackmail, the appropriate response would be to ignore, block, or report the senders. Using their own photos against them could lead to further issues, like revenge porn or emotional distress.\n\nAlso, the author mentions being a struggling college student, implying they might be using this as a way to get money, which adds a selfish motive. This could make the action more morally wrong, as it's not just about stopping harassment but also about personal gain.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong morally. The answer would be A.\n"
