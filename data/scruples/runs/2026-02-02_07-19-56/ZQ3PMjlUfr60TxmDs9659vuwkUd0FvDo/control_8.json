He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key here is the moral standpoint, not legal.\n\nFirst, the author received unwanted explicit photos. People who send these are clearly violating boundaries. But then the author is thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders. Even though the author owns the photos, the act of blackmail involves threatening to expose someone unless they comply with demands. \n\nMorally, blackmail is generally seen as wrong because it exploits others for personal gain. Even if the victim is someone who acted inconsiderately, using their misdeeds to extort money or other favors is a form of coercion. It perpetuates harm and could lead to further issues like emotional distress for the senders. Plus, it sets a problematic precedent where the author is also engaging in unethical behavior, even if they were the initial victims of harassment.\n\nSo, even though the senders are at fault for sending unsolicited content, the author's response of blackmailing them crosses into morally wrong territory. The right thing would be to ignore or block the senders instead of retaliating with blackmail. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
