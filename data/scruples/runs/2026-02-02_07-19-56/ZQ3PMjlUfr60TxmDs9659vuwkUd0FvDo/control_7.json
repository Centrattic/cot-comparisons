He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't concerned with legal repercussions, just morality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspect. The people sending unsolicited explicit images are clearly violating the recipient's privacy and consent. From a moral standpoint, the sender is in the wrong for initiating that behavior. \n\nBut then, if the recipient uses those images to blackmail the senders, is that morally acceptable? The author argues they're taking back control, but blackmail involves coercion and threats, which are generally considered unethical regardless of the context. Even if the original action was wrong, retaliating with threats might not be justified because it escalates harm. \n\nAlso, the idea of \"taking advantage\" by threatening to share the images could be seen as exploiting the sender's mistake for personal gain. The author might be seeking revenge or financial gain, which can be viewed as morally wrong because it perpetuates a cycle of harm. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the original act (sending unsolicited pics) was so wrong that the recipient has a right to retaliate. But morality often emphasizes proportionality and doing no harm. Blackmailing could lead to significant emotional distress for the sender, which might not be proportionate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's plan to blackmail, despite the sender's wrongdoing, is likely in the wrong from a moral perspective because it involves unethical actions and could cause undue harm.\n"
