He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't concerned with legal repercussions but is asking from a moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The people sending the pics were the ones who initiated an unwanted and often creepy action. The author is retaliating by threatening to expose those photos unless money is paid. So, even though the sender might have done something wrong, does that justify the author doing the same?\n\nFrom a moral point of view, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves coercion and threats for personal gain. Even if the target deserves it, using blackmail is a form of revenge that can cause harm. The author is taking advantage of a situation created by others, but the act itself is still unethical because it's about extracting something (money) through fear.\n\nAlso, the author mentions organizing a \"phallus gallery,\" which suggests they already have a collection. Using that to blackmail people might be seen as taking things too far, even if the originals were sent without consent. The author is now the one causing distress, which isn't justified morally, regardless of the other person's actions.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position where they feel wronged, but responding with the same harmful behavior doesn't resolve the issue. Morality often emphasizes not perpetuating cycles of harm. So even if the original action was wrong, retaliating in kind isn't the ethical choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because blackmail is morally wrong regardless of the circumstances. Even if the other person was at fault, using blackmail is a harmful and unethical response.\n"
