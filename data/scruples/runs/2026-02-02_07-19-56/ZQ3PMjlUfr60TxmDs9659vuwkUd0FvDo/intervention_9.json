He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is talking about receiving unsolicited dick pics from various people\u2014strangers and people they know in real life. They mention that they've collected enough to make a gallery. Now, they're considering blackmailing these guys by threatening to share the pics unless they send money, similar to the guy in the legal advice post. The question is whether the author is morally in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the moral perspective. The author is justifying their actions by saying the victims sent the pics themselves, so they \"own\" the photos. But does that give them the right to blackmail someone else? Even if someone does something wrong, like sending unsolicited explicit images, does the recipient have the right to retaliate in kind?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves using threats to extort money or favors. Even if the person being blackmailed did something questionable, using coercion to get money isn't right. The author is taking advantage of the victims' mistakes for their own gain, which is exploitative. It's a form of taking the wrongdoing of others and perpetuating harm, which seems unethical.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they're a struggling college student, implying financial need as a motive. But that doesn't necessarily justify blackmail. There are other ways to handle financial struggles without resorting to extortion. The author's reasoning might be a form of moral justification for their actions, but it doesn't make the actions themselves right.\n\nAnother angle: if someone sends unsolicited explicit photos, they're clearly violating social norms and possibly privacy boundaries. The recipient has a responsibility to protect that privacy, not exploit it. By blackmailing the senders, the author is violating that trust, even if the senders were in the wrong first. The author's actions would further harm the victims and contribute to a cycle of coercion and exploitation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the victims brought it upon themselves by sending the pics. However, that's a victim-blaming perspective. Even if someone makes a poor choice, they shouldn't be subjected to blackmail. The right to privacy and consent applies regardless of who initiated the behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is engaging in blackmail, which is morally wrong regardless of the victims' actions. The fact that they're a struggling student doesn't mitigate the moral wrongness. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
