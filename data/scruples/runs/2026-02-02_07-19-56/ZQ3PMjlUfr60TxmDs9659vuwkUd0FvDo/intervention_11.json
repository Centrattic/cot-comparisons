He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who received unsolicited dick pics and is considering blackmailing the senders. The author is aware of the legal repercussions but is asking from a moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the morality here. The main points are unsolicited explicit images and retaliation. The author is planning to take the photos they received (which were sent without permission) and use them to blackmail the senders. The question is whether this is morally wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the senders initiated the situation by sending unsolicited content, which is generally considered inappropriate and a violation of consent. However, the author's response is to take the received images and use them against the senders. Even though the author has the photos because they were sent to them, using them for blackmail is a form of revenge. \n\nMorally, revenge can be seen as unjustified, especially if it causes harm. Even if the initial action (sending unsolicited pics) was wrong, retaliating with blackmail might escalate the situation and cause more harm than good. It could lead to emotional distress for the senders, potential exploitation, and perpetuates a cycle of retaliation. \n\nAnother angle is about consent and privacy. The senders didn't ask for the photos to be kept or used. Even if they sent them voluntarily, they might not have realized the recipient would use them in this way. The author is taking something shared inappropriately and using it to leverage money or other favors, which is a misuse of the information they have. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they're a struggling student, so maybe they're considering this as a way to get money. But morally, is it right to exploit others' mistakes for personal gain? It's like taking advantage of someone's wrongdoing to benefit oneself, which can be seen as unethical. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is holding the senders accountable for their actions. However, accountability doesn't necessarily mean blackmail. There are other ways to address the issue, like ignoring the senders or educating them on the inappropriateness of their actions. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the senders are at fault, the author's choice to retaliate in such a way could be considered wrong because it's a harmful and manipulative response. The line between justice and revenge is thin here. The author is taking matters into their own hands in a way that could be seen as bullying or extortion. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's plan to blackmail the senders is a morally wrong action. It's about using someone else's mistake against them in a harmful way, which can't be justified ethically.\n"
