He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is considering blackmailing guys who sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mention that someone else was being blackmailed, and the author finds that funny because it might make the victim think twice. Now, the author wants to do the same\u2014organize the photos into a gallery and maybe blackmail these people for money, claiming they technically own the photos since the others sent them. They\u2019re asking if they\u2019re the asshole, not from a legal perspective but a moral one.\n\nSo, the key points here are: unsolicited photos, the author wanting to retaliate by blackmailing, using the photos to get money, and claiming ownership. The question is about morality, not legality.\n\nFirst, I should consider the act of blackmail itself. Blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves threatening to expose something embarrassing unless money is paid. Even if the person did something wrong first, using that as a means to extort money is a form of exploitation. The author is taking something that was given without permission and then using it against the sender. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The photos were sent without the author's consent, and the author is now using that lack of consent to their advantage. Even though the author might argue they \"own\" the photos, the original act of sending them was a violation. But retaliating in kind doesn't necessarily make it right. It's a cycle of harm\u2014responding to a violation with another violation.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author's main motivation seems to be to get money, but also to teach these people a lesson by making them think twice. However, the method of teaching that lesson is through extortion, which is harmful. It's not just about the action but the impact. Blackmail can cause significant stress and financial harm to the victims, which is morally questionable regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of proportionality. Sending unsolicited photos is inappropriate, but retaliating with blackmail might be an excessive response. It's a form of punishment that can have severe consequences for the other person, even if they were the first to act inappropriately. The moral high ground isn't necessarily there if the response is more harmful than the initial act.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is just returning the favor, creating a deterrent. But that's a slippery slope\u2014using the same unethical tactics as the offenders doesn't make it right. It's a form of tit-for-tat that can escalate into more serious issues. Morality often considers the intent and the broader implications, not just the immediate action.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is planning to use blackmail as a form of justice for receiving unsolicited photos. While the initial act by the senders was wrong, the author's response involves exploiting that wrongdoing for personal gain, which is morally questionable. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
