He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who has received unsolicited dick pics from various people and is considering blackmailing them for money, using the photos they have.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral standpoint. The author is holding photos that others sent without permission and thinking about using them to get money. The key here is that the people sending the pics were the ones who initiated the situation. They sent the photos unsolicited, which is generally seen as inappropriate and disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the author's response is to retaliate. Even though the initial action by the senders was wrong, blackmailing them could be morally questionable. Blackmail is about using threats to get someone to do something they wouldn't otherwise do, which is coercive. Even if the victim initiated the situation, using the photos to blackmail might not be justified morally because it's still manipulating someone into giving money they don't want to give.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they technically own the photos since they were sent by the perpetrators. But morally, just because you have the photos doesn't mean you have the right to use them in a harmful way. The senders might have expected the photos to be deleted, but that doesn't give the receiver the right to retaliate in kind. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"an eye for an eye\" versus forgiveness. Retaliation can lead to a cycle of harm. Even if the senders were in the wrong, does that justify the author doing the same? It's a gray area, but from a moral standpoint, many would argue that responding with blackmail escalates the situation rather than resolving it. It also could cause financial and emotional distress to the senders, which isn't justified as a response.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The author didn't consent to receive those photos, but using them to blackmail others also violates their consent in a different way. So, the author's actions would be a form of coercion, which is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, even though the initial act by the senders was wrong, the author's response of blackmail is still in the wrong. Hence, the answer should be A.\n"
