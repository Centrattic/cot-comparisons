He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't looking for legal advice but moral judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos, both from strangers and people they know in real life. They're considering using these photos to blackmail the senders. The key points here are consent, privacy, and revenge.\n\nThe senders of the pics might not have realized the consequences of their actions. They sent the photos unsolicited, which is already a violation of the recipient's privacy. However, does that justify the recipient taking the same approach and blackmailing them? From a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves coercion and threats for personal gain, even if the victim is at fault in some way.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"an eye for an eye.\" The author is retaliating in a similar manner. But does that make it morally acceptable? Retaliation can create a cycle of harm. Even if the senders were wrong, using their own methods might not be just. The author's action could cause significant harm to the senders, potentially affecting their lives in serious ways, like public humiliation or financial loss.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they technically own the photos since they were sent to them. But ownership doesn't necessarily equate to moral right to use them in a harmful way. There's a difference between having legal rights (which the author isn't asking about) and using those rights ethically.\n\nMoreover, there's the aspect of power dynamics. The author is in a position to expose or harm someone else, which can be abused. Even if the senders are at fault, the author's action would be exploiting their mistake. It's a question of whether the ends justify the means. Retaliation might feel justified as a form of justice, but from a moral perspective, it's important to consider the broader implications and the message it sends about how we treat others, even when they're wrong.\n\nIn summary, while the senders are in the wrong for sending unsolicited content, the author's plan to blackmail them would also be morally wrong because it involves coercion, threats, and causing harm, which doesn't align with ethical principles of justice and mercy.\n"
