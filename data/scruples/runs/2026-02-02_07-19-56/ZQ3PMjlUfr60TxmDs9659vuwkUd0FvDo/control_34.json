He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking about legal consequences but moral ones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. The people sending the pics are clearly the ones in the wrong here. They sent unsolicited photos, which is a violation of the receiver's privacy and boundaries. So, the author is responding to a wrongdoing.\n\nBut the author wants to use the photos for blackmail. Even if the sender was at fault, does that justify the author's actions? Well, blackmail is typically seen as wrong because it's using someone's mistake to gain personal benefit, which can be coercive and harmful. Even if the victim is the one who made the initial mistake, retaliating in a harmful way might not be morally justified. It's like saying \"you did something bad, so I'll do something worse to get what I want.\" That creates a cycle of harm.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, taking revenge or exploiting someone's mistake for personal gain, even if the other person was wrong, isn't considered ethical. The author could be trying to teach a lesson or get compensation, but the method is extortion. So, even if the original action was wrong, the response is also morally wrong because it's about using coercion and causing further harm.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions being a struggling college student, which might be a motive for seeking money, but that doesn't make the action right. The moral question is about the rightness of the action itself, not the intent behind it. So, even if the author is in a tough spot, blackmail isn't the solution.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they are choosing to engage in blackmail as a form of retaliation, which is morally unacceptable regardless of the initial wrongdoing by others.\n"
