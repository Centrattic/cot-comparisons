He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author mentions they've received many such photos and are thinking about using them to get money, similar to the situation they read about. They clarify they're not asking for legal advice but moral.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the morality here. The key points are unsolicited photos, the author's intent to blackmail, and the potential harm to others. The photos were sent without consent, so the sender is the one who initiated an invasion of privacy. However, the author is now considering using those same photos against the senders. Even though the senders acted inappropriately, retaliating with blackmail is a form of taking advantage of their mistake for personal gain. \n\nMoral judgments often consider the intent and the consequences. The author's intent here is to get money, which is self-serving. Even if the senders were wrong, the author's actions would cause emotional distress and potentially harm the senders' reputations. The author is using someone else's mistake as a weapon, which is generally seen as unethical. \n\nAlso, there's a power imbalance. The senders might not have intended for their photos to be used this way, and the author is in a position to do so. Morality often emphasizes empathy and considering others' well-being. The author isn't showing empathy towards the senders; instead, they're looking to exploit the situation. \n\nEven though the author is a victim of unsolicited content, seeking revenge or financial gain through blackmail isn't morally justified. It's a form of vigilantism that can escalate the problem and teach a bad lesson. The right approach might be to ignore or report such messages, not to retaliate. \n\nTherefore, from a moral standpoint, the author is in the wrong because blackmailing someone, regardless of their initial mistake, is ethically unacceptable.\n"
