He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nThe user is asking if blackmailing guys who sent unsolicited dick pics is morally wrong. The author mentions that they received many such photos from strangers and people they know IRL. They're considering using this to blackmail them, maybe by threatening to share the photos unless money is sent. The author isn't concerned with legal consequences, just the moral aspect.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Unsolicited dick pics are unwanted and can be seen as inappropriate or even harassing. The author is responding in kind by considering blackmail. But is that justified? \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, revenge or blackmail is generally frowned upon. Even if someone does something wrong, retaliating in the same way might not be considered ethical. The author is taking the same action that they disapprove of others doing\u2014using the photos to extort money. So there's a hypocrisy here, maybe. They find the friend's situation funny, which suggests they don't take it seriously. But they're planning to do the same. \n\nAlso, the author is a struggling college student, which might explain the motivation to get money. However, moral reasoning doesn't typically justify actions based on personal hardship. Even if someone is in a tough spot, using illegal or immoral methods to get money isn't considered right. \n\nAnother angle: consent. The photos were sent without the author's consent, but by keeping and using them, the author is now using them against the senders. Even if the photos were sent to them, does that give them the right to use them? Probably not. The senders didn't consent to this use either. \n\nIntent matters too. The author's intent is to get money, which is a form of coercion. Blackmail is typically seen as a crime because it's about using threats to gain something. Morally, it's about respecting others' autonomy and not causing harm. By threatening to share the photos, the author is causing emotional harm and financial loss, which is unethical.\n\nAlso, the author seems to trivialize the situation by humor, like organizing a \"phallus gallery.\" This might indicate a lack of empathy towards the senders, which is a red flag in moral reasoning. If you can't empathize with others, even those who wronged you, that's a problem.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author is taking an unethical action (blackmail) in response to an unethical action (unsolicited photos). But retaliation with the same unethical method doesn't make it right. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
