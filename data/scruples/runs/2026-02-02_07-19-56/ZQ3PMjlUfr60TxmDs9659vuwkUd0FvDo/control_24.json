He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about someone considering blackmailing men who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author mentions they've received many such photos from strangers and even people they know in real life. They're thinking about using these photos to blackmail the senders, not from a legal standpoint but morally.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the moral aspects here. The author is thinking of taking photos that were sent to them without consent and then threatening to expose them unless money is paid. That's blackmail, which is generally considered unethical. The question is about morality, not legality, but we know that blackmail is also illegal, but the user specified to ignore legal advice.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the key points are consent and the right to privacy. The senders of the photos did so without the author's consent, but the author is now considering using that violation of their own privacy against the senders. However, using someone's private information against them for personal gain (money) is typically seen as wrong. Even if the sender did something wrong themselves, the act of blackmail is a form of coercion and exploitation.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of tit for tat. The author might feel that the senders deserve it because they sent unsolicited content. But morally, does that justify blackmail? Retribution isn't necessarily a moral justification. It's more about the harm caused. The author's action would cause harm to others, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nAlso, the author mentions organizing a \"phallus gallery,\" which indicates they already have these photos stored. Using them for blackmail would be taking advantage of someone else's mistake to benefit oneself, which is exploitative. It's a form of manipulating the situation rather than addressing it in a more constructive way, like blocking the senders or reporting them.\n\nEven if the author feels wronged, the response of blackmailing them is a step further into unethical behavior. It's about respecting others' dignity and privacy, regardless of their past actions. So, morally, the author is in the wrong because they're perpetuating harm and exploitation for personal gain.\n"
