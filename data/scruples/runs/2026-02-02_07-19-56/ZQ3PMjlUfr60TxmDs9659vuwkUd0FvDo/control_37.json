He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key points here are the moral aspect, not the legal. \n\nFirst, the author received a lot of unwanted photos, which is definitely annoying and invasive. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders, similar to the situation they read about where someone was blackmailed by a foreign girl. The author finds the idea of that scenario funny and hopes it teaches the guy a lesson.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, even if the author is a victim of unwanted messages, does that justify them retaliating in the same harmful way? Blackmail is generally considered wrong because it's about using someone's vulnerability to gain something, often money. Even if the other people were at fault for sending the pics, the act of blackmailing them would still be exploitative. \n\nThe author might feel justified because they were the recipient of harassment, but revenge doesn't necessarily make the action right. It's a cycle of harm. Also, the author mentions they \"own\" the photos, but that's more a legal claim. Morally, using someone else's private content to extort them is still a bad choice, regardless of who initiated the situation.\n\nSo even though the senders were wrong to send unsolicited pics, the author's plan to blackmail them would be morally wrong. The right thing would be to block, delete, or perhaps report, but not to retaliate with blackmail. Hence, the author is in the wrong."
