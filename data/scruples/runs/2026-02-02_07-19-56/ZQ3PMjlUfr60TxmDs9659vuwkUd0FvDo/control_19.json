He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this post is in the wrong when considering blackmailing people who send unsolicited dick pics. The user specifies that they're not looking for legal advice but a moral perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author received unsolicited explicit photos from various people. Now, they're thinking about blackmailing those individuals because they sent the photos. The author mentions that they own the photos since they were sent by the perpetrators. But the question is about morality, not legality.\n\nSo, morally, is it wrong to blackmail someone? Blackmail typically involves threatening to expose someone's private information unless they comply with a demand, usually money. Even if the person who sent the photo did something questionable by sending it without consent, does that justify the recipient taking advantage?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, actions are judged based on intent, consequences, and fairness. The sender's action of sending unsolicited photos is inappropriate and invasive. However, the recipient retaliating by blackmailing them could be seen as a form of justice, but it's also a violation of the sender's rights. Even if the sender made a mistake, blackmail is a harmful act that coerces and harms the other person. It perpetuates a cycle of exploitation and can cause significant distress, especially if the photos are sensitive.\n\nThe author might argue that the senders should have known better, but that doesn't excuse the act of blackmail. Morality often emphasizes empathy and proportionality. Instead of retaliating, the ethical approach might be to delete the photos and discourage such behavior without causing further harm. Additionally, using the photos for personal gain or to extort money is not morally justified, regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author would be in the wrong because blackmail is an immoral act regardless of the circumstances. It's about holding someone accountable through coercion, which is not ethically acceptable.\n"
