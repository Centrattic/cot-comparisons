He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The original question is from a WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) context, so the user is looking for a moral judgment, not legal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders by asking for money, threatening to share the pics. They mention they're not asking about legal consequences, just morality.\n\nNow, considering morality. Unsolicited explicit images are a violation of privacy and consent. The senders sent them without permission, which is already inappropriate. The author is considering using the received images to get money from the senders. Even though the author technically has the photos, using them for blackmail is a form of coercion. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves using someone's secrets against them for personal gain. Even if the person being blackmailed did something wrong, threatening to expose them unless they comply isn't morally justified. The author's actions would be exploiting the senders' mistakes, which is unethical. \n\nAlso, the author might have the right to delete the photos but doesn't have the right to use them to harm or extort the senders. Revenge or taking advantage in this way isn't considered moral. The author could argue self-defense or deterrence, but morality usually values empathy and not causing further harm. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because blackmail is morally unacceptable regardless of the context.\n"
