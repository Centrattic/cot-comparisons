He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author mentions they've received many such photos from strangers and even people they know in real life. They want to use these photos to blackmail the senders, not legally but morally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The original senders acted inappropriately by sending unsolicited explicit photos, which is generally considered rude and can be a form of harassment. The author is thinking of retaliating by threatening to share these photos unless money is sent. \n\nNow, morally, is it okay to take revenge like this? Even if the other person did something wrong, does the author become the villain by doing the same? Retaliation can be a slippery slope. While the senders are at fault for initiating the situation, the author's response is equally harmful. It's a cycle of negative behavior. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they're a struggling college student, which might be their justification. But using someone else's mistake as a way to gain something for yourself isn't morally right. The author is taking advantage of the senders' poor judgment, which is exploiting them. \n\nEven though the author might feel justified, from a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally seen as wrong because it coerces someone into giving up something (money) through threats. It doesn't matter if the other person was wrong first; the act of blackmailing is its own moral wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because blackmailing, regardless of the initial wrongdoing, is not morally acceptable. It perpetuates harm and doesn't address the issue constructively. The right approach would be to ignore or block such messages rather than retaliate.\n"
