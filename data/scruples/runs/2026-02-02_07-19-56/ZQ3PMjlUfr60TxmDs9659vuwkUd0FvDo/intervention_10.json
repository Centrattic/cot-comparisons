He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is considering blackmailing people who have sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mention they're not asking for legal advice but moral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The people who sent the pics are the ones who initiated the unwanted behavior. Sending unsolicited images is generally seen as inappropriate and invasive. The author is thinking of using those photos to blackmail them, which is a form of coercion.\n\nNow, even though the senders were wrong, using blackmail is a form of retaliation. Morally, is this justified? One perspective is that the author is taking justice into their own hands, punishing people for their wrongdoing. But another angle is that blackmail is inherently wrong because it involves threatening to expose information for personal gain, regardless of the initial wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions being a struggling student, so maybe they see this as a way to get money. But does that make it morally acceptable? Probably not. The ends don't always justify the means. Even if someone did something wrong, retaliating with blackmail could be seen as perpetuating a cycle of harm. It's about whether the author's actions are proportional and just.\n\nAnother thought: the author is in a position of power over the senders because they have the photos. Using that power to extort money could be seen as exploiting the senders' mistake, which is morally questionable. It's like saying, \"You did something bad, so I'll make you suffer by exposing you unless you give me money.\" But that's still coercion, which is ethically problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the senders deserve it because they initiated the inappropriate behavior. But morality often requires more than just proportionality; it's about respecting others' autonomy and rights. Even if someone is at fault, blackmailing them violates their rights and can cause harm beyond just the initial offense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the senders were wrong, the author's plan to blackmail them is morally wrong. It's taking an unethical action in response to another unethical action, which doesn't make it right. The author is using the photos to exploit others, which is a violation of trust and a form of manipulation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
