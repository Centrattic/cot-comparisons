He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The original poster (OP) mentions they've received many such photos over the years and are thinking about using them for blackmail, not from a legal but a moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The key here is the concept of consent and privacy. Even though the photos were sent unsolicited, the sender likely intended to share them, maybe out of inappropriate curiosity or a breach of boundaries. However, the OP is now considering using those photos to blackmail the senders. \n\nBlackmail typically involves threatening to expose someone's private information unless they comply with a demand, which is inherently coercive and exploitative. Even if the photos were sent without permission, the OP's intention to use them for personal gain (money or whatever) is a violation of the senders' privacy and autonomy. The senders didn't consent to the photos being used in this way, regardless of how they were obtained.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of reciprocity. If someone sends a dick pic without asking, they're violating the receiver's boundaries. But retaliating with blackmail escalates the situation. It's a form of taking the law into one's own hands and perpetuates a cycle of harm. Morally, it's about treating others as one would like to be treated. If the OP were in the sender's position, would they appreciate being blackmailed? Probably not, so this action is hypocritical and harmful.\n\nAlso, the OP's justification that \"they own the photos\" ignores the ethical responsibility that comes with possessing someone else's private content. Even if legally there might be some ownership (though in many cases, not necessarily), morally, using such content to extort someone is wrong because it exploits the sender's mistake or poor judgment.\n\nConsidering all that, the OP's plan is morally wrong. It's about using others' vulnerabilities for personal gain, which is a violation of trust and ethical conduct. So the answer should be A.\n"
