He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mention they\u2019re not asking legally, just morally.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the moral aspects. The author is retaliating against people who sent them photos without permission. Those people acted inappropriately by sending unsolicited explicit images, which is a violation of boundaries. However, the author's response is to blackmail them using those same photos. \n\nSo, even though the original action (sending the pics) was wrong, does that justify the author's response? From a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves coercion and potential harm. The author is using the photos to extort money, which could cause emotional distress or financial loss for the victims. \n\nEven though the author might feel like they're getting revenge for past wrongs, revenge itself is often seen as morally problematic because it can lead to a cycle of harm and doesn't address the root issues. The author is choosing to perpetuate harm instead of seeking a more constructive resolution, like blocking the individuals or ignoring the messages. \n\nAdditionally, the author claims ownership of the photos since they were sent to them. But taking something given without consent and then using it as leverage is still a form of exploitation. It's not just about ownership but how that ownership is used. Blackmail is using someone's vulnerability against them, which is ethically questionable regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author says they want to make the senders think twice. While that might be a deterrent, the method chosen is harmful. There are non-harmful ways to discourage such behavior, like not engaging or reporting it. The author's choice to retaliate with blackmail introduces new harm, which is morally worse than just ignoring the issue.\n\nAlso, considering the context of being a struggling student, maybe they're trying to make money, but that doesn't justify blackmail. The ends don't justify the means here. The author's actions could lead to further harm, like the photos being disseminated, which could damage the senders' lives. So, even if the senders are at fault, the author's method of response is excessive.\n\nIn summary, while the people sending the photos are in the wrong, the author's response of blackmail is also morally wrong because it's an unethical and harmful way to handle the situation. The author should seek to protect their own boundaries without engaging in coercive tactics.\n"
