He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key points here are the moral standpoint, not legal.\n\nFirst, the author received many unsolicited photos, which are considered invasive and inappropriate. The sender's actions were wrong, as sharing explicit content without consent is a violation of privacy. The author is now thinking of using those photos to blackmail the senders. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, even if the senders were at fault, retaliating with blackmail is a form of punishment that could be seen as unjust. The author is taking the photos they received and using them to extort money, which is a form of exploitation. Even though the senders started it, the author's actions would still be morally questionable because blackmail is generally considered wrong regardless of the context. \n\nAlso, the author is a struggling college student, which might add context to their motives, but it doesn't justify the act of blackmail. The moral judgment here isn't about the severity of the senders' actions but whether the author's response is ethically acceptable. \n\nSo, even if the senders were wrong, the author's plan to retaliate in kind crosses a line. It's a form of taking justice into their own hands, which can perpetuate a cycle of harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
