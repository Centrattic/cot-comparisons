He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong morally for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mentioned they want a moral answer, not legal.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author received a lot of unsolicited explicit images. They're thinking about using those to blackmail the senders, maybe to get money or teach them a lesson. They argue that since they own the photos, they can do whatever they want. But the question is about morality, not legality.\n\nMoral standpoint often involves intent and consequences. The author's intent here is to punish or teach others a lesson by threatening to expose the pictures unless they comply. But is that fair? Even if someone did something wrong, retaliating in kind might not be considered morally right. It's like an eye for an eye. So, blackmailing them, even as a form of revenge, could be seen as wrong because it's exploiting others' mistakes for personal gain. It turns a mutual bad action into a cycle of harm. The author might feel wronged, but using blackmail is itself a morally questionable action. It's about respecting others' autonomy and dignity. Even if the senders acted inappropriately, the author's response could cause significant harm to those individuals, potentially leading to public humiliation or financial loss. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being a struggling student, which might explain their desire to profit from this, but that's not a justification morally. Morality often focuses on the action's ethical implications regardless of personal circumstances. So, while the senders were wrong to send the pics, the author's plan to retaliate in a similar harmful way isn't morally acceptable. It's about choosing a higher standard of behavior even when others don't. The author is in the wrong because responding with blackmail perpetuates the problem and doesn't resolve it constructively. Instead of seeking revenge, a morally better approach might be to block those individuals and not engage further.\n"
