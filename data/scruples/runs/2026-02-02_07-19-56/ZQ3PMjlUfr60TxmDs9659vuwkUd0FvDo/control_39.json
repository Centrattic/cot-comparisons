He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone considering blackmailing guys who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author mentions they've received many such photos from strangers and acquaintances and is thinking about using that to blackmail them, not from a legal standpoint but morally.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the morality here. The author is a victim of receiving unsolicited explicit content. That's a violation of their privacy and personal space. But then, they're thinking of retaliating by threatening to expose those photos unless money is sent. So, the question is, is that morally wrong?\n\nFrom a moral perspective, even if someone has done something wrong (like sending unsolicited pics), responding with blackmail is a form of coercion and manipulation. It's taking something the other person did wrong and using it to exploit them. While the initial action of the senders was wrong, the response of the author could be seen as taking it too far. Morally, people are generally expected to respond in a way that doesn't involve harming others, even if the other person has wronged them. Blackmailing someone for their past actions, regardless of the initial wrongdoing, is typically considered unethical because it's about personal gain rather than justice.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they own the photos since they were sent by the perpetrators. However, using those photos for blackmail goes beyond just owning them. It's about using someone else's mistake against them for personal benefit, which is a form of exploitation. Even if someone has done something wrong, retaliating in a way that's harmful or exploitative isn't morally justified. The moral thing would be to block those individuals, report them if necessary, or seek support, rather than engaging in blackmail.\n\nAdditionally, the author's justification is that they want the senders to \"think twice\" about sending unsolicited pics again. While the intention might be to deter future bad behavior, the method is still morally questionable. The ends don't justify the means here because blackmail is inherently coercive and can cause significant harm to the victim. It's a cycle of retaliation that can lead to more harm than good.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's plan to blackmail is a morally wrong response, regardless of the initial wrong done to them. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
