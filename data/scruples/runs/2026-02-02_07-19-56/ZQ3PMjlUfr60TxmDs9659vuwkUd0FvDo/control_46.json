He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong, specifically about blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The user wants an answer A or B, where A is yes, the author is in the wrong, and B is no, they aren't.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited explicit photos. They mention that they already have a collection of these images, and they're thinking about using them to extort money from the senders. They clarify they're not asking about legal consequences but moral ones.\n\nNow, the key points here. The original posters sent unsolicited images, which is generally considered inappropriate and respectful as a red flag. However, the author's response is to take that inappropriate action and retaliate with blackmail. The question is about morality, not legality.\n\nMoral standpoint usually involves considering right and wrong based on one's ethics. Even though the senders acted inappropriately, does that justify the author's blackmail? Retaliation can sometimes be seen as an eye-for-an-eye approach. However, taking something bad (unsolicited pics) and then doing something equally bad or worse (blackmail) doesn't resolve the issue morally. It escalates the harm. \n\nAlso, the author is using the argument of \"they deserved it,\" but morally, does that hold up? Most ethical frameworks would say that responding to harm with further harm isn't the right approach. Even if someone acts wrongly, the appropriate response is to address it without committing wrongdoings yourself. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of justice versus revenge. Justice might involve holding someone accountable, but revenge is about inflicting harm. Blackmail is a form of extortion, which is inherently wrong regardless of the context. So even if the senders were at fault, the author's actions would still be morally wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions organizing a gallery, which is a humorous take but doesn't mitigate the moral issue. Using someone's private images without consent is a violation of their privacy, regardless of how the images were obtained. So sharing them for blackmail is a double violation.\n\nIn summary, even though the senders acted inappropriately, the author's plan to blackmail them is a moral wrong. The retaliation doesn't make their actions justified. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
