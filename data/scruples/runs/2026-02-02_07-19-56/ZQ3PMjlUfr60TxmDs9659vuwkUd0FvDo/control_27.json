He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong when considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key here is the moral standpoint, not legal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has received many unsolicited explicit images from strangers and people they know. They're thinking about using these images to blackmail the senders. They argue that since the senders sent the pics, the author \"owns\" them, but that's not a legal argument. The user is asking about morality.\n\nMorality-wise, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves coercion for personal gain. Even if the person being blackmailed did something wrong (like sending unsolicited pics), using that to extort money or other favors is unethical. The author is planning to exploit the mistakes of others, which is a form of manipulation. \n\nAlso, the senders might have acted inappropriately, but retaliating with blackmail doesn't resolve the issue ethically. Instead, it perpetuates harm. The author's justification that the senders \"deserve\" it because they sent the pics doesn't make the blackmail morally acceptable. It's similar to saying \"they started it,\" which isn't a valid excuse for wrongdoing.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position of power over the senders, and using that power for personal gain (money, etc.) is exploitative. Even if the author isn't a victim in the traditional sense, they are now threatening others, which is harmful. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author is in the wrong because blackmail is unethical, regardless of the context. The answer should be A.\n"
