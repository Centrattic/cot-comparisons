He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The answer needs to be A (Yes) or B (No), based on a moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author has received many unsolicited photos of penises from strangers and people they know. They're thinking about using these images to blackmail the senders for money, similar to the friend's situation they read about. The author mentions they're not concerned with legal repercussions, so the focus is purely on morality.\n\nMoral considerations here would involve concepts like consent, respect, and fairness. The key points are: \n\n1. The senders sent the photos without consent from the author to receive them. However, the author now has these images. The author is considering using them as leverage to demand money. \n\n2. The senders might have sent the images with the intention of sharing them, but likely without the expectation that they'd be used for blackmail. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, blackmail typically involves using threats to gain an advantage, which is generally considered unethical. Even if the author has \"legal ownership\" of the photos (though legally it might be a gray area), the act of threatening to expose someone's private content for personal gain is morally questionable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the senders initiated the unethical behavior by sending unsolicited explicit photos, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But blackmail as a response to unethical behavior doesn't necessarily make the retaliation ethical. The principle of \"two wrongs don't make a right\" applies here. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of proportionality. The senders might have acted inconsiderately, but the author's retaliation could cause significant harm to the victims, such as embarrassment, social repercussions, or financial loss. This disproportionate response could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions being a \"struggling college student,\" implying they might be in need of money. However, that doesn't justify blackmail. There are more ethical ways to address financial struggles.\n\nConsidering all these points, the consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong because blackmail is inherently unethical, regardless of the context. The fact that others acted poorly doesn't justify responding with the same harmful behavior. The author's plan to exploit the situation for personal gain crosses a moral line, making them the wrongdoer in this scenario.\n"
