He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The author is not asking about legal consequences, just the moral aspect.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation morally. The author has received many unsolicited explicit images from strangers and people they know. They want to retaliate by blackmailing these individuals, using the photos they have. The author argues that since the photos were sent to them, they technically own them.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the author isn't breaking the law, is their plan justified? Well, unsolicited explicit images are generally considered invasive and inappropriate. The people who sent them acted inconsiderately and possibly in a way that made the recipient uncomfortable. However, the author's response of blackmailing them introduces a cycle of harm. While the initial action (sending unsolicited pics) was wrong, responding with blackmail could be seen as taking justice into their own hands in a harmful way.\n\nMoral systems often consider the proportionality of a response. Retaliating with blackmail might be seen as excessive, even if the original act was wrong. It's about whether the ends justify the means. By blackmailing, the author is essentially victimizing the senders, which might not be morally acceptable regardless of the other person's fault. There's also the aspect of consent and privacy\u2014using the photos for blackmail violates the senders' privacy further and could cause emotional distress.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of \"do unto others.\" If the author would be upset if someone did this to them, then it's probably wrong. Since they received the images without consent, they can't ethically deny others the same privacy. Plus, blackmail is inherently coercive and manipulative, which is generally frowned upon morally.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author has the right to protect themselves and that the blackmail is a form of justice. But morally, it's about whether the action is right or wrong, not just about getting revenge. The author's intention to use the photos for personal gain (even if it's to teach a lesson) could be seen as exploiting others' mistakes, which is ethically questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the original actions of the senders were wrong, the author's plan to blackmail them would likely be considered morally wrong because it perpetuates harm and uses coercion, which isn't an ethical response regardless of the provocation.\n"
