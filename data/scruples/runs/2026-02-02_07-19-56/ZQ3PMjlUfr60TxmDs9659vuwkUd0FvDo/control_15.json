He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key points here are the moral aspect, not legal. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they've received many unsolicited photos from strangers and people they know. They want to take advantage of these photos by blackmailing the senders. The moral question is whether this is justified.\n\nWell, even though the author might feel that the senders are at fault for sending the pics, using that as a reason to blackmail them seems like a form of revenge. Morality often considers intent and proportionality. The senders might have acted inconsiderately, but blackmailing them could cause harm and isn't a proportional response. It's also about respecting others' privacy and autonomy, even if they've violated your own. \n\nEven if the author believes they have a right to the photos, using them for blackmail is exploiting the situation for personal gain. That's generally seen as unethical because it perpetuates harm. The situation where someone sends a photo they don't want you to have doesn't give you the right to use it maliciously. So, morally, the author would be in the wrong for planning to blackmail them, regardless of the senders' actions. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n"
