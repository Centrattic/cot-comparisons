He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key points here are the moral aspect, not legal. \n\nFirst, the author has been receiving these unwanted photos from strangers and people they know. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders by making them go viral unless they pay money. They mention they're a struggling college student, so maybe there's a financial motivation.\n\nMorally, even if legally it's a different story, we have to consider the ethics. The senders sent the photos voluntarily, possibly without consent to have them used in this way. The author is taking something that was given without permission and flipping it into a form of coercion. \n\nEven though the senders might be at fault for sending unsolicited content, using that content to extort them could be seen as a moral wrong. The author is exploiting the senders' mistake for personal gain, which is a form of harm. The humor in the initial part about their friend's situation might downplay the seriousness of the situation, but morally, blackmail is generally considered wrong regardless of the context. \n\nSo, even though the author might feel justified, the act of blackmail involves threatening to expose something to get money or other benefits, which is ethically problematic. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
