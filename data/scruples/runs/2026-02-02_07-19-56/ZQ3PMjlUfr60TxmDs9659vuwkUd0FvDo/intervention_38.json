He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong morally. The author received unsolicited dick pics from strangers and people they know, and they're considering blackmailing those people for money by threatening to share the photos. They mention they're not asking about legal repercussions but moral ones.\n\nFirst, I need to think about moral implications. The key points here are consent, respect, and reciprocity. The author is being sent unsolicited images, which is definitely a privacy violation. But when they consider blackmail, that flips the script. Even though the senders might be at fault for sending without consent, the author's response could also be seen as taking advantage of that situation.\n\nMoral frameworks often emphasize treating others as you'd want to be treated. If the author were to blackmail someone, they'd be using the same tactics as the senders, which could perpetuate a cycle of abuse. It might not be legal, but morally, is it justified? Some might argue that it's a form of poetic justice, but others would say that it's wrong because it's still coercion and harm, regardless of the victim's initial mistake.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"owning\" the photos is a legal point, but morally, does that give the author the right to exploit them? Even if the senders sent the photos voluntarily, the act of sending doesn't relinquish their right to privacy. The author's threat to share them for money is a form of exploitation, which is generally considered immoral.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author mentions they find the original blackmail situation hilarious, but their own plan is to profit from the photos. This could be seen as hypocritical, especially if they're criticizing the other person's actions while planning to do the same. It's like saying, \"I'm a bad guy, but I'm justified because they were worse.\"\n\nAdditionally, there's the impact on others. If the author proceeds with blackmail, it could cause significant distress to the victims, even if they initially made a mistake. The psychological harm might outweigh the initial wrongdoing, making the author's actions morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong. They're using a morally questionable method to retaliate, which can cause harm and doesn't resolve the underlying issue of the senders' behavior. It's a cycle of negative actions rather than a constructive response.\n"
