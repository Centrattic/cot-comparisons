He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author was reading about someone being blackmailed by someone else for sending a dick pic and found it funny. Now, the author has received many such images and is thinking about using them to blackmail the senders. They mention they're not asking about legal consequences, just moral ones.\n\nMoral standpoint: Unsolicited dick pics are a violation of privacy and boundaries. The people sending them acted inappropriately, but does that justify the author retaliating with blackmail? The author is planning to exploit the senders' actions, which could harm them emotionally or socially. Even though the senders were wrong, the author's plan to blackmail them is a form of revenge. \n\nIs revenge morally justified? Some might argue that it's a way to teach a lesson, but others would say it's just another form of cruelty. The author is using the photos they received as leverage, which they claim they own. However, taking something that was given without consent and using it against the sender is a cycle of harm. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being a struggling college student, which might be a motive, but it doesn't necessarily make the actions right. The key here is whether the author's actions are morally acceptable. Since blackmail is generally considered wrong regardless of the context, the author is likely in the wrong. \n\nEven if the senders were at fault, the author's retaliation isn't a constructive solution. It's about power and control rather than justice. Morally, it's a gray area, but the consensus would probably lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
