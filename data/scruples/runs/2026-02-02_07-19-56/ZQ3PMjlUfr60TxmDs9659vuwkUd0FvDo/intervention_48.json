He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who has received many unsolicited dick pics and is considering blackmailing the senders as revenge. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author is thinking of using the photos they received to blackmail others, similar to how they saw a friend being blackmailed. Even though they mention they're not asking for legal advice, the moral aspect is key here.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is taking something that was sent to them without consent and using it to extort money. Even if the senders were at fault for sending unsolicited images, does that justify the author's actions? Probably not. The author is using the same method as the blackmailer in the story they found funny. That seems hypocritical because they laughed at the friend's situation but are considering doing the same thing. \n\nAlso, the author is taking advantage of others' mistakes to gain something for themselves, which is a form of exploitation. Even though the senders were wrong, the author's response is to exploit that wrongdoing rather than ignore or report it. This creates a cycle where people might feel justified in their own harmful actions. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author's goal is to get money by threatening to expose the senders. This is a form of coercion, which is morally wrong regardless of the other person's initial mistake. The fact that the author is doing this for personal gain, especially as a \"struggling college student,\" doesn't mitigate the wrongness of blackmail. \n\nThere's also the issue of consent. The photos were sent without the author's consent, but using them for blackmail is another violation. The author is using something that was given to them inappropriately to further harm others. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is taking an immoral action in response to an immoral act, which doesn't make their action right. They are creating a harmful situation where people might face public humiliation if they don't pay up. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
