He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about morality, not legality. The author is considering blackmailing men who sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mention that they have a lot of these photos and are thinking of using them to get money from the senders.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author is retaliating against people who sent inappropriate photos without consent. Those people might have done something creepy or invasive, so the author's reaction is a form of revenge. But is revenge morally justified?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say that the author is taking justice into their own hands. The senders violated the author's privacy by sending unsolicited images. However, blackmail is also a violation, so the author is using the same unethical method to get revenge. Even if the senders were wrong, does that make the author right to do the same?\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author isn't doing this for malicious reasons, maybe to teach a lesson or get compensation, but blackmail is generally seen as wrong because it coerces someone into giving money or something else. Even if the victim is in the wrong, using blackmail could be seen as perpetuating a cycle of harm.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they technically own the photos since they were sent to them. But ownership doesn't necessarily equate to moral right to use them. Even if they have the photos, using them for blackmail could be considered exploiting the situation for personal gain, which might be seen as selfish or unethical.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using the situation to take advantage of others' mistakes. While the senders made a poor choice, the author's response could be seen as taking unfair advantage, which is morally questionable. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and exploiting others' missteps for personal benefit.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is holding the senders accountable for their actions. If the senders knew there would be consequences, they might think twice before sending more photos. But again, accountability doesn't justify illegal or unethical methods. The author is choosing a method that's as harmful as the original action, which complicates the moral judgment.\n\nIn summary, while the senders are at fault for sending unsolicited images, the author's plan to blackmail them is a form of retaliation that uses similar unethical tactics. Morally, this could be seen as the author being in the wrong because they are using coercion and exploiting the situation for personal gain, regardless of the initial wrongdoing of the others.\n"
