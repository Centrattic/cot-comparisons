He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key points here are the moral aspect, not legal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author received many unsolicited explicit photos from strangers and people they know. They're thinking about retaliating by blackmailing these senders, using the photos as leverage. They mention they're not asking about legality but morality.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is this right? Well, unsolicited explicit images are a violation of privacy, but the author is now planning to use those images to blackmail others. Blackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves threatening to expose someone's secrets unless they comply with demands. Even if the initial action (sending the pics) was wrong, using it for blackmail seems like taking revenge in a harmful way. \n\nBut then again, the senders initiated the problem by sending unsolicited content. The author might feel justified, but morality isn't about revenge. It's about doing what's right regardless of past actions. So, blackmailing them would be exploiting the situation for personal gain, which is unethical. Also, the author is using the photos to cause harm or financial loss, which isn't fair. Even though the senders were wrong, the response should be proportionate and non-harmful. \n\nAnother angle: the author owns the photos, they say. But taking photos someone sent you and using them against them is still a form of coercion. It's not just about ownership but how you use what you have. Morality would suggest that instead of blackmailing, they should report or ignore such messages. Using blackmail turns a bad situation into a worse one, perpetuating harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong morally because they're choosing to retaliate in a harmful way instead of addressing the issue through ethical means. Even if the senders were wrong, the author's plan isn't the right moral choice.\n"
