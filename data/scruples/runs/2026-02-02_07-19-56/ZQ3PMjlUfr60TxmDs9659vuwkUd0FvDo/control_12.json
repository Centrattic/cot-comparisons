He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong from a moral standpoint. The author is considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mention that they've received many such photos from strangers and people they know in real life. The author is thinking about using these photos to extort money, similar to the situation the friend was in.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the morality here. The author is retaliating against those who sent unsolicited explicit content. The key points are consent and harm. The people sending the pics did so without the author's consent, which is definitely a violation. However, the author's response is to blackmail those individuals, which also involves a form of coercion and harm.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, even if someone has been wronged, is revenge or retaliation morally justifiable? The author argues that the recipients of the blackmail are the ones who initially acted inappropriately. But does that give the author the right to reciprocate in a harmful way? \n\nIt's a classic case of an eye for an eye, which can lead to escalating cycles of harm. Morally, many ethical frameworks would suggest that while the initial act was wrong, responding with further harm isn't necessarily justified. The author's actions could be considered a form of vigilantism, which isn't typically seen as morally acceptable, even if the original action was wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the author is considering using the photos to extort money, which can cause significant distress and financial harm to the victims. Even if the victims are at fault for sending the photos, the author's blackmail could have serious consequences for them. This creates a situation where the author is causing harm to others, which is ethically problematic regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author's motivation is to teach others a lesson, but this intent doesn't necessarily make the action right. There's a difference between seeking justice and seeking revenge. Justice might involve reporting the harassment or blocking the individuals, whereas blackmail is a more severe and unethical response.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on the victims of the blackmail, the author could be causing emotional and financial distress. Even if the victims were wrong in sending the photos, the author's actions could lead to unintended consequences, such as someone losing their job or facing public humiliation beyond their initial mistake.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is choosing to take matters into their own hands instead of addressing the issue through appropriate channels (like blocking the senders, reporting harassment, or not engaging at all). Their response could be seen as taking part in a harmful cycle rather than breaking it.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is simply responding to harassment in a way that deters future inappropriate behavior. But from a moral standpoint, that's a questionable justification. It's similar to saying that if someone attacks you, you're allowed to attack them back, even if it causes more harm. Most ethical systems would discourage this as it perpetuates a cycle of harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the initial act of sending unsolicited explicit content is morally wrong, the author's response of blackmail is also morally wrong. The author is using unethical means to address a problem, which doesn't align with moral principles that emphasize non-coercion and minimizing harm. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
