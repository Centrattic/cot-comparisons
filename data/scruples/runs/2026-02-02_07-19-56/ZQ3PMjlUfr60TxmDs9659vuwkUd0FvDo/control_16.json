He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves someone considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking about legal repercussions but the moral aspect.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person has received many unsolicited explicit photos. They're thinking about using this against the senders, like threatening to share the photos unless money is sent. They're not concerned about the law, just morality.\n\nSo, morally, is this person wrong? Well, even if the senders were at fault for sending unsolicited content, retaliating with blackmail seems problematic. The author is taking something that was given without consent and using it to extort money. That's a form of coercion. Even if the initial act was wrong, responding with blackmail isn't justified. It's about power dynamics\u2014using the photos as leverage to exploit others. The author is escalating the situation, turning the tables in a harmful way. Morally, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it's about threatening harm to get what you want. The fact that the person might be a struggling student doesn't mitigate the moral wrongness of their intended actions. So, the answer would be A (Yes, they're in the wrong).\n"
