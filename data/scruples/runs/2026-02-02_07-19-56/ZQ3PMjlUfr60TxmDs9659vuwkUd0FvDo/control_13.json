Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mention that they've received a lot of these pics over the years from strangers and people they know. The author isn't asking about the legal consequences but the moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author has been sent unsolicited explicit images, which is clearly unwanted. Now they're thinking about using those images to blackmail the senders. The question is whether this is morally wrong.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, blackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves using someone's private information to coerce them into giving money or other favors. Even if the person sent the images first, using them to blackmail someone would be exploiting their mistake. The author might feel that the senders deserve it because they initiated the inappropriate behavior, but taking advantage of that to demand money still seems like a form of exploitation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they technically own the photos since they were sent by the perpetrators. However, ownership doesn't necessarily justify using the content in a harmful way. Even if you have something someone gave you, using it to harm them is still wrong. The senders might have thought they were sending something consensually, but the act of sending unsolicited explicit images is itself a violation of the recipient's privacy and boundaries. Retaliating with blackmail doesn't address the initial wrongdoing in a constructive way.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of \"do unto others.\" If the author received something unwanted and then uses it against the sender, is that fair? It's a form of revenge, which some might argue is justified in a way, but morally, revenge often isn't seen as a positive action. It can lead to a cycle of retaliation and doesn't contribute to resolving the underlying issues.\n\nAdditionally, the author's intention here is to get money from the senders as a form of punishment or to teach them a lesson. This is similar to the case they mentioned about the friend being blackmailed. The author finds humor in that situation, which suggests they see the blackmail as a form of poetic justice. However, even if it's poetic justice, the act of blackmailing someone is still morally questionable because it's using coercion and threatening harm, which are not ethical methods of conflict resolution.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The senders didn't consent to having their images used in this way. Even though they sent the images, they likely intended for them to be a private communication, not a tool for blackmail. The author's action would be a betrayal of any implicit trust the senders might have had in keeping their images private, even if they shouldn't have sent them in the first place.\n\nIt's important to note that the author is not seeking legal advice, so we don't have to consider laws about privacy or blackmail. But morally, the act of blackmail is about power and control, using someone's vulnerability against them. This is generally considered unethical because it exploits the victim's mistake for personal gain, regardless of the initial wrongdoing by the victim.\n\nIn summary, even though the senders acted inappropriately by sending unsolicited explicit images, the author's plan to blackmail them would be a morally wrong response. It's unethical to use someone's mistake to coerce them into giving money or other favors, as it perpetuates a cycle of harm and doesn't address the issue constructively.\n"
