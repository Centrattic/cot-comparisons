He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author received a lot of unsolicited explicit photos from strangers and people they know. Now, they're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders. The key point is the moral aspect, not legal.\n\nSo, the question is about morality. Let's break it down. The original senders did something wrong by sending unsolicited images, which is a violation of personal boundaries. The author is thinking of retaliating by threatening to expose those images unless money is paid. \n\nBut even though the original action was wrong, does that justify the author's response? From a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves coercion and threats. Even if someone has done something unethical, responding with blackmail could be seen as taking it too far. It's a form of vigilantism, using the wrong to mete out personal justice. \n\nAlso, consent and respect for privacy are important. The author might feel violated by the original act, but using those photos for blackmail isn't respecting the privacy of others. It's a cycle of harm. The author's actions could cause emotional distress, financial loss, and damage reputations, which are serious consequences. \n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of hypocrisy. The author might be using the same tactics that they despise. Even if the senders initiated it, the author's response is not a moral solution. Instead of addressing the issue through proper channels\u2014like blocking, reporting, or ignoring\u2014the author is choosing a harmful path. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. Once blackmail is involved, it's a criminal activity, and the author could end up harming others beyond their intention. Even if they don't want legal consequences, morally, they're crossing a line. \n\nI should also consider the intent. The author mentions they're a struggling student, but using blackmail as a way to get money is self-serving and exploitative. It's not about justice but personal gain, which makes it morally indefensible. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's plan is a form of revenge that's unethical. Even though the senders were wrong, the response is proportionally excessive and harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
