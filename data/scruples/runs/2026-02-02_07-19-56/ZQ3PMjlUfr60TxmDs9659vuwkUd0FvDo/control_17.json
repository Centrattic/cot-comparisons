He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author is not asking about legal consequences, just moral.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author has received a lot of these pics from strangers and even people they know. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders by threatening to share them unless the senders give money. The author mentions that they technically own the photos since they were sent by the perpetrators. But they're asking if this is morally wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The original senders were the ones who acted inappropriately by sending unsolicited images. However, the author's response is to retaliate in kind. Even though the senders made a mistake, the author's plan involves using blackmail, which is generally considered unethical. Blackmail, regardless of the initial wrongdoing, involves coercion and can cause harm. The author is taking something that was given without consent (the photos) and then using them to extort money. \n\nEven if the author feels wronged, the response of blackmail could be seen as taking justice into their own hands in a harmful way. Morally, most people would argue that responding with similar unethical behavior doesn't make it right. It's about proportionality and the method used. The author could have other ways to address the issue, like ignoring or blocking, but choosing to blackmail escalates the problem. \n\nAlso, the photos were sent without consent, so the author holding onto them and using them for blackmail is problematic. The initial act of sharing the images was wrong, but using them to threaten others might not be justified morally. The ends don't justify the means here. The author is causing harm to others, even if those others were at fault first. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they're choosing a morally wrong method to address the issue, even if the senders were wrong. The response is harmful and unethical, regardless of the provocation.\n"
