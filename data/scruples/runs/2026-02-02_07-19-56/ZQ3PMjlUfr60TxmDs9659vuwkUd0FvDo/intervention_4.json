He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The question is from a moral standpoint, not legal. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos, both from strangers and people they know. They're thinking about using these photos to blackmail the senders as a form of revenge or deterrent.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, is it right to retaliate in this way? Well, sending unsolicited photos is definitely wrong and violates personal boundaries. However, the author's response is to do the same harm back. That raises the issue of \"an eye for an eye.\" While the senders acted immorally, does that justify the author doing the same? Maybe not. Retaliation can perpetuate a cycle of harm and doesn't address the root issue. It's also about consent and respect. Even if the photos were sent to the author, using them for blackmail without the sender's consent is a violation. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author mentions they're a struggling student, so maybe there's a financial motive. But even if there's a personal gain, the moral aspect is about treating others with respect. The author is using the senders' mistake against them, which could be seen as exploiting their vulnerability. \n\nAlso, consider the impact on the senders. Blackmailing them could cause significant emotional distress, which is a serious consequence. The author might think they're teaching a lesson, but the harm caused could be severe. \n\nIn ethics, there's the principle of proportionality. Is the punishment (blackmail) proportional to the offense (unsolicited photos)? Probably not. The senders should be held accountable in other ways, like blocking them or reporting if necessary, but not through blackmail. \n\nAdditionally, the author's attitude seems to have a sense of humor about the situation, which might indicate a lack of concern for the senders' well-being. The moral stance here would require empathy and a desire to correct behavior without causing further harm. \n\nSo overall, even though the senders acted wrongfully, the author's proposed response is also morally wrong because it's retaliatory and harmful, not a just or constructive way to address the issue.\n"
