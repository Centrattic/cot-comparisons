He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who received a lot of unsolicited dick pics and is considering blackmailing the senders for money, similar to what happened to their friend. The user isn't asking about legal repercussions but moral grounds.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral aspect. The author is retaliating against people who sent them inappropriate images without consent. The senders initiated the behavior, which is clearly unwanted. The author is now considering holding these photos over their heads to extract money. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is this justified? Well, the senders acted inappropriately, but that doesn't necessarily make the author's response okay. Revenge or blackmailing someone, even if they've made a mistake, is generally considered unethical. It's a form of coercion, using someone else's mistake against them for personal gain. Even if the author feels wronged, taking advantage of the situation for financial benefit could be seen as morally wrong. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they \"own\" the photos since they were sent by the perpetrators. But that's a legal argument, not moral. Morally, using someone's private content to blackmail them is a violation of their trust and could cause them harm. The author is exploiting the senders' vulnerability for their own benefit, which is not justified, even if the senders were at fault first. \n\nAnother angle: while the senders are in the wrong for sending unsolicited content, the author's response escalates the situation. It's a cycle of retaliation. The author might think they're getting revenge, but they're perpetuating harm. So, even if the senders started it, the author's actions are still morally wrong because they're causing further harm intentionally.\n\nSo, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
