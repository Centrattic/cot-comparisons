He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong when considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The user wants a yes or no answer based on moral grounds, not legal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is considering blackmailing people who sent them explicit images without consent. The person is a college student and is thinking about using the photos to extract money from the senders. They mention they already have a collection from various people, both strangers and people they know in real life. They clarify they're not asking about legal repercussions but the moral aspect.\n\nSo, the core of the question is whether it's morally wrong to retaliate against people who have sent unsolicited explicit images by blackmailing them. Let me break this down. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves threatening to expose information unless demands are met. Even if the person being blackmailed did something wrong (like sending unsolicited images), using that as a reason to blackmail them can be seen as taking advantage of their mistake for personal gain. \n\nThe key points here are consent and exploitation. The original act of sending unsolicited images is a violation of the recipient's consent, which is already problematic. However, retaliating with blackmail could be seen as using that violation to extort money, which might perpetuate a cycle of harm. Even though the sender initiated the inappropriate action, the recipient's response could be morally questionable because it's about coercion and gaining money through threats.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of justice versus revenge. If the author's goal is to teach a lesson, it's important to consider whether blackmail is a just response. Moral theories like deontology (which focuses on duties and rules) might argue that blackmail is inherently wrong regardless of the situation. Utilitarianism (which considers consequences) might evaluate if the outcome is a net positive. However, blackmail can lead to negative outcomes for all parties involved, including stress, financial loss, and potential escalation.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of power dynamics. The author is in a position to expose the sender, which they didn't consent to sharing. Using that power to extort money could be seen as exploiting the sender's mistake, which might not be morally justifiable even if the sender was at fault first.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is simply using a form of justified retaliation. Since the sender violated the author's boundaries, the author could feel they are taking back control. But morally, retaliation doesn't necessarily make the action right. Society generally discourages vigilantism and encourages addressing issues through appropriate channels, not personal revenge.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions they are a struggling student. Their motivation might be financial, which adds another layer. Using blackmail for personal gain rather than to correct the sender's behavior could be seen as selfish and unethical.\n\nIn summary, while the original act of sending unsolicited images is wrong, the author's response of blackmailing the senders is likely considered morally wrong because it involves coercion, exploitation, and taking advantage of the initial violation for personal benefit. The moral argument against blackmail is strong here, regardless of the sender's actions.\n"
