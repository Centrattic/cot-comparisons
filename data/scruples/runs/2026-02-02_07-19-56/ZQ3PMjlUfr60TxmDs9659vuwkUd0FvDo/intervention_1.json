He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who has received many unsolicited dick pics and is considering blackmailing the senders. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is contemplating using the photos to blackmail people who sent them unsolicited. They argue they technically own the photos because they were sent by the other person. The question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal.\n\nMoral standpoint: Even if legally possible, is it morally right to blackmail someone? Blackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves coercion and threatening to expose someone's private information for personal gain. The author is using the photos as a form of retaliation or punishment for the senders' actions. However, using someone else's private content without consent, regardless of how they were obtained, is a violation of their privacy and trust.\n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. The senders of the photos did so without the author's consent, but the author is now using that violation to further harm them. It's a cycle of exploitation. Even if the author feels wronged or wants to teach a lesson, the act of blackmailing is a form of abuse of power. The author is taking advantage of a mistake made by others to gain some form of compensation or satisfaction, which isn't justifiable morally.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that they \"technically own\" the photos is flawed. Just because someone sends you something doesn't mean you have the right to use it against them. Ownership in a legal sense is one thing, but moral ownership is different. The author's actions would harm the other person's dignity and privacy, which is a moral issue.\n\nIn terms of the original question, the author is planning to blackmail others for their own gain, which is a clear moral wrong. Even if they are retaliating against unsolicited content, the means of response are unethical. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
