He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong if they decide to blackmail people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key here is the moral standpoint, not legal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the people sending the pics. They're acting inappropriately and without consent by sending unsolicited explicit images. That's generally considered wrong, so maybe the author is justified in some way. But then, the author is planning to use that against them, which is blackmail. Even if the other party is at fault, does that make the author's retaliation moral?\n\nMoral frameworks often emphasize not doing harm, even to those who have wronged you. Retaliation can create a cycle of harm. Even if the sender is in the wrong, the author's threat to expose or ask for money could cause significant distress. Also, the author's intent is to teach a lesson, but blackmail is inherently coercive and unethical. It's about using someone else's mistake to gain something, which isn't right regardless of the situation. \n\nAnother angle: the author claims to own the photos because they were sent to them. Legally, ownership might be different, but morally, even if you have the photos, threatening to share them unless money is paid is wrong. It's exploiting someone's vulnerability, which is a moral issue. \n\nSo, even though the senders are at fault, the author's plan crosses into unethical territory. The idea of \"taking advantage\" by blackmailing them isn't justified morally because it's a harmful and manipulative act. Therefore, the author is in the wrong from a moral standpoint.\n"
