He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is talking about revenge against people who sent unsolicited explicit photos. They mention they have a collection from various sources. They\u2019re not asking about the legal side, just the moral aspect. \n\nMoral questions can be tricky because they depend on societal norms and personal ethics. From a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves threatening to expose private information unless demands are met. Even if the person being blackmailed did something questionable (like sending unsolicited pics), using blackmail as a response is usually seen as unethical. \n\nThe author argues that since the photos were sent to them, they \"own\" them. However, just because someone sends you something doesn't mean it's morally acceptable to use it against them. The original act of sending unsolicited explicit content is inappropriate, but retaliating with blackmail isn't a morally justified response. It escalates the harm and exploits the initial wrongdoing for personal gain, which is typically frowned upon. \n\nAdditionally, the author finds humor in the idea that someone else might be blackmailed for sending such photos, implying a kind of \"what goes around comes around\" mentality. But morally, even if someone deserves it for their actions, taking revenge can perpetuate a cycle of negativity and doesn't resolve the underlying issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. Their plan to blackmail others for the sake of revenge, regardless of the initial wrongdoing, crosses into unethical territory. The moral stance would generally oppose such retaliation, even if the original action was also wrong.\n"
