He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking about legal consequences but moral ones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author has received these photos, which are unsolicited and presumably made the author uncomfortable. Now, they're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders. The key here is whether the threat to expose these photos is justified as a form of punishment or retribution.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally seen as unethical because it involves coercion and threats. Even if the person being blackmailed did something wrong (like sending unsolicited explicit photos), threatening to expose that wrongdoing for personal gain (like money) is usually considered immoral. The author is holding the senders' past actions over their heads for leverage, which is a form of extortion. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the senders initiated the problem by sending the photos without consent. The author could feel that they're getting their comeuppance by using the photos to teach the senders a lesson. But even in that case, the act of blackmailing them isn't a fair or moral response. It's a form of revenge, which can be morally questionable as it perpetuates a cycle of harm.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that they \"own\" the photos since they were sent by the perpetrators. But just because someone receives something doesn't mean they have the moral right to misuse it. The photos were sent without consent, so the author's right to use them is dubious. Using them for blackmail would be an abuse of the situation, regardless of ownership.\n\nAlso, considering the intent. The author finds humor in someone else's misfortune (the friend being blackmailed) and is considering doing the same. This suggests a willingness to cause distress for personal satisfaction or gain, which is morally problematic. It's not about correcting a wrong but taking pleasure in others' discomfort.\n\nIn summary, while the senders acted inappropriately by sending unsolicited photos, the author's plan to blackmail them as a form of punishment or to get money is a form of coercion that's ethically wrong. The author's actions would be seen as taking advantage of others' mistakes for personal benefit, which is not morally acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
