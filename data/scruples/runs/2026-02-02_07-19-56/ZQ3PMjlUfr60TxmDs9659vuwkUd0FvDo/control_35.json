He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent unsolicited dick pics. The author mentions they've received many such photos and wants to take advantage by blackmailing them, not from a legal but a moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. Unsolicited explicit images are generally seen as violating privacy and consent. The sender isn't supposed to share those photos, and the recipient is now thinking of retaliating. Even though the author isn't asking about legality, morality here is about right and wrong actions.\n\nBlackmail is inherently coercive. The author is planning to use the photos to extort money or favors, which is harmful. Even if the sender sent the photos first, that doesn't justify the recipient doing the same. Retaliation with blackmail perpetuates a cycle of harm and exploitation. Morally, respecting others' privacy and dignity is important. Using someone else's mistake to harm them isn't justified. It's about whether the ends justify the means. The author's action would cause distress and violate the senders' rights, regardless of the initial wrongdoing. So, morally, the author is in the wrong because blackmail is unethical regardless of the context.\n"
