He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The key points here are the moral implications, as the author explicitly states they're not asking about legal consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos, which is a form of harassment. They're thinking about using these photos to blackmail the senders, similar to how the friend was blackmailed. The author's reasoning is that the senders should face the same treatment they subjected the author to, essentially an eye for an eye.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, revenge or reciprocal harm isn't typically seen as justified, even if the original act was harmful. The senders of the pics are acting inappropriately, but retaliating with blackmail introduces a different set of issues. Blackmail is a form of coercion and exploitation, which is generally considered unethical regardless of the context. Even if the photos are technically in the author's possession, using them to extort money or other favors turns the tables in a way that could cause significant harm to the victims.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of doing good despite wrongdoing. Some ethical frameworks, like certain interpretations of Christian teachings or Buddhist principles, advocate for forgiveness and non-retaliation. By choosing not to retaliate, the author might elevate their moral standing. However, others might argue that it's human nature to want justice or retribution, but acting on it can perpetuate a cycle of harm.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of intent. The author isn't seeking to expose the senders publicly or report them, but instead to exploit the situation for personal gain. This shifts the dynamic from self-defense to active malice, which complicates the moral judgment. While the senders are at fault for their initial transgression, the author's response introduces a level of cruelty and manipulation that's hard to justify morally.\n\nIt's important to note that the author is aware of the legal repercussions but is focusing on the moral aspect. Legally, blackmail is a crime, but morality isn't bound by law. However, moral judgments often consider societal norms and ethical standards. Coercion for personal benefit, even as revenge, is generally frowned upon. It's about the rightness of the action itself, not just the legality.\n\nIn summary, while the senders of the unsolicited photos are clearly in the wrong, the author's plan to blackmail them would also be morally wrong. The action exploits the victims' mistakes for the author's advantage, which doesn't align with ethical principles that prioritize compassion, forgiveness, and the avoidance of harm, even when seeking retribution.\n"
