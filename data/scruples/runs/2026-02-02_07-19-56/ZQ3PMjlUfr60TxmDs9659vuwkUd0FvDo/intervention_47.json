He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong when considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking about legality but morality.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos from strangers and people they know. They're considering using these photos to blackmail the senders, maybe as revenge or to teach them a lesson. The key here is the moral aspect.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves using someone's secrets or compromising information to gain an advantage or cause harm. Even if the person being blackmailed did something questionable (like sending unsolicited pics), using that information to extort money or something else is unethical. It's about respecting others' privacy and autonomy, even if they've violated your privacy first.\n\nThe author argues they \"own\" the photos since they were sent to them, but that doesn't justify misuse. Just because someone gives you something doesn't mean you can do anything with it. There's a difference between having the legal right to possess something and the moral right to use it maliciously.\n\nAlso, the author is considering this as a form of justice or deterrence. They want others to think twice before sending such pics. But revenge or punishment isn't a morally sound justification for blackmail. The ethical approach would be to report or block the senders, not retaliate in a harmful way.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions could cause significant harm to the victims, like embarrassment, social repercussions, or even mental distress. Even if the senders were in the wrong initially, the author's response escalates the situation in a harmful manner. Morality often emphasizes minimizing harm, not inflicting it, even as retribution.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's plan to blackmail others for sending unsolicited content is morally wrong. It crosses the line from a victim seeking justice to a perpetrator engaging in unethical behavior.\n"
