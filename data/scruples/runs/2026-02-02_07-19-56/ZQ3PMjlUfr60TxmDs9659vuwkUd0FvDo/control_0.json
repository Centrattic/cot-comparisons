He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong morally for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics. They mentioned they aren't asking about legal repercussions, just the moral aspect.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author received a lot of unsolicited explicit photos from strangers and people they know. They\u2019re thinking about retaliating by blackmailing these individuals using the photos they received. The question is whether this is morally wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: unsolicited content, revenge, and blackmail. The author feels wronged because people sent them explicit images without consent. Now they want to use those same images against the senders for money or other demands. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if it's not illegal, is it ethical? Well, blackmail is generally considered unethical because it involves threatening to expose something to gain an advantage. Even if the photos were sent without the author's consent, using them to blackmail someone would be exploiting their mistake. \n\nThe senders did something wrong by sharing unsolicited content, but does that justify the author doing the same? Retaliation can lead to a cycle of harm. The author is taking something that was done to them and using it as a weapon. But morally, does that make them the asshole? It might because they're perpetuating harm. Even if they feel wronged, responding with blackmail could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they're a struggling college student, which might imply they're doing this out of financial need. But that doesn't make the action right. The end doesn't justify the means in moral terms here. \n\nAnother angle is consent. The photos were sent without the author's consent, but using them to blackmail also violates the senders' privacy. So while the senders violated the author's privacy, the author's action does the same. It's a cycle of violation. \n\nThere's also the aspect of intent. The author might be trying to teach a lesson or get revenge. However, blackmail is a form of coercion, which is generally considered immoral. Even if the victim is someone who made a mistake, coercing them for money is wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the senders were in the wrong initially, the author's plan to retaliate with blackmail would be morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
