He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing people who sent them unsolicited dick pics.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author received a lot of unwanted explicit photos from strangers and even some people they know. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders, making them send money or face the pics going public. They mention they're not asking about legal consequences, just morality.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, what's the right thing here? The people sending the pics without consent are clearly the ones at fault. They violated the author's privacy and sent something unwanted. But does the author have the moral right to retaliate? \n\nOn one hand, revenge might feel justified because the senders acted inconsiderately. However, blackmail is inherently unethical because it uses threats to manipulate someone into giving money. Even if the victim is the one being blackmailed, using their own wrongdoing as a weapon can perpetuate a cycle of harm. Also, the author could be causing emotional distress to the senders, which isn't right regardless of the initial offense.\n\nAnother angle: the author argues they \"own\" the photos since they were sent. But just because someone sends you something doesn't mean you have the right to exploit it. Privacy and consent are two-way streets. Even if the sender broke the rules, the recipient shouldn't do the same. \n\nAlso, considering the impact. If the author proceeds, they might be harming others, even if those others are at fault. Morality isn't just about punishing wrongdoing; it's about behaving ethically regardless. So blackmail, regardless of the context, is a form of coercion and isn't morally acceptable. \n\nSo even though the senders are wrong, the author's plan is still wrong. The right moral choice would be to report the behavior, delete the photos, and not retaliate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
