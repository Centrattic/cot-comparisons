He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl. Enough to organize a phallus gallery at the drop of a hat. Being a struggling college student, would I be the asshole if I tried to take advantage of this now ? Technically I own the photos since they were sent to me by the perpetrator.\n\nBtw, I'm not asking from a legal stand point, I'm asking from a moral stand point; so please don't flood this with legal advice because I'm already aware of the repercussions. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering blackmailing guys who sent them unsolicited dick pics. The author isn't asking about legal consequences, just the moral standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has received many unsolicited explicit photos from strangers and people they know. They're thinking about using those photos to blackmail the senders, similar to the situation described in the post they read. The author mentions they're a struggling college student, so maybe they're considering this as a way to get money.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, blackmail is generally considered wrong because it involves threatening to expose someone's secrets unless they comply with demands. Even if the person being blackmailed did something wrong (like sending unsolicited photos), using that as leverage for personal gain is unethical. It's about exploiting someone else's mistake for your benefit, which isn't right. \n\nAlso, the author might think they \"own\" the photos since they were sent to them, but that doesn't justify blackmail. The intent here is to punish or get money from the senders, which is harmful. Even if the senders acted inappropriately, the author's response could cause emotional distress or other negative consequences for the victims. \n\nMoreover, the author is using humor about the situation, but blackmail isn't a joke. It's a serious action that can lead to significant harm. The fact that they find the situation funny suggests they might not fully consider the moral implications of their potential actions. \n\nIn terms of morality, most ethical frameworks would argue against blackmail because it's about power and control over others, not about justice. The right approach would be to block the senders and ignore the messages rather than retaliate in a harmful way. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's plan to blackmail the senders is morally wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
