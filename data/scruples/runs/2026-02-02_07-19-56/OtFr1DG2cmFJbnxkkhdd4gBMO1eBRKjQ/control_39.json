Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has body odor, the teacher tried to contact the mom who said they can bathe but he doesn't. The teacher then told the student directly that it's hard to seat him because people don't want to sit next to him, and advised him to clean himself daily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intent. They wanted to be discreet and help the student. The mom was already informed, so maybe the teacher felt it wasn't enough. But did she handle it appropriately?\n\nTelling a student directly about body odor can be sensitive. Maybe the teacher should have approached it in a more private way. However, the student's mom was aware, and the teacher is in a position to support the student's well-being. The way the teacher phrased it\u2014saying it's hard to seat him\u2014might have been a way to make the student understand without embarrassing him. \n\nThe student didn't react, just nodded. Maybe he's used to it, or maybe he's upset but didn't show it. The teacher's advice was practical and aimed at helping. But some might argue that the teacher should have handled it through the parent more and not directly confront the student, especially in front of others.\n\nBut the teacher did pull him aside after class, so it was private. The advice given was constructive. Considering the student's age, middle schoolers are sensitive, but the teacher's responsibility is to address issues that affect the classroom environment. The mom's response was that they have the means but he's not using them. So the teacher's approach might be justified to help the student improve his hygiene for his own social well-being.\n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? I think the answer is B, No. The teacher acted with good intentions, tried to be discreet, and provided helpful advice. The mom was involved first, so the teacher followed up appropriately. While the method could be debated, the action was taken for the student's benefit.\n"
