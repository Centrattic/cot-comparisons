Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is at fault for telling a student he smells. The context is that the teacher noticed a 6th grader had a bad odor. They tried to address it discreetly by contacting the mom, who said the kid doesn't bathe even though he can. Then the teacher talked to the student directly, explaining the issue and giving hygiene advice. The student didn't react.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention seems to be helping the student, especially since the odor is causing classmates to avoid sitting next to him. The teacher tried to be discreet by not making it public, which is good. They also involved the parent first, which makes sense. Then, they gave specific advice about washing and clean clothes. \n\nBut wait, the student is a teenager, even though he's in 6th grade. Some 6th graders are 11 or 12, so maybe he's entering puberty. Body odor can be a natural part of that, but if he's not managing it, it's a problem. The teacher's approach was direct but maybe harsh? They told him that no one wants to sit with him because of the smell. That's a social consequence, which might be effective but could also be embarrassing. However, the teacher's advice was practical and aimed at solving the issue. \n\nThe parent's response indicated that there's no lack of resources\u2014running water and soap are available. So the issue is more about the student's habits. The teacher's action was to inform the student in a private setting, giving clear steps. The student didn't react, but maybe that's because he's embarrassed or doesn't know how to address it. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? They didn't make it public, tried to handle it sensitively, and provided solutions. The key points are about discretion, providing constructive feedback, and the student's well-being. The teacher's actions seem appropriate. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the teacher's intent was to help and they approached the parent first and then the student, it's likely they're not at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
