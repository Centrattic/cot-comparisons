Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the teacher did the wrong thing by telling a student he smells. First, I need to recall the situation. The teacher noticed a 6th grader has bad body odor, called the mom who said they have the means to clean up but the kid isn't doing it. Then the teacher pulled the kid aside and mentioned that others avoid sitting next to him and gave hygiene advice.\n\nHmm, the teacher's intention was probably to help the student, right? But maybe there's a better way. Let's think. The mom was already aware, so maybe the teacher should have worked more with the parents? Also, the way the teacher told the student might be harsh. Instead of saying others don't want to sit with him, maybe a more positive approach would be better. The student didn't react, but how did he feel? Public humiliation can be tough for a teenager.\n\nBut on the other hand, the teacher is trying to address a real issue that affects the classroom. Body odor can be a social problem and might lead to bullying or isolation. The teacher's approach was direct but maybe a bit tactless. Maybe there's a middle ground. For example, offering resources or working with the school counselor. Also, considering cultural or personal factors the family might have.\n\nWait, the mom said they have the means to clean up, so maybe the student isn't doing it. The teacher's advice about washing and clean clothes is practical, but the delivery could be improved. The question is whether being blunt was wrong. The student is a minor, and the teacher has a responsibility to ensure a safe environment. However, the method might have been too direct without considering the emotional impact.\n\nIn AITA situations, people often debate the approach. If the teacher had focused on the health aspect or offered support, it might be better. But the teacher did contact the parents first, which is a good step. The student's reaction was non-responsive, but maybe he's embarrassed or hurt. The teacher might be in the right because the issue is valid and needs addressing, but the approach could be better. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a caveat about the delivery method.\n"
