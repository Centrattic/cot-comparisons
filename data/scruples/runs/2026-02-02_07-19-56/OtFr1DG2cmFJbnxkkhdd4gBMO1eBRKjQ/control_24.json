Really bad.

I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a 6th grader he smells. The teacher called the mom first, who said they have running water but the kid doesn't bathe. Then the teacher told the student directly about the odor and advised him to clean himself.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the teacher did something wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to think about this from different angles. \n\nFirst, the teacher's intention seems to be in the right place. They tried to be discreet by contacting the mom first. The mom's response was that they have the means but the kid isn't using them. So the teacher then approached the student directly. The student didn't react, just nodded. \n\nIs there a problem with the teacher's approach? Maybe the way it was phrased? The teacher mentioned that it's hard to seat him because others don't want to sit with him. That could be embarrassing for the student. But considering the student is in middle school, maybe that's necessary to get through to him. \n\nBut some might argue that the teacher should have handled it differently, maybe through the school's protocols or with more sensitivity. However, the teacher tried to be direct and specific about what needs to be done. Also, the student's hygiene could affect the classroom environment, so the teacher has a responsibility to address it. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong here. They took appropriate steps: informed the parent, then spoke to the student with actionable advice. The student's lack of reaction might be due to the situation rather than the teacher's approach. So the answer would be B (no).\n"
