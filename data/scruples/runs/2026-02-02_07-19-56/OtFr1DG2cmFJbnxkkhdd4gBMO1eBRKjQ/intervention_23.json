Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The teacher is asking if they're at fault for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has bad body odor, and the teacher tried to address it by talking to the mom first. The mom said they have resources but the kid isn't using them. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and mentioned the smell affecting seating and advised hygiene steps. The student didn't react.\n\nSo, the user thinks the teacher is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the teacher did something wrong. Let's break it down. The teacher's intention was to help the student, right? Bad body odor can be really isolating for a kid, making it hard to sit with others, which affects his social and academic environment. The teacher tried to approach it discreetly by talking to the mom first, which makes sense because it's a sensitive issue. When the mom didn't provide enough support, the teacher had to address it directly with the student. \n\nBut maybe the way the teacher communicated it could be better? Saying that it's hard to find someone to sit with him might make the student feel embarrassed or stigmatized. However, the alternative is not addressing it at all, which could make the situation worse for the student. The teacher gave practical advice about hygiene without being confrontational. The student's lack of reaction might be due to shock or not knowing how to respond, but the teacher's approach seems well-meaning. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a more appropriate way to handle this. Should the teacher have involved the school counselor or another authority? But the teacher did try to be discreet and didn't make it public. The advice given was accurate and helpful. Considering the student is 6th grade, they might not realize their hygiene is an issue. The teacher's intervention was to prevent further social issues in the classroom. \n\nSo, from a standpoint of intent and action, the teacher acted in the student's best interest. The method might be debatable, but the core action isn't malicious. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
