Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a middle school teacher who noticed a student has a bad odor. They called the mom, who acknowledged the problem but didn't seem to have a solution. Then the teacher directly told the student that his smell is causing seating issues and gave him hygiene advice.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention is to help the student, right? They wanted to be discreet by talking to the mom first. The mom said they have water and he can bathe but doesn't. Then the teacher spoke to the student, explaining the problem and advising him to clean himself daily. The student didn't react much.\n\nNow, is the teacher in the wrong? Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, the student is a minor, so parents are responsible for their care. The teacher might not have the authority to give personal hygiene advice directly. But the teacher is in a position where they have to manage the classroom environment, and the odor is affecting other students' willingness to sit with him. That could create a hostile environment, which the teacher is duty-bound to address.\n\nHowever, the teacher's approach was direct. Maybe they could have handled it differently, like working more with the parents or the school's counseling services. But in this case, the mom didn't act, so the teacher took initiative. The advice given was basic hygiene, which is necessary for a healthy environment. The student didn't react, but the teacher's actions were aimed at helping him avoid bullying or isolation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the teacher overstepped by publicly addressing the issue. Wait, no, it was a private conversation after class. The teacher's message was constructive, focusing on the impact on others and providing solutions. The student needed to know to improve his hygiene for his own social and health reasons.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the teacher's actions were appropriate. They tried to be discreet, informed the parent, and then gave the student direct but kind advice. The student's well-being and the classroom environment are important. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
