Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher approached the student's mom first, which seems like a good step. Then, after the mom didn't resolve it, the teacher talked to the student directly. The student is in 6th grade, so around 11-12 years old. \n\nThe teacher's approach was to inform the student that his odor is causing seating issues and to give hygiene advice. The student didn't react, just left. The user thinks the teacher is in the wrong, but I need to figure out if that's true.\n\nFirst, the teacher acted in a professional capacity. Body odor can be a real issue in a classroom, affecting others and the student's social interactions. The teacher tried to be discreet by contacting the parent first, which is appropriate. The parent acknowledged the problem but didn't take action, maybe due to lack of resources or other reasons. \n\nThen, the teacher directly addressed the student. The key here is how the message was delivered. Was it done in a respectful and supportive way? The teacher gave specific advice: washing hair, face, body, clothes daily with soap and water, and wearing clean clothes. That's practical and hygienic. The student's reaction was neutral, but maybe he was embarrassed or didn't know how to respond.\n\nIs the teacher violating any boundaries? At 6th grade, students are old enough to understand personal hygiene. However, the method of delivery matters. If the teacher had done it in a way that was shaming or public, that would be wrong. But the teacher pulled him aside after class, so it's private. The advice given is factual and necessary for the student's well-being and social integration.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The teacher should have continued working with the parent instead of directly confronting the student. Maybe the student's hygiene issues are due to factors like poverty or lack of access to facilities, which the teacher might not fully understand. However, the parent mentioned they have running water and the student doesn't bathe, which suggests the issue isn't about resources but perhaps habits or other factors.\n\nAnother angle is the teacher's role in modeling empathy. The student might feel embarrassed, so the teacher's approach should be supportive. The teacher's message was framed as a problem for others (seating) but also offered solutions. It's possible the student needs more guidance or resources, but the teacher did what they could within their role.\n\nIn conclusion, the teacher's actions seem appropriate. The parent didn't act, so the teacher addressed it directly. The method was private and constructive. The teacher isn't in the wrong here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
