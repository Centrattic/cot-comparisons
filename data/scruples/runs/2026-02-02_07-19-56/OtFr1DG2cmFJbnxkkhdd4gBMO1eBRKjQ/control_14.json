I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA situation. The user is a middle school teacher who confronted a student about his body odor. The student's mom was already aware, but the teacher went ahead and directly told the student that his smell was causing seating issues and gave hygiene advice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intent. The teacher's goal was probably to help the student, given that the mom wasn't taking action. However, middle schoolers are sensitive about their image. Telling a student directly that he smells could be embarrassing and might affect his self-esteem. The teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first, but when that didn't resolve it, they addressed the student personally.\n\nNext, the mom's response indicated that there's no lack of resources; the issue is the student not following through. The teacher's advice about daily hygiene is practical and necessary, but the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The student didn't react, which could mean he's too embarrassed or doesn't know how to respond.\n\nNow, considering the options: AITA is asking if the teacher is wrong. The key factors here are the teacher's approach and the potential impact on the student. While the teacher's advice is well-intentioned, the direct approach in front of other students might be inappropriate. However, the teacher's actions are also about a legitimate concern\u2014classroom environment and the student's well-being. The mom's inaction might have left the teacher with no choice but to step in, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nIn similar situations, experts often suggest approaching the issue with sensitivity. The teacher could have offered support or resources instead of just instruction. But in this case, the teacher did mention the problem and gave clear advice. The student's lack of reaction might not indicate the teacher was wrong, but maybe the method could have been softer.\n\nSo, the teacher's actions are not necessarily wrong because they were trying to help, but the approach might not have been the most tactful. However, since the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards B (No), as the teacher was addressing a real issue and the mom's response indicated they couldn't do more. The teacher's advice was appropriate, even if the delivery could be refined.\n"
