Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the middle school teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher noticed the student has a bad odor. They tried to address it by contacting the mom, who said the student doesn't bathe even though he has the means. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and told him about the odor issue, the impact on seating, and advised him to clean himself daily. The student didn't react, just left.\n\nI need to consider if the teacher's approach was appropriate. The teacher's goal is to help the student, so they didn't just ignore the problem. They first tried to be discreet by talking to the mom. When that didn't work, they directly addressed the student in a private setting. The advice given is practical and specific\u2014washing with soap, clean clothes. It's not harsh or cruel; the teacher is concerned for the student's well-being and social integration.\n\nBut wait, maybe the teacher should have considered other factors. Could there be underlying issues like mental health, family dynamics, or cultural differences? The mom's response was dismissive, but the teacher might not have the full story. However, the teacher acted in good faith. Publicly addressing it could have been unkind, but they did it privately. The advice is factual and not judgmental. The student's reaction (no reaction) is worrying, but that's not the teacher's fault. They did the right thing by handling it discreetly and offering a solution. So I think the teacher is not in the wrong here.\n"
