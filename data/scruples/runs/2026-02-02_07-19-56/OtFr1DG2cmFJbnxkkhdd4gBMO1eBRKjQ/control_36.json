Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a 6th-grade boy he smells. The teacher called the mom first, which seems like a good step. The mom said she knows and that they have the means to clean, but the kid isn't doing it. Then the teacher pulled the kid aside and told him about the odor and how it's affecting his seating, giving advice on hygiene.\n\nHmm, the key points here are whether the teacher's approach was appropriate. The teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first. The mom's response was dismissive. Then the teacher addressed the student directly, using a factual approach without shaming. The student didn't react, just nodded. \n\nI think the teacher's main goal was to help the student, both in terms of his hygiene and social integration. The advice given was practical and necessary. There's no indication that the teacher was rude or public about it. The student is a teenager, and body odor can be a problem during that age due to puberty. The teacher's actions were aimed at supporting the student's well-being and classroom environment. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the teacher is not in the wrong. They handled it with care, first contacting the parent and then the student, focusing on solutions rather than humiliation. There's no evidence of bullying or harsh treatment here. The teacher's intention was clearly to help, not to embarrass the student.\n"
