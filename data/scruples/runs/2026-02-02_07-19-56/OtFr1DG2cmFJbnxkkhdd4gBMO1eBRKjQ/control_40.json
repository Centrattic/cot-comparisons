Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The teacher is asking if they're at fault for telling a student he smells. The situation involves a middle school boy with body odor, and the teacher approached both the mom and the student directly.\n\nFirst, the teacher tried to be discreet by calling the mom. The mom acknowledged the issue but didn't know what to do, even though they have running water. Then the teacher talked to the student about washing and wearing clean clothes. The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher now feels awful.\n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? Well, the teacher's intention was to help the student, as the odor was affecting the classroom environment. Other students probably didn't want to sit next to him, which could isolate him. The teacher's approach might seem harsh, but it's a practical solution. However, maybe the teacher could have handled it more sensitively, considering the student's feelings. But given the context, the teacher was trying to address a real issue that impacts the student's social interactions. The mom's response indicated they had the resources but the student wasn't using them. The teacher's advice was practical. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
