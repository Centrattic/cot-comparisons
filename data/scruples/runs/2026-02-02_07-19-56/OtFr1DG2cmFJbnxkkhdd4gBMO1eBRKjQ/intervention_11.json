Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student's odor is affecting the classroom, and the teacher tried to address it by talking to his mom first. The mom said they have the means to clean but he doesn't do it. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and told him about the odor and the seating issue, advising him to wash and wear clean clothes.\n\nHmm. The teacher's goal was probably to help the student, but the way they approached it might be a problem. Body odor is a sensitive topic, especially for a teenager who might already be self-conscious. Telling the student in front of others or even in a private setting could still be embarrassing. The teacher might have done it discreetly, but the message itself could be harsh. The key points here are intent vs. impact. The teacher's intent was to help, but the impact on the student's self-esteem and dignity could be negative. Also, maybe there's a better way to handle it, like involving school counselors or providing resources instead of directly confronting the student. The mom's response suggests that there might be a lack of awareness or resources, but the teacher might not have enough context. So, considering all that, the teacher might not be in the wrong because they tried to address the issue constructively, but maybe they could have done it more sensitively. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the student is suffering from hygiene issues beyond their control, maybe the teacher overstepped. But if the student is capable and just not doing it, then the teacher's advice is valid. It's a bit of a tricky situation. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific circumstances. But given that the teacher tried to approach it privately and with a solution in mind, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the way it was phrased could be seen as harsh. So, the answer could be either A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue the opposite. Need to weigh the sensitivity versus the necessity to address the issue. I think the teacher's approach is well-intentioned but could be improved, but not necessarily wrong. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
