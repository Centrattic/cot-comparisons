Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher noticed a student's bad odor and tried to address it discreetly by contacting the mother. The mom acknowledged the issue but didn't provide a solution. Then the teacher spoke directly to the student, explaining the problem and giving hygiene advice. The student didn't react.\n\nSo, the teacher's actions were aimed at helping the student, both by involving the parent and then giving direct advice. The key points here are intent and approach. The teacher wanted to help, not humiliate. The method was to inform the student and suggest practical steps. The student's lack of reaction might be due to embarrassment or not knowing how to respond.\n\nBut is the teacher in the wrong? Well, it's a sensitive issue. Teachers have a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment. However, addressing hygiene issues is necessary to prevent bullying or social isolation. The teacher tried to be discreet and constructive. They didn't make it a public shaming but a private conversation. The advice given was factual and helpful. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the teacher could have approached it with more empathy, but the actions seem well-intentioned. The student's mom was aware, so the teacher's step was appropriate. The teacher isn't at fault here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
