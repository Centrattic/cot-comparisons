Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, who said they have running water and he can bathe but doesn't. Then the teacher told the student directly about his odor and gave hygiene advice.\n\nHmm, the key points here. The teacher's intention was to address the odor issue to make the student more comfortable in class. The mom was involved, but the student didn't change, so the teacher took direct action. The student's reaction was to just nod and leave, which is a bit concerning. \n\nBut is the teacher wrong? Well, as a teacher, part of their role is to support students' well-being, including hygiene. However, approaching the student directly might have been a bit harsh depending on the method. The teacher mentioned that seating was an issue because students didn't want to sit next to him. But maybe the teacher could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps by offering resources or a more private discussion. \n\nThe mom's response was dismissive, so the teacher had to take action. However, the teacher's statement about seating might have been public, which could have embarrassed the student. Maybe the teacher should have addressed it in a way that doesn't single the student out in front of others, even indirectly. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did contact the mom first, which is appropriate. The advice given was practical. The problem might be more about the method of delivery rather than the content. The student's lack of reaction might indicate he's used to it or feels embarrassed but doesn't know how to respond. \n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? Probably not entirely. They had good intentions and tried to handle it discreetly. But could they have been more compassionate in their approach? Maybe. But overall, the action seems necessary to address a health or comfort issue in the classroom. So the answer might be B (No), but with a note about sensitivity.\n"
