Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is at fault for telling a student he smells. The teacher approached the student's mom first, and when that didn't work, she talked to the student directly. The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher feels awful now.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if the teacher did the wrong thing. First, body odor in a student is a real issue, especially in middle school where kids are developing socially. The teacher's job is to maintain a respectful environment for all students. If other students are being affected, the teacher has a responsibility to address it.\n\nThe teacher first contacted the mother, which is the right step. The mom acknowledged the problem but didn't offer help. Then the teacher spoke to the student. The teacher's message was clear and direct but also provided practical advice. The student didn't react, maybe because he was embarrassed or didn't know how to respond. \n\nBut wait, is it appropriate to single out a student about their body odor? There's a balance between being compassionate and addressing a real issue. The teacher didn't use harsh language, just explained the problem and gave solutions. However, maybe the teacher could have been more discreet or offered support. But given that the mom didn't help, the teacher had to take action. \n\nAlso, the teacher's intention was to help the student, not to humiliate him. The advice given was practical and necessary. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
