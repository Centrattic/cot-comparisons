Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher approached the student's mom first, which is a good step. Then when the mom said they have the means but the kid isn't using them, the teacher talked to the student directly. The student didn't react, just nodded.\n\nHmm. The teacher's intention was to help, right? Body odor can be really distracting and affect social interactions. The teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first. When that didn't resolve it, they addressed the student. But maybe the way they phrased it was harsh? The teacher said it was hard to find someone to sit with him because of the smell. That might have been embarrassing for the student. The student not reacting could mean he's in denial or maybe just too embarrassed to respond. \n\nBut is the teacher in the wrong? I think the teacher's actions were well-intentioned. They didn't make it a public issue, handled it privately, and gave practical advice. The mom's response indicated it's a behavioral issue, not a lack of resources. So the teacher's advice to the student to bathe and wear clean clothes is appropriate. However, maybe there's a better way to approach it without making the student feel singled out. But given the situation, the teacher did the right thing to address a hygiene issue that affects the classroom environment. So probably the answer is B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
