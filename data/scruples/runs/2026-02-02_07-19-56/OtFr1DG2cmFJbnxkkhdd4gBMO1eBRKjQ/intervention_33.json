Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is at fault for telling a student he smells. The teacher tried to handle it discreetly by contacting the mom, who acknowledged the issue but didn't take action. Then the teacher talked to the student directly, explaining the problem and giving advice. The student didn't react.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. They wanted to be kind and helpful, not just to embarrass the student. They also informed the parent first, which is part of their responsibility. But maybe the approach could have been different. Did the teacher cross a line? The student is a teenager, and body odor can be a sensitive issue. The teacher's message was straightforward, but maybe it was too direct. However, the teacher didn't publicly shame him, which is important. They tried to give practical advice, which is reasonable. The parent's response was that they can't force the child to bathe, so the teacher stepped in. In a school setting, teachers have a duty to create a comfortable environment for all students, so this is part of their role. The problem is whether the method was appropriate. The teacher could have maybe involved the parent more, but they already did. The student not reacting might be due to embarrassment or other factors. Overall, the teacher's actions seem to be well-intentioned and within their responsibility, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that it's a parent's responsibility, but the teacher did their part. Hmm.\n"
