Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, who said they have running water and the kid just doesn't bathe. Then the teacher told the student directly about the odor and gave advice. The student didn't react.\n\nHmm. The teacher's intention was to be discreet and help the student. They approached the parent first, which is the right step. Then when that didn't work, they talked to the student. The advice given was practical\u2014washing with soap and clean clothes. The teacher also mentioned seating issues, which is a sensitive way to explain the problem without being mean. The student didn't react, so maybe he's embarrassed but didn't show it.\n\nIs there a problem here? The teacher is trying to help the student improve his hygiene, which is a valid concern. It's part of their role to support students' well-being. The mom acknowledged the issue and said they can take care of it, so the teacher's approach seems appropriate. The student's reaction doesn't indicate harm, just maybe shyness. So the teacher isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
