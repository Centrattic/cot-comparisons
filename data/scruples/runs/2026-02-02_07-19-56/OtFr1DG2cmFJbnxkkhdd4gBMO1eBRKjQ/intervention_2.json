Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher tried to address the body odor issue by talking to the student directly and also contacting the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The student is a 6th grader, so around 11-12 years old. Body odor can be a sensitive issue, especially during puberty. The teacher's approach was to be discreet, which is good, but maybe the way they communicated it could have been more compassionate.\n\nThe teacher mentioned that the mother knew about the issue and said they have the resources to clean but the student doesn't do it. So the problem might be on the student's end. However, the teacher's comment about seating because of the odor could be seen as embarrassing. The student didn't react, but that doesn't mean he wasn't hurt.\n\nI should think about age-appropriate communication. Maybe the teacher could have used a different approach, like offering help or resources instead of directly pointing out the smell. Also, involving the parent is a good step, but maybe the teacher should have handled it differently to avoid making the student feel shamed.\n\nIn school settings, teachers have a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment. Addressing hygiene issues is part of that, but the method matters. If the student is from a background where they might not have been taught proper hygiene, the approach should be more supportive. The teacher's instruction to wash thoroughly and wear clean clothes is practical, but the delivery could have been softer.\n\nSo, considering all this, the teacher might be in the right because they tried to handle it discreetly and with the student's well-being in mind. However, there's a chance the approach could have been more empathetic. Since the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but with some caveats about the method.\n"
