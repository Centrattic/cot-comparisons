Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has body odor, the teacher tried to contact the mom, who said they have the means to clean but the kid isn't doing it. Then the teacher told the kid directly that his smell is causing seating issues and told him to clean up.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention here seems good. They want to help the student, maybe prevent bullying or social issues. But how did they approach it? Telling the class he's hard to seat because of his smell might make the student feel embarrassed. Even though the teacher did it discreetly, the message could still be hurtful. The mom was contacted first, which is a good step. But maybe the teacher should have focused more on the health or comfort aspect rather than making it a social issue. Also, the mom's response suggests there's a will to help, but maybe the student needs more guidance or support. The teacher's approach might have been direct but could have been more compassionate. Maybe using a different method, like offering hygiene tips or involving school counselors, would have been better. So the answer might lean towards the teacher being in the wrong because of the way the message was delivered, even if the intent was good.\n"
