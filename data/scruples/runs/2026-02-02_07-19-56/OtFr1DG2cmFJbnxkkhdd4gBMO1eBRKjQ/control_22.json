Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a middle school educator and has a student who smells bad. She tried to address it by talking to the mom, who confirmed the kid doesn't bathe despite having the means. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and told him about the odor affecting seating and gave hygiene advice.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention seems good. She's trying to help the student, who might not understand personal hygiene. But the way she approached it could be harsh. Telling a teenager he smells can be embarrassing, especially in front of others, even if it's private. The student's mom says he can bathe but doesn't, so maybe there's a deeper issue here, like rebellion or lack of awareness.\n\nThe teacher called the mom first, which is appropriate. Then she spoke to the student directly, which is necessary. However, the phrasing might be an issue. Saying it's hard to seat him because others don't want to sit with him could be hurtful. Maybe there's a more respectful way to convey the message without making the student feel singled out.\n\nAlso, the student didn't react, which might indicate he's either embarrassed or doesn't take the advice. The teacher might need to consider if there's a different approach, like involving a counselor or providing resources. But in terms of being in the wrong, the teacher's actions are well-intentioned and within her role to support the student's well-being. So while the delivery could be improved, the act itself isn't wrong. The answer is B.\n"
