Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, and the mom said they have running water but the kid doesn't bathe. Then the teacher told the student directly that his odor is causing seating issues and advised him to clean up.\n\nHmm. So, the teacher tried to be discreet by contacting the mom first. The mom's response was that she knows and asks what to do. The teacher then addresses the student directly, explaining the problem and giving advice. The student didn't react, just nodded.\n\nI need to consider if the teacher overstepped. In a school setting, teachers do have a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment. Body odor can be a distraction and affect other students. However, the approach matters. The teacher did try to handle it privately, first with the parent and then the student. The advice given was practical and non-humiliating. The teacher didn't make a public announcement but spoke to the student one-on-one.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way? Like, involving school counselors or using more resources. However, the teacher's intent was to help the student and prevent social issues. Since the student didn't react, it's possible he was embarrassed or didn't know how to respond. The teacher's advice was constructive and focused on solutions. Given that the parent confirmed there's no lack of resources, the student's hygiene is a personal choice or possibly a lack of knowledge. The teacher's action seems appropriate to address a real issue that affects classroom environment. So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
