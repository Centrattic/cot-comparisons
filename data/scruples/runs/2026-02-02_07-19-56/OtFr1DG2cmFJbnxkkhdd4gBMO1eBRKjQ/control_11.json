Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has body odor, the teacher tried to contact the mom, who said they can bathe but he doesn't. Then the teacher pulled him aside and told him about the smell and the seating issue, advising hygiene steps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's responsibility. Teachers often have to address issues that affect the classroom environment. Body odor can be a sensitive topic, especially with teenagers. The teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first. The mom acknowledged the problem but the student wasn't following through. \n\nThen the teacher spoke directly to the student, without being confrontational, gave advice on hygiene, and mentioned the seating issue to explain the impact. The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher feels awful about it, which shows concern for the student's feelings.\n\nPotential issues: Was the teacher too direct? Could there be underlying issues like financial hardship or personal hygiene challenges not addressed by the parent? Maybe the student's mom isn't effectively addressing it, but the teacher did what they could. The teacher's approach seems respectful, focusing on the behavior and offering solutions. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the key is whether the action was reasonable. The teacher's intention was to help and improve the classroom environment. The student's dignity was considered by a private conversation and not public shaming. The mom was involved first. So the teacher is probably not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
