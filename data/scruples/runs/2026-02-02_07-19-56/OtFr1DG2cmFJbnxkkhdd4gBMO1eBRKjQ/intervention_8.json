Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is asking if they're at fault for telling a student he smells. The situation involves a 6th grader with body odor that's affecting the classroom environment. The teacher tried to address it discreetly by talking to the mom first, who acknowledged the issue but didn't know how to handle it. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and explained the problem, telling him he needs to wash himself and wear clean clothes.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the teacher is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The teacher's intention was to help the student, right? Body odor can be really isolating for kids, leading to bullying or social issues. By addressing it, the teacher might be trying to prevent that. However, the way it was done could be problematic. Telling a kid he smells in front of others might be embarrassing, especially if it's done in a class setting. But the teacher said they pulled him aside after class, so maybe it was private.\n\nWait, the student didn't react, just nodded. Maybe it was a relief for him that someone finally mentioned it. The mom's response was that they have the means to clean but he doesn't. So the teacher was trying to support the student by giving practical advice. But is it the teacher's responsibility to give hygiene advice? Maybe, especially if the school has policies about such issues. However, the teacher should probably involve the school nurse or counselor first, rather than handling it alone. But in this case, they did contact the mom first, which is a good step.\n\nThe key points are: the teacher acted with good intent to help the student, approached the parent first, then gave the student direct advice in a private setting. The student's reaction was neutral, but maybe he's too embarrassed to show any emotion. The teacher's actions might be appropriate, but there's a line between helping and being harsh. The advice given (washing with soap, clean clothes) is basic and necessary, not shaming. So maybe the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
