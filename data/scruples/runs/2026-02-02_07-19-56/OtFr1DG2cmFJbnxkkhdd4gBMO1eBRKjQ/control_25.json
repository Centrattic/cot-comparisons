Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, which seems responsible. The mom knows but the kid isn't bathing. The teacher then talks to the student directly, explaining the issue and giving advice. The student doesn't react. The teacher feels bad but is trying to help.\n\nHmm. The teacher's intention is to help the student, right? Body odor can lead to social issues, especially in a school setting. The teacher tried to handle it discreetly by talking to the mom first. When that didn't resolve it, addressing the student directly makes sense. The advice given is practical and basic hygiene tips. The student might be embarrassed, but the teacher's approach seems supportive, not mean. \n\nBut wait, is there a better way? Maybe the teacher could have involved the school counselor or provided resources? However, the situation doesn't mention any disabilities or other issues. The mom said they have the means to clean, so it's more about compliance. The teacher's actions are aimed at the student's well-being and the classroom environment. \n\nI think the teacher is in the right here. The answer should be B (No), because the teacher is acting in the student's best interest and trying to address a problem that affects both the student and the classroom. The approach was direct but kind, and the teacher isn't being cruel. The student's lack of reaction might be due to shyness or shock, but the teacher's intent was good.\n"
