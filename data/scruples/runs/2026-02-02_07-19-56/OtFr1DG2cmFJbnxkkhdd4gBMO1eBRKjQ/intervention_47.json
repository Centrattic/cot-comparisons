Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a middle school student he smells. The situation is that the student's mom was aware but didn't help, and the teacher approached the student directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. They tried to be discreet by contacting the mom first, which is a good step. The mom acknowledged the issue but didn't have a solution. The teacher then spoke to the student, explaining the problem and giving advice on hygiene. The student didn't react, but the teacher is feeling awful about it.\n\nNow, is this the teacher's fault? Bodily odor can be a real issue affecting a student's social and academic life. The teacher is trying to protect the student's well-being, both in terms of health and social acceptance. Middle schoolers are sensitive about such things, and the teacher's approach was direct but not mean. They provided practical steps instead of shaming the student. \n\nHowever, maybe the teacher could have involved the school counselor or another professional to handle it more sensitively. But given the context, the teacher's actions seem well-intentioned. The mom didn't act, so the teacher had to step in to prevent the student from being ostracized. The student's lack of reaction might indicate discomfort, but the teacher's advice was constructive.\n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong. They addressed a real problem in a reasonable way. The answer should be B.\n"
