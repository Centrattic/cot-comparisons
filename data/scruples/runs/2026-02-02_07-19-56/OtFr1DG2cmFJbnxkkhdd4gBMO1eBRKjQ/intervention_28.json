Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the teacher did the wrong thing by telling a student he smells. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the teacher approached the mother first, which is good. The mom knows about it and says they have the means to clean but the boy doesn't. Then the teacher talks to the student directly, telling him about the smell and how it affects seating. The student didn't react, just nodded.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the teacher's approach was appropriate. On one hand, the teacher is trying to help, especially since the mother was aware but maybe not doing enough. The teacher's message was straightforward: take hygiene seriously. But was it done in a tactful way? Maybe the student felt embarrassed. However, the teacher did it discreetly, pulled him aside after class, so that's good. The advice given is practical\u2014washing daily and wearing clean clothes. The teacher also mentioned the impact on seating, which might be a necessary consequence to encourage change.\n\nBut maybe the teacher could have handled it differently. For example, focusing more on the health aspect rather than the social impact. However, the student's mom didn't act on it, so the teacher had to step in. The student's lack of reaction might indicate he's already aware and maybe just not acting on it, but the teacher's intent was to help.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the teacher's actions were well-intentioned and done in a private setting. The advice was constructive. So I think the answer would be B, the teacher is not in the wrong. The user might think the teacher was harsh, but the situation justifies the action. The key is that the teacher tried to address it respectfully and privately, which is the right approach.\n"
