Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is at fault for telling a student he smells. The scenario is that the student has bad body odor, the teacher tried to contact the mom, who said they have the means to clean but he doesn't. Then the teacher told the student directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's actions. The teacher approached the mom first, which is good. The mom knows about the issue. Then the teacher talks to the student, not in a mean way but explaining the problem and giving advice. The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher feels awful about it.\n\nNow, is the teacher wrong? Well, the situation is about a student's hygiene, which can affect others. The teacher's intention was to help, not to humiliate. The student is in middle school, so dealing with puberty changes. Body odor is common, but if it's causing others to avoid sitting next to him, it's a valid concern.\n\nThe teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first. When that didn't resolve it, addressing the student directly with advice seems reasonable. The student's mom indicated that he's aware but not acting on it. The teacher's advice to clean daily is practical. The student's non-reaction might be due to embarrassment or not knowing how to respond.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe, but the teacher's approach was direct and constructive. The teacher isn't bullying the student; they're trying to help. So, the answer is likely B, No. The teacher isn't in the wrong here.\n"
