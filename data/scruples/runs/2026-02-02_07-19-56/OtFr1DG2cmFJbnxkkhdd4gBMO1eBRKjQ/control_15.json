Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The teacher approached a 6th-grade boy about his body odor, right? The student smells bad, and the teacher tried to handle it by talking to his mom first, who didn't seem to help. Then the teacher pulled the boy aside and told him that people don't want to sit next to him because of the smell and gave him advice on hygiene.\n\nHmm, is the teacher in the wrong here? Well, as a teacher, part of their job is to create a respectful and inclusive environment. If a student is causing discomfort to others, the teacher has a responsibility to address it. But the way it's handled matters. The teacher did try to be discreet by talking to the mom first. But the mom wasn't helpful. Then the teacher spoke directly to the student, explaining the impact of his odor and giving clear steps to improve hygiene.\n\nThe student is a teenager, so maybe he's going through puberty and might not realize how bad he smells. The teacher's approach was direct but not harsh. They mentioned the effect on others and offered practical advice. It's possible that the student might be embarrassed, but the teacher's intent was to help him avoid social isolation in the classroom. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a different approach. For example, using a general hygiene reminder for all students instead of singling out one. But the problem here is specific to this student. If others aren't having the same issue, it's reasonable to address him individually. \n\nThe mom's response suggests that there might be underlying issues at home, but the teacher can only do so much. The key is that the teacher didn't make a public humiliation but tried to handle it privately. The student didn't react, but the teacher's intention was to support him. So, maybe the teacher isn't in the wrong here. The answer is probably B, No.\n"
