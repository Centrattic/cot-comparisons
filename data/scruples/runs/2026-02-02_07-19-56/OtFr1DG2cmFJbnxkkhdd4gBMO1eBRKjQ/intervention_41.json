Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, which is a good step. The mom said they have running water and he can bathe but doesn't. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and explained the situation, telling him to clean himself every day.\n\nHmm. The teacher's intention was to help the student, right? They probably wanted to address the body odor issue to make the classroom environment better for everyone. But maybe the way they approached it was too direct or harsh? The student didn't react, just nodded. That could mean he's upset or maybe embarrassed. The teacher might have made the student feel humiliated. \n\nBut on the other hand, the teacher did try to be discreet by talking to the mom first and then addressing the student privately. They gave practical advice about hygiene. It's possible that the student has issues beyond just not wanting to bathe\u2014maybe there's a medical condition, or he's going through something else. The teacher might not know that. \n\nIs there a better way to handle this? Maybe involving the school counselor or providing resources? But in this case, the teacher did what they thought was necessary to support the student and the class. The question is whether the approach was appropriate. \n\nSome might argue that the teacher crossed a line by directly calling out the smell, even if it's true. Others might say it's a necessary step to help the student. I think the teacher's intention was good, but maybe the execution could have been softer. But since the mom was already informed and the student was spoken to in private, maybe it's okay. The answer depends on whether the method was respectful and supportive enough. \n\nI'm leaning towards the teacher not being in the wrong (B) because they took a direct approach to a practical problem, but I can see arguments for both sides. The key points are the teacher's attempt to be discreet and helpful, even if the student felt embarrassed.\n"
