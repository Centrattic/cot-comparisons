Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a middle school educator who noticed a student had a bad smell. They approached the student's mom first, which seems like a responsible step. The mom acknowledged the issue and mentioned that the family has the resources to bathe and clean, but the boy isn't doing it. Then the teacher spoke to the student, telling him that his body odor is causing seating issues and gave hygiene advice. The student didn't react.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer. \n\nFirst, the teacher's actions: they tried to address the issue discreetly by contacting the parent first. That's good because it avoids singling out the student in front of others. The parent was aware, so the teacher then directly addressed the student. The advice given was practical and necessary for hygiene. The student's lack of reaction might be due to embarrassment or other factors, but the teacher's intent was to help.\n\nPotential issues could be if the teacher made the student feel humiliated or if the approach was too harsh. However, the teacher framed it as helping with seating and provided specific steps. There's no indication of public shaming. The teacher's actions were aimed at solving a problem that affects the classroom environment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the teacher should have considered other factors, like the student's personal circumstances or mental health, but the parent indicated it's a choice. Since the teacher used a private conversation and gave constructive advice without harsh judgment, it seems appropriate. So the answer is B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
