Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong here. The teacher approached a student about his body odor, which is causing issues in the classroom. The mom was already informed, and the teacher then talked to the student directly.\n\nFirst, body odor can be a sensitive issue, especially for a teenager. The teacher's intention was to help, but maybe the approach could have been more empathetic. They mentioned it's hard to seat others next to him, which might make the student feel isolated. \n\nThe mom's response was that she knows but maybe doesn't know how to help. The teacher's advice to wash daily is practical, but maybe the teacher didn't consider if the student has other issues, like mental health or hygiene habits. \n\nBut on the other hand, the teacher is trying to address a real problem in the classroom. Students need to maintain hygiene for their own dignity and comfort of others. The teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first and then the student. The student didn't react, but that doesn't mean the teacher is wrong.\n\nHowever, maybe the teacher could have approached it in a more supportive way. But overall, the intention was good. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any ethical or professional guidelines. Teachers are expected to handle such situations with care, but it's part of their role to ensure a respectful environment.\n"
