Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. First, I need to consider the context. The student is a 6th grader, so a teenager, which is a time when body odor can become more noticeable. The teacher tried to address it discreetly by contacting the mom first. The mom acknowledged the issue and said they have the resources to address it but the boy still isn't taking action.\n\nThe teacher then spoke to the student directly, explaining that his odor is causing seating issues and gave him advice on hygiene. The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher feels awful about it. Now, the question is whether the teacher did something wrong.\n\nFrom a teacher's perspective, ensuring a respectful and inclusive classroom is important. However, approaching a student about body odor can be delicate. The teacher tried to be discreet by first talking to the parent, which is a good step. The parent's response suggests that the issue isn't about lack of resources but maybe the student's habits or awareness. \n\nThe teacher's advice to the student was direct but focused on the facts\u2014explaining the impact on seating and suggesting hygiene steps. The student's non-reaction might be due to embarrassment or not knowing how to respond. The teacher's concern is valid because the student's odor affects the classroom environment. However, the teacher might need to consider if there's an underlying issue, like anxiety or a medical condition, that the student isn't addressing. \n\nBut the teacher's actions were intended to help and maintain a respectful environment. They didn't mock or ridicule the student. The advice given is general and appropriate. The parent was involved, which is the right approach. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
