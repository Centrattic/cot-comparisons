Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has body odor, and the teacher tried to address it by talking to the mom first. The mom said they have running water and that the kid doesn't bathe. Then the teacher told the student directly that his smell is causing seating issues and instructed him to clean himself.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the teacher is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, body odor is a sensitive issue. Students can be very self-conscious about it. The teacher's approach might come off as harsh, especially if it's done in front of others or in a way that could humiliate the student. But the teacher did pull him aside after class, which is private. That's a good point. \n\nThe teacher also talked to the mom first, which shows they tried to involve the family. The mom's response was that they can bathe but he doesn't. Maybe there's a cultural or personal reason why the student isn't bathing. The teacher's advice was practical\u2014washing with soap and wearing clean clothes. But maybe the way it was delivered could be improved. \n\nHowever, the teacher's main concern is the student's well-being and the classroom environment. The student's odor is affecting his interactions with peers, as others don't want to sit next to him. The teacher is trying to help the student fit in and avoid social isolation. \n\nBut could there be a better way? Maybe providing resources or support, like mentioning school counselors if hygiene is due to a deeper issue. However, the teacher might not have the means to do that. \n\nThe student didn't react, just nodded. That could indicate he's in shock, embarrassed, or doesn't know how to respond. The teacher's approach might have been necessary but could have been delivered more sensitively. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the teacher's intention is to help. However, directly pointing out someone's smell can be hurtful, even if done in private. It's possible the teacher overstepped, but given the context, they might be trying to help. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could be more compassionate. The teacher tried to address it discreetly and gave practical advice. The student's mom was involved. The teacher isn't the one at fault here; maybe the situation's root cause is.\n"
