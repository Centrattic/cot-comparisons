Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The teacher is asking if they're at fault for telling a student he smells. The student is a sixth grader, so around 11-12 years old. The teacher mentioned that they called the mom first and the mom agreed that the kid doesn't bathe even though they have access to water. Then the teacher talked to the student directly, explaining the issue and giving advice on hygiene.\n\nFirst, the teacher tried to address the issue discreetly by contacting the parent first. That seems responsible. The parent's response was that they know, and they can bathe, but he doesn't. So the parent isn't helping. The teacher then approached the student, not in a harsh way, but explaining the problem and offering solutions. The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher now feels awful.\n\nIs the teacher wrong? Well, teaching kids about personal hygiene is part of being a responsible adult. Kids might not always understand these things, especially if their home environment isn't providing that education. The teacher's approach seems direct but not cruel. They didn't mock him in front of others, which could be harmful. They tried to explain the impact (no one wants to sit next to him) and practical steps to fix it. \n\nBut maybe the issue is the way it's framed. Telling a kid he smells can be embarrassing, even if done privately. However, the alternative is letting the kid suffer from social isolation due to bad odor. The teacher's intention was to help, and the method was to inform and advise. It's possible that the student might be dealing with other issues at home, but the teacher's responsibility is to address the immediate problem in a school setting. \n\nOn the other hand, could the teacher have handled it differently? Maybe. Perhaps offering some resources or support, but the situation doesn't mention that. Overall, the teacher's actions seem appropriate given the circumstances. They took steps to be discreet, informed the parent, and then directly advised the student. The parent's lack of action is a separate issue. So the teacher isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
