Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells.\n\nFirst, the teacher noticed the student's bad odor and tried to address it discreetly by contacting the mom. The mom acknowledged the issue but didn't know what to do. Then the teacher talked to the student directly, explaining the problem and giving advice on hygiene.\n\nI need to consider if the teacher crossed a line. The teacher's intention was to help, not to humiliate. They approached the student privately and gave practical advice. The mom didn't seem upset, just unsure. The student didn't react, but maybe he's embarrassed. \n\nIs there a better way? Maybe, but the teacher's approach seems reasonable. They didn't make it public, tried to be supportive. The key is whether the method was respectful. The advice given is factual and not shaming. So probably the teacher isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
