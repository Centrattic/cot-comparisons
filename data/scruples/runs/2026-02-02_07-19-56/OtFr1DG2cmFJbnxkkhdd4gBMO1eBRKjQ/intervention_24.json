Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has bad body odor, the teacher contacted the mom, who said they have running water and he can bathe but he doesn't. The teacher then pulled the student aside and told him about the odor and the seating issue, advising him to clean himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. The teacher was trying to be discreet, which is good. They approached the mom first, which makes sense because it's about the student's well-being. The mom was aware but maybe couldn't enforce the hygiene. The teacher then spoke to the student directly, which is part of their role to ensure a respectful environment. However, the student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher feels awful now, maybe worried about embarrassing the student.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? As a teacher, maintaining a classroom environment where students aren't made uncomfortable is important. The student's body odor is affecting others, so the teacher has a responsibility to address it. The approach seems respectful\u2014private conversation, focusing on hygiene without judgment, and providing solutions. But maybe the teacher could have done more through the parent first? The mom was already involved. The teacher isn't in the wrong for trying to help the student, especially since it's part of their role to foster a healthy environment. The alternative is letting other students be uncomfortable, which isn't fair. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
