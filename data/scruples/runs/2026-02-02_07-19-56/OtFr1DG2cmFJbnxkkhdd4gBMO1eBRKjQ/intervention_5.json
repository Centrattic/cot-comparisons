Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has body odor, the teacher tried to contact the mom, who said they have the means to clean but he doesn't. Then the teacher told the student directly about the odor and advised him to clean up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of a teacher. Teachers are responsible for students' well-being, including their hygiene if it affects their school experience. The student's odor is causing classmates not to sit with him, which can affect his social interactions and mental health. So the teacher's intention is to help the student.\n\nBut how did the teacher approach it? The teacher said it's hard to seat him because others don't want to sit with him. The mom already knew about the issue, so maybe the teacher was trying to involve the student directly since the parent wasn't handling it. But maybe the teacher could have approached it more sensitively. However, the teacher's advice was practical and aimed at solving the problem. The student didn't react, but that doesn't mean the teacher was wrong. The alternative might be letting the student suffer social rejection or bullying.\n\nIs it the teacher's responsibility to address hygiene issues? Yes, especially if it's affecting the student's school life. The teacher didn't publicly shame the student, spoke to him privately, and gave specific advice. The mom's response suggests that the problem is on the student's end, not a lack of resources. So the teacher's action seems appropriate. The user thinks the teacher is in the wrong, but based on the info, the teacher is trying to help. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
