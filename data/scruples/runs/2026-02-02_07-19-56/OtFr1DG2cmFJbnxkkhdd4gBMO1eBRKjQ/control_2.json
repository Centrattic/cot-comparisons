Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is at fault for telling a 6th-grade boy he smells. The situation is that the student has bad body odor, the teacher tried to discreetly inform the mom who basically said they can handle it but the kid doesn't. Then the teacher told the kid directly that people don't want to sit next to him and gave hygiene advice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's approach. The mom was contacted first, which is good. The mom's response was dismissive but indicated they have the means to handle it. The teacher then approached the student directly. The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher now feels awful.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, the teacher's intention was to help the student. Body odor can be a real issue for a kid, affecting social interactions and self-esteem. The teacher tried to be discreet by informing the mom first. When that didn't help, they addressed the student directly. The teacher's message was factual and focused on hygiene, not shaming the student but explaining the impact and giving practical advice. The student's reaction might be due to embarrassment or not knowing how to respond. The teacher's method seems appropriate, considering the age of the student and the need to address the issue without making the student feel bullied. So the answer is probably B, the teacher isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a better way? Like providing resources or working with the school counselor. But according to the given scenario, the teacher acted in a reasonable way.\n"
