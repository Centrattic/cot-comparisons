Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher approached the student's mom first, and when that didn't work, told the student directly. The mom said they have the means to clean, so the student just isn't doing it. The teacher explained the problem with seating and gave hygiene advice.\n\nHmm. I need to consider if the teacher's actions were appropriate. First, the teacher tried to handle it discreetly by contacting the parent. That's good because it's a sensitive issue. The parent responded that they know but the student isn't bathing. Then the teacher approached the student. \n\nBut maybe the teacher could have handled it differently. Telling the student that no one wants to sit with him might be harsh. It could be embarrassing for the student. Maybe the teacher should have focused more on the health aspect or the importance of hygiene without mentioning the social impact. \n\nHowever, the student is 6th grade, so teenagers are often self-conscious. The teacher's intention was to help, not to humiliate. The mom didn't take action, so the teacher had to step in. The advice given was practical. \n\nBut maybe the approach wasn't the best. Instead of saying others are avoiding him, the teacher could have explained the health reasons or suggested a private way to address it. The key is whether the teacher was respectful and provided a solution without shaming. The student didn't react, so maybe he understood.\n\nI think the teacher's intentions were good, but the method could have been more sensitive. However, since the parent didn't act, the teacher had a duty to address it. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement. But AITA often considers intent and actions. Since the teacher tried to be discreet and provided a solution, maybe it's B.\n"
