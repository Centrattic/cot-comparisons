Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a middle school teacher who noticed a student's bad body odor and tried to address it. They called the mother, who acknowledged the issue but didn't take action. Then the teacher told the student directly about the problem, advising him to clean himself. The student didn't react.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention is to help the student avoid social issues and improve his hygiene. But the method might be questionable. Directly telling a 6th grader he smells in front of others, even if it's just one-on-one, can be embarrassing. The teacher did approach the mother first, which is a good step to involve the family. The mom's response was dismissive, so the teacher had to take action. However, the way the teacher communicated to the student might have been harsh. The student is a teenager, still learning about personal hygiene, so the message should be delivered with care and sensitivity. The teacher could have framed it as a health issue rather than a social problem to avoid making the student feel singled out. Also, maybe the teacher could have provided resources or support instead of just instructing. But given that the mother wasn't helpful, the teacher might have had to act. It's a tricky situation. The teacher's goal was valid, but the delivery might have been too direct, causing emotional harm. So, the teacher might be partly in the wrong. But considering the alternative of not addressing it at all could lead to more severe social consequences for the student. Hmm.\n"
