Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, and the mom said they have the means but the kid doesn't bathe. Then the teacher told the student directly that his odor is causing seating issues and gave advice on hygiene.\n\nHmm. The teacher's intentions seem good\u2014they're trying to help the student, right? But maybe the way they did it was harsh. The student is a sixth grader; maybe he's already self-conscious. Telling him in front of others or even in a one-on-one could be embarrassing. The teacher mentioned the seating problem, which might have made the student feel singled out. Also, the mom's response was that they can bathe but he doesn't, so maybe there's a deeper issue. The teacher did approach the mom first, which is responsible, but the direct approach to the student might not have been the best method. It depends on if the teacher was respectful and private. The student didn't react, but that doesn't mean he's fine. Maybe the teacher should have used a more supportive method, like encouraging hygiene without shaming him. But in terms of being wrong, was it necessary? The teacher is trying to help, but the method could be questioned. So the answer might be that the teacher isn't entirely wrong, but could have handled it better. So answer B, but maybe with a note. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the options are A or B. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The teacher's actions were to address a problem that was affecting the student's social interactions. However, the method might be considered harsh. But if the teacher acted in good faith and the intent was to help, maybe they aren't in the wrong. So answer B: No.\n"
