Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a middle school teacher who addressed a student's body odor. The student's mom was already aware and said they have the means to clean up, but the kid isn't doing it. The teacher told the student that others don't want to sit next to him and gave hygiene advice. The user feels bad because the student just nodded and left.\n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? Well, their intention was to help, right? The mom is aware, but maybe the approach could have been more sensitive. The teacher mentioned that seating is an issue because of the smell, which could make the student feel embarrassed. Instead of focusing on the social repercussions, maybe they could have offered more support or resources. However, the teacher did contact the mom first, which is the right step. Then, when the mom said they can take care of it, the teacher tried to inform the student respectfully. The advice given is practical, but the way it was delivered might not have been the most supportive. The student didn't react, so maybe the message got through, but the emotional impact isn't clear. In a school setting, teachers have a responsibility to address such issues, but they should balance honesty with compassion. So, while the teacher's actions aren't malicious, the method could be questioned. But overall, they're trying to do the right thing by involving parents and the student. So, not in the wrong, but maybe could improve.\n"
