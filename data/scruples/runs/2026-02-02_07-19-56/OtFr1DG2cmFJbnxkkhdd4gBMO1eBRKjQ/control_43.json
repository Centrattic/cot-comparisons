Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a middle school teacher who noticed a student smells bad and tried to address it. The teacher called the mom, who said she knows but the kid doesn't bathe. Then the teacher told the student directly about his odor and suggested he clean himself.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention seems good. They wanted to help the student, both for his hygiene and maybe to prevent teasing or social issues. The mom's response was that they have the means but the kid refuses. So the teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first, which is a good step. Then, when that didn't work, approached the student directly.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way? Maybe the teacher should have involved the school counselor or social worker instead of handling it alone? Or maybe the approach was too direct, making the student feel embarrassed? The student didn't react, just nodded and left. Maybe that's a sign of being upset but not showing it.\n\nAlso, the teacher mentioned that finding a seat was hard because no one wanted to sit next to him. That's a bit harsh. Maybe the teacher should have focused more on the health and social aspects rather than the seating issue. But the student's hygiene could be affecting his interactions with peers, so the teacher has a point in wanting to address it.\n\nThe mom's response indicates possible neglect or the student's own habits. The teacher's actions were meant to help, but maybe the method could have been more sensitive. However, the teacher did approach it discreetly first. So, is the teacher in the wrong or not?\n\nConsidering all factors: the teacher's intentions were to help, tried to be discreet, the mom wasn't helpful, and the student needed guidance. The teacher gave practical advice. It seems like the teacher isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
