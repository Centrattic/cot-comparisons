Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a middle school teacher who noticed a student has bad body odor. They contacted the mom, who acknowledged the issue but didn't seem to have a solution. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and told him about the smell and how it's affecting seating, and gave hygiene advice. The student didn't react.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to address the issue discreetly, which is important. They tried to involve the parent first, which is the right step. The mom's response was noncommittal, so maybe the student's home situation isn't ideal. The teacher then approached the student directly with specific advice, which is constructive. But the student didn't respond emotionally, so maybe he's used to it or it's a sensitive topic.\n\nIs the teacher wrong? Well, they tried to be kind and offer solutions. However, body odor can sometimes be a sign of a medical issue, like poor hygiene or an underlying condition. The teacher might not have considered that. Also, telling the student that no one wants to sit with him could be hurtful. But the alternative\u2014letting the student suffer from bullying or social isolation isn't good either.\n\nThe teacher's approach was honest but maybe could have been more empathetic. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, but the intent was to help. Since the mom didn't take action, the teacher had to step in. So overall, the teacher isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
