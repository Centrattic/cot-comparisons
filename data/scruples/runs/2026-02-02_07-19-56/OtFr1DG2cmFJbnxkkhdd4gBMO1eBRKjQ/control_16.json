Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, which is good because they tried to address it discreetly. The mom said they have the means to shower but the kid isn't doing it. Then the teacher told the student directly, explaining the issue and giving advice on hygiene.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the teacher's approach. They didn't just publicly shame the student; they spoke to his mom first and then had a private conversation. The teacher's intention was to help, not to embarrass. The student didn't react, but that doesn't mean the teacher was wrong. It's possible the student was embarrassed but didn't show it. The teacher's advice was practical and necessary for the student's well-being and social integration. There's no indication the teacher used harsh language or made fun of the student. So, I think the teacher acted appropriately. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
