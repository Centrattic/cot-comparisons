Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has body odor, and the teacher tried to handle it by talking to the mom first, who said they have running water and he can bathe but doesn't. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and told him directly about the odor and gave advice on hygiene.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the teacher) is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate if the teacher's approach was appropriate. \n\nFirst, handling sensitive issues like body odor in a student is tricky. The teacher tried to be discreet by contacting the mom first, which is good. The mom's response indicated that there's no lack of resources, so the issue might be more about the student's habits. \n\nThen, the teacher addressed the student directly. The way it was done\u2014telling him that seating is difficult because of the smell\u2014could be seen as embarrassing the student even if done privately. However, the alternative is letting the student suffer in silence or face bullying from peers, which is also harmful. \n\nThe teacher's intention seems to be helpful, to inform the student about the issue so he can take action. But the method could have been more compassionate. Maybe focusing on health and well-being rather than the social consequences (like not wanting to sit next to him) might have been better. \n\nAlso, the student's lack of reaction might indicate shock, embarrassment, or understanding. The teacher might not have provided emotional support or offered further assistance, which could be part of the problem. \n\nIn terms of whether the teacher is in the wrong, schools have a responsibility to address hygiene issues to protect all students' well-being. Direct intervention is necessary, but the approach could have been more sensitive. However, the teacher did act discreetly and privately, which is appropriate. \n\nI think the key here is that while the teacher's intention was good, the way the message was delivered might have been harsh, contributing to the student's possible embarrassment. But given the circumstances, the teacher might not be entirely in the wrong because the issue needed addressing. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that a more empathetic approach could have been better.\n"
