Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a middle school teacher who confronted a student about his body odor. The teacher called the mom first, which is a good step. The mom acknowledged the issue and said they have the means to shower but the kid isn't doing it. Then the teacher directly told the student that others don't want to sit with him and instructed him to clean himself.\n\nHmm, the teacher's intention was to help, but maybe the approach was harsh. Sixth graders are sensitive. Telling a kid he's so smelly that no one wants to sit next to him could be really embarrassing. Even though the teacher meant well, the message about social exclusion might be more damaging than constructive. The mom might already be aware, but the direct approach to the kid could have caused more emotional harm. The teacher could have suggested a more positive reinforcement, like offering help or resources without shaming. So maybe the teacher is in the wrong for the way they communicated the issue.\n"
