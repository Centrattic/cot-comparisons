Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is at fault here. The teacher's student has a bad smell, and they approached both the mom and the student directly.\n\nFirst, the teacher called the mom, which makes sense because it's a parental responsibility. The mom says she knows but the kid isn't doing it. Then the teacher talks to the student, explaining the issue and giving advice. The student is 6th grade, so around 11-12 years old. At that age, kids might not realize how they smell or might be embarrassed. The teacher's approach was to be discreet, which is good. They didn't make a public scene, which could have been hurtful. \n\nBut maybe the teacher could have handled it differently? Like, using a different approach to avoid embarrassing the student. However, the student didn't react, so maybe he already knew and was used to it. The key here is whether the teacher overstepped. The advice given was practical and necessary for the student's well-being and social interactions. The teacher's intention was to help, not to shame. \n\nThe mom's response suggests they have the means to address the issue, but the child isn't following through. The teacher's role is to support the child's learning environment, which includes addressing hygiene if it's affecting others. So, I think the teacher did the right thing. They were direct but kind, and the problem needed to be addressed. The answer should be B, not at fault.\n"
