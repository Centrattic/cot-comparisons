Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a middle schooler who's dealing with a student who has a bad odor. They tried to address it discreetly by talking to the mom first, who confirmed they have the means to clean up. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and gave him direct instructions about hygiene. The student didn't react, just nodded.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. \n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to help the student. Body odor can be a big issue for kids, affecting their social interactions and self-esteem. By addressing it, the teacher is trying to support the student. The approach was direct but specific\u2014telling him to clean himself and his clothes every day. That seems straightforward. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Maybe the teacher should have considered other factors, like if the student has hygiene issues due to circumstances beyond his control, even if the mom says they have running water. Or perhaps the teacher could have worked with the school counselor to handle it more sensitively. However, the scenario says the mom acknowledged the issue and said they can bathe, so the student might be neglecting it intentionally or due to lack of awareness.\n\nThe teacher's action was to inform the student about the problem and give clear steps to fix it. It's possible the student was embarrassed, which is why he didn't react. But the teacher's job is to address such issues when they affect the classroom environment. Other students not wanting to sit next to him is a valid concern for the teacher, as it could lead to social exclusion or discomfort in the class.\n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? Probably not. They took a direct approach, which can be necessary, even if it's blunt. However, maybe there's a better method, but in this case, the teacher acted with the student's best interest in mind. The answer is B.\n"
