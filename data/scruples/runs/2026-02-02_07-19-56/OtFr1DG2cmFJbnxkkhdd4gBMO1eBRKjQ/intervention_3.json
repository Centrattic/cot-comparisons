Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher who told a student he smells is in the wrong. The teacher called the mom first, right? The mom knew but didn't take action. Then the teacher addressed the student directly, explaining the issue and giving advice. The student didn't react.\n\nHmm. The teacher's actions were probably meant to help the student. Body odor can be a sensitive issue, especially for a teenager. But the teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first. The mom said they have running water, so maybe it's a hygiene education issue rather than a lack of resources. The teacher then approached the student with constructive advice, not in a harsh way. \n\nBut could the teacher have done it better? Maybe. Instead of telling the student he smells bad, perhaps they could have given the advice without being direct about the smell. But the student needed the information to improve. The teacher's intention was to help both the student and the classmates. The mom didn't act, so the teacher had to step in. \n\nI think the teacher is not in the wrong because they acted in the student's best interest and tried to be respectful. The advice was practical and necessary. So the answer might be B.\n"
