Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the middle school teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher approached the issue because the student's body odor was affecting the classroom environment. They even called the mother first to be discreet. The mom acknowledged the problem and mentioned they have the means to clean but the boy isn't doing it. Then the teacher spoke directly to the student, explaining the issue and giving advice on hygiene.\n\nI need to consider the teacher's approach. They didn't publicly shame the student, which is important. They tried to handle it privately, first with the parent and then the student. The teacher's intention seems to be to help the student fit in and maintain personal hygiene, which is a common concern in middle school. However, the student didn't react, just nodded and left. The teacher feels awful about it afterward, which shows they care about the student's feelings.\n\nNow, is the teacher wrong? Well, the situation is sensitive because body odor can be a sign of neglect or other issues. The teacher's approach was direct but private, which is the right way to handle it. Publicly embarrassing a student would definitely be wrong, but here the teacher tried to be discreet. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, like involving school counselors or providing hygiene resources if the student can't afford them. But the teacher did what they could with the information given. The mother's response suggests the issue isn't about resources but the student's habits. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
