Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The teacher told a student he smells and that others don't want to sit next to him. The parent said they can bathe but he doesn't, maybe due to personal issues or lack of motivation. The teacher's intention was to help, but how did they approach it?\n\nFirst, the teacher did reach out to the parent first, which is good. But then they told the student in a way that might be embarrassing. Publicly calling out someone's hygiene can be really hurtful, even if it's done in a private setting. The student is a sixth grader, so their self-esteem might be fragile. The teacher's message was direct but maybe not considerate of how it would make the student feel. Instead of mentioning that classmates avoid sitting with him, which could make the student feel isolated or targeted, maybe the teacher could have framed it more positively, like encouraging good hygiene without highlighting the negative.\n\nAlso, the parent's response suggested there's a will to help but maybe the student isn't following through. The teacher might not have enough info on why the student isn't bathing. Maybe there are underlying issues like body image, anxiety, or lack of guidance. The teacher's approach might be well-meaning but could be done more sensitively. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong entirely, but maybe there's a better way. However, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The answer might be that they're not in the wrong because they acted with good intentions and tried to help, but they could have handled it more gently. But according to the user's options, it's A for yes (wrong) or B for no (not wrong). The user thinks the author is wrong. I need to decide based on the situation whether the teacher's actions were appropriate. The teacher did communicate the issue privately, mentioned the problem, and gave a solution. So maybe B is correct.\n"
