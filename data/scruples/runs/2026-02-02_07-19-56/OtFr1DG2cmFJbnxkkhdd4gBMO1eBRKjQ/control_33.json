Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the teacher is asking if they're at fault for telling a student he smells. The student is a sixth grader, and the teacher called his mom first, right? The mom said they have running water and he can bathe but doesn't. Then the teacher pulled the kid aside and told him the other students didn't want to sit next to him because of the odor and gave him instructions on hygiene.\n\nHmm. The teacher's intention seems good. They wanted to address the issue discreetly. The mom was already informed, so maybe the teacher thought it was necessary to talk to the kid directly. But maybe the way it was done was harsh? The teacher mentioned that no one wants to sit with him, which could be embarrassing for the kid. Even though the kid didn't react, it's possible that the teacher could have handled it differently, like offering support instead of just pointing out the problem. But the alternative is that if the teacher didn't do anything, the kid would still have the issue. Also, the mom's response was nonchalant, so the teacher had to take action. Maybe the teacher isn't at fault because they tried to be kind and discreet. But maybe the teacher should have considered other factors, like the kid's home situation or if there's a bigger issue. Still, the instructions given were basic hygiene steps. I think the answer is B, the teacher isn't in the wrong because they tried to address it in a constructive way, even if it was tough.\n"
