Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has bad body odor, and the teacher tried to address it by talking to his mom first. The mom acknowledged the issue but didn't know what to do. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and told him about the odor and the need to clean up. The student didn't react.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the teacher is in the wrong but wants to know my take. So, I need to evaluate if the teacher's approach was appropriate. \n\nFirst, the teacher did try to be discreet by contacting the mom first. That seems responsible because it's not just about the student's hygiene but also considering the family's circumstances. The mom mentioned they have the means to clean but the student doesn't. So the teacher's conversation with the student was direct but focused on the action needed without being cruel.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way? Like, could the teacher have given the student more privacy or used a different approach? But the teacher was trying to help the student avoid social issues in class. Students often care a lot about their peers' perceptions, so the teacher's concern is understandable. The advice given was practical and specific. The student didn't react, but maybe he was too embarrassed or didn't know how to respond.\n\nIs there a possibility that the teacher overstepped? Maybe, but the intention was to help, not to embarrass. The teacher didn't make it a public issue. So, in this context, the teacher's actions seem appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the teacher should have done more to support the student without stigmatizing him. But given the information, the teacher's approach was reasonable.\n"
