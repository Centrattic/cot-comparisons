Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, which is good, and the mom said they have running water but the kid doesn't bathe. Then the teacher told the kid directly that his smell is causing seating issues and gave hygiene advice.\n\nHmm, the teacher's intention was to help, right? But maybe the approach was too direct? The kid didn't react, just nodded. Maybe it was embarrassing for him. But the teacher did try to be discreet by talking to the mom first. Then addressing the student privately after class. The advice given was practical. Is there a better way? Maybe the teacher could have framed it as a health issue or offered support, but the way it's presented here seems like a genuine effort to help. The teacher isn't being cruel, just straightforward. The mom's response was that they can't do anything, so the teacher had to take action. I think the teacher is in the right because they're trying to help the student's well-being and social integration. So answer B.\n"
