Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, right? The mom said she knows, but the kid doesn't want to shower. Then the teacher pulled the kid aside and told him about the odor and the seating issue. The kid just nodded.\n\nHmm. So, the teacher's actions were meant to be helpful. Body odor can be really uncomfortable for others, and the teacher tried to address it discreetly. The mom seems aware but maybe doesn't know how to handle it. The teacher gave practical advice: wash hair, face, body, clothes, and wear clean clothes daily. That's standard hygiene advice.\n\nBut the kid is a sixth grader, so maybe he's going through puberty and not aware of the changes. The teacher's approach was direct but in a private setting. The question is whether the teacher overstepped. On one hand, the teacher is trying to help the student avoid social issues. On the other hand, maybe the teacher should have waited for the mom to handle it, but the mom didn't take action. The teacher's job is also to create a comfortable learning environment for all students. So maybe the teacher isn't in the wrong here. But some might argue that it's a sensitive topic and should be handled differently. However, given the context, the teacher acted with good intentions and tried to be discreet. So probably answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
