Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the middle school teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student's odor is affecting his classmates, and the teacher tried to contact the mom first. The mom said they have running water and the kid can bathe but doesn't. Then the teacher pulled the kid aside and explained the issue with seating and gave hygiene advice.\n\nSo, the teacher's actions were to address a problem that's affecting the classroom environment. The student's bad smell is making it hard for others to sit next to him, which could lead to social issues or even bullying. The teacher tried to handle it discreetly by talking to the mom first, which is good because it shows they considered the family's role. When the mom didn't resolve it, the teacher approached the student directly. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The teacher's intent was to help the student, not embarrass him. 2) They gave practical advice about hygiene. 3) They tried to be respectful by not making it a public issue. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the teacher shouldn't have addressed the student directly if the parent didn't act. But since the teacher already tried the parent and it didn't work, intervening directly makes sense. Also, in a school setting, teachers have a responsibility to maintain a respectful and safe environment for all students. \n\nThe student's reaction was to nod and leave without a response, which might indicate he's upset but didn't react openly. The teacher felt awful afterward, which shows concern for the student's feelings. But overall, the action was necessary to address a real problem (classmates avoiding him) and promoting good hygiene is a positive step. \n\nSo, I think the teacher isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
