Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, which is good. The mom said they can bathe but he doesn't. Then the teacher talked to the student, explaining the issue and giving advice. The student didn't react.\n\nHmm. The question is about whether the teacher did the right thing. The key points here are the teacher's approach. The teacher tried to be discreet by contacting the mom first. When that didn't help, they spoke to the student directly, focusing on the behavior and providing a solution. The student might be dealing with personal issues, like maybe lack of hygiene products or personal habits. The teacher's intention was to help, not to embarrass. However, there's a chance the student felt humiliated. But the teacher gave constructive advice, which is positive. The mom's response indicated that there's no lack of resources, so the issue might be more about the student's habits. The teacher's actions were aimed at creating a better environment for everyone. I think the teacher is not in the wrong. They handled it respectfully. So the answer is B.\n"
