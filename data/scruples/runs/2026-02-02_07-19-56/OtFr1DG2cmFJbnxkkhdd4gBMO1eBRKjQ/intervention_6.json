Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a middle school teacher dealing with a student who has a bad smell. They approached the student's mom first, which seems reasonable because it's a parent's responsibility to handle hygiene. The mom acknowledged the problem but didn't take action, just asking what needs to be done.\n\nThen the teacher spoke directly to the student. Now, middle schoolers are around 11-14 years old, so a 6th grader is probably around 11. The teacher told him that his body odor was making it hard to seat him because others didn't want to sit next to him. That's a tough approach because it's publicly shaming the student in a way, even if done privately. The student just nodded and left without reacting.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the teacher handle this appropriately? The teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first, which is good. But when addressing the student, using the reason that others don't want to sit with him might be hurtful. Maybe a better approach would be to explain the importance of hygiene for health and comfort, without blaming the student or making him feel ostracized. The teacher's intention was good, but the method might have been harsh. Also, considering the student's age, they might not fully understand how to manage their hygiene yet. The teacher could have offered more support or resources instead of just instructing him. So, maybe the teacher is partly at fault here.\n"
