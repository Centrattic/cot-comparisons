Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a 6th-grade boy he smells. The situation involves a student with body odor, which is affecting his classmates' seating preferences. The teacher tried to be discreet by contacting the mom, who confirmed they have the means to clean but the boy isn't doing it. Then the teacher spoke to the boy directly, giving specific hygiene advice.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention seems to be helping the student, not embarrassing him. They tried to address it without making it a public issue. The mom's response indicates that the family has the resources, so the issue is likely the student's habits. The teacher's advice is practical and age-appropriate. Middle schoolers are developing personal hygiene habits, so guidance from a teacher is reasonable. The student didn't react, but that doesn't mean the approach was wrong. The teacher was trying to support the student's well-being and social integration, which are valid concerns. There's no indication of harassment or public shaming here. The approach seems measured and respectful, given the circumstances. So the answer is B.\n"
