Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, which seems like a good step. The mom responded that they have the means to clean but the boy isn't doing it. Then the teacher told the student directly, using the class seating issue as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. They probably wanted to help the student, both socially and hygienically. The student's odor is affecting his interactions with others, so addressing it could prevent bullying or social isolation. The teacher approached the parent first, which is appropriate, and when that didn't resolve it, took direct action with the student.\n\nBut wait, was the way the teacher communicated it appropriate? They mentioned other students not wanting to sit with him. That might make the student feel embarrassed or singled out. However, the teacher also gave practical advice on hygiene. Maybe the method could be improved, but the intent is good.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the teacher should have handled it differently, like offering support or resources instead of just telling him off. But given the situation, the teacher's actions seem reasonable. The student didn't react, but that doesn't mean the teacher was wrong. They were trying to help the student fit in better, which is a valid concern.\n\nAlso, the teacher didn't spread the issue beyond the parent and student, keeping it confidential. That's a positive. The advice given is factual and necessary. So overall, I think the teacher is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
