Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is asking if they're at fault for telling a student he smells. The situation is that a 6th-grade boy has body odor so bad the teacher can't seat him next to others. The teacher called the mom, who said they have water and he can bathe but doesn't. Then the teacher told the boy directly that his smell made seating hard and advised him to clean himself.\n\nFirst, the teacher tried to handle it discreetly by contacting the mom first. The mom didn't act, so the teacher addressed the student. But was the way she addressed him appropriate? The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher now feels awful. \n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. From a professional standpoint, teachers are responsible for students' well-being and education. Body odor can affect a student's social interactions and mental health. However, the approach matters. Telling a student he \"smells\" directly might be harsh, even if the intent is helpful. It could affect his self-esteem, especially in middle school. The teacher might have considered other methods, like using a more supportive approach or involving the mom more actively. However, given that the mom was aware and didn't act, maybe the teacher had to step in. But the way she did it could be seen as insensitive. So, the answer might depend on the method rather than the action itself. If the teacher's intention was to help and she tried to be kind, maybe not at fault. But the direct comment might be too blunt. So, maybe the answer is A (yes) because the delivery was harsh and could harm the student's feelings, even if the intent was good. Alternatively, B (no) if the teacher's actions were necessary to address the issue when the parent didn't help.\n"
