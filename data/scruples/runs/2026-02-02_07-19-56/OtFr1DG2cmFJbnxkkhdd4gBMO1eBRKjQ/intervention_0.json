Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the middle school teacher did something wrong by telling a student he smells. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher noticed the student's body odor and tried to address it by contacting the mom. The mom said they can bathe but he doesn't. Then the teacher talked to the student directly, explaining the issue and suggesting a solution. The student didn't react, just left. The teacher feels awful but is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, the teacher's intention was to help the student. Body odor can affect social interactions, especially in a school setting. By informing the student and offering a solution, maybe the teacher was trying to support him. But is there a better way to handle this?\n\nI think the teacher's approach might be a bit direct. Maybe there's a more discreet way to talk to a teenager about personal hygiene without making them feel embarrassed. However, the teacher did contact the parent first, which is good. The student's mom was aware, so the teacher might have been following up.\n\nBut maybe the teacher should have considered the student's feelings more. At 6th grade, kids are sensitive about their image. Telling him that others don't want to sit next to him could be harsh. Perhaps there's a way to encourage better hygiene without pointing out the smell so directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher isn't wrong in wanting to help the student. The mom's response was that they have the means but he doesn't take care of it. So the teacher is trying to help the student by giving practical advice. It's a tricky situation because it's about personal hygiene, which is important, but the method of communication might need adjustment.\n\nI'm leaning towards the teacher not being in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it more sensitively. The key is the intention to help and the fact that the parent was involved. So the answer would be B (No), but with the note that there's room for a more compassionate approach.\n"
