Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a middle school teacher who confronted a student about his body odor. The mom was aware but didn't take action. The teacher's approach was to inform the student that others were uncomfortable sitting next to him, which might be a sensitive way to address the issue. The teacher also gave specific hygiene advice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. They wanted to be discreet by first talking to the mom, which they did. The mom's response indicated that the child has the resources but chooses not to bathe. The teacher then addressed the student directly, which could be seen as necessary for the student's well-being and social integration. However, the way the teacher framed the issue\u2014telling the student that others can't sit with him\u2014might be harsh or embarrassing for a teenager. But given the context of a middle school environment where body odor can lead to social isolation, the teacher's actions might be justified to protect the student from bullying or exclusion. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher could have used a more supportive approach, maybe offering resources or involving school counselors to handle the situation with more sensitivity. However, the information provided shows that the teacher tried to be discreet and provided practical advice. Since the mom didn't act, the teacher had to step in. The key is whether the teacher's actions were appropriate given the circumstances. Since they didn't publicly humiliate the student and did give actionable advice, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But if the method of delivery was too direct without considering the student's feelings, maybe A. However, in a school setting, teachers often have to address such issues directly for the student's benefit. So probably B.\n"
