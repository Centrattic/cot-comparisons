Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a middle school teacher who told a student he smells bad. The parent knows but the student isn't taking action. The teacher tried to inform the parent, but the mom says they have facilities but the kid just doesn't use them. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and directly told him about his odor and the seating issue. The student didn't react.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intent is probably to help the student. Body odor can cause social issues, and the teacher is trying to support the student's well-being. However, approaching the student directly might be a bit harsh. Even though the parent isn't acting, the teacher might have considered other methods first, like offering resources or involving school counselors. But the student's situation is likely affecting his social interactions and self-esteem. The teacher's approach was direct but maybe necessary since the parent isn't addressing it. However, the way it's framed\u2014saying it's hard to seat him\u2014could be hurtful. Maybe a more supportive approach would be better. Still, the teacher is trying to help. So, is the teacher in the wrong? Hmm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intent is to help, but maybe the method could be improved. But according to the options, the user thinks A (wrong) but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the teacher crossed a line. Since it was done with the intention to help and the student's welfare, but perhaps could have been handled more sensitively, maybe the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
