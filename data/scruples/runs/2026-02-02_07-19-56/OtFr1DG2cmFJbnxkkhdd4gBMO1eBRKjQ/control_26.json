Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has a bad odor, the teacher tried to contact the mom, who said they have the means to clean up but the kid doesn't. Then the teacher told the kid directly about his smell and the problem of seating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher's job is to create a safe and comfortable environment for all students. Body odor can be distracting and uncomfortable for others, so the teacher has a responsibility here. The teacher tried to address it discreetly by contacting the mom first, which is a good step. The mom didn't seem to have a solution, so the teacher had to take action.\n\nThe student is 6th grade, so around 11-12 years old. That's a time when kids are developing hygiene habits, and this could be a learning opportunity. The teacher's message was practical and non-judgmental, focusing on the need for cleanliness for everyone's comfort. The teacher didn't shame the student but gave specific advice on how to address it. \n\nHowever, maybe the approach could have been even more empathetic. The teacher mentioned the seating issue, which might make the student feel excluded. But given the mom's lack of action, the teacher might not have a choice. The teacher's intentions seem good\u2014wanting to help the student and the class. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, they tried to handle it sensitively. The student's reaction was to nod and leave, which might be a sign of understanding rather than being hurt. The teacher's actions were aimed at solving a real problem. So probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
