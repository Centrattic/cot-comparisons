Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the teacher noticed a student's bad odor and tried to address it by talking to the mom, who said they have the means to clean up but the kid isn't doing it. Then the teacher spoke to the kid directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is a middle school teacher, dealing with a 6th grader. Body odor can be a problem during puberty due to hormones. The teacher's intention seems to be to help the student, not to embarrass him. They mentioned the issue to the mom first, which is the right step. The mom acknowledged the problem but didn't know what to do, so the teacher took the next step by talking to the student.\n\nThe teacher approached the student discreetly, focusing on the practical aspect: suggesting hygiene steps. The student didn't react, just nodded. The teacher now feels awful but is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFrom a social and educational standpoint, teachers have a responsibility to address issues that affect the classroom environment. Bad odor can be isolating for the student and disruptive. The approach here seems to be supportive rather than shaming. The teacher didn't make a public announcement but had a private conversation, which is appropriate.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Could the teacher have handled it differently? Maybe, but the intent was to help. The mom's response indicated they have the resources, so the problem is the student's habits. The teacher's advice is practical and necessary for the student's well-being and social integration.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the teacher isn't in the wrong. They acted in the student's best interest in a discreet and supportive manner.\n"
