Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The teacher is asking if they're at fault for telling a student he smells. The student is a sixth grader, so around 11-12 years old. The teacher called the mom first, which seems like a good step to be discreet. The mom acknowledged the issue and said they have the means but the boy doesn't take care of it. Then the teacher pulled the boy aside and told him the problem, explaining that others don't want to sit near him and gave advice on hygiene.\n\nHmm. Is the teacher wrong? Well, the teacher's intention was to help the student, right? Body odor can be really isolating, and the teacher is trying to prevent the student from being ostracized. But how did they approach it? They told him that no one wants to sit with him because of his smell. That might make the student feel embarrassed or humiliated, especially in front of others. However, the teacher did it privately, after class, and gave specific advice. The mom's response was to let the teacher know they have the resources, so the problem is the boy's habits. \n\nBut maybe the teacher could have handled it differently. Instead of focusing on the negative reaction from peers, maybe emphasizing the importance of hygiene for health and comfort. Also, the teacher might not have considered if there are other factors, like maybe the student has a medical condition or is going through a tough time. But the mom said it's about not following through with basic hygiene. \n\nThe teacher's actions were meant to be helpful, but maybe the way they communicated it could be seen as harsh. However, given the situation, the teacher was trying to be kind and proactive. The student didn't react, which might be because he was too embarrassed to respond. \n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher might not be in the wrong. They tried to address the issue discreetly and provided solutions. But there's a balance between being honest and being compassionate. The teacher could have used a more supportive tone. Still, the core issue is the student's hygiene affecting his social interactions, and the teacher's intervention was to mitigate that. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could be improved.\n"
