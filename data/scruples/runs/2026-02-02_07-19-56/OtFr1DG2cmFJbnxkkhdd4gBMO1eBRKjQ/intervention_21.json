Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has bad body odor, and the teacher tried to address it by talking to the mom first. The mom knew but said they can bathe, but he doesn't. Then the teacher pulled the student aside and told him about the smell affecting seating and advised hygiene steps.\n\nHmm, so the teacher's intention was to help the student, right? But the student didn't react. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's the case.\n\nFirst, consider the teacher's actions. Teachers have a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment. Body odor can be a sensitive issue, especially for a teenager who might be self-conscious. The teacher approached it discreetly by talking to the mom first, which is good. Then addressing the student directly but in a private setting. The advice given was constructive, suggesting daily hygiene steps. \n\nBut maybe the way it was communicated could be a problem. Was the teacher's message respectful? The teacher mentioned that seating was difficult because no one wanted to sit with him. That might be harsh, as it could embarrass the student. Instead of focusing on others' reactions, maybe the teacher could have framed it as a personal health issue or offered support.\n\nAlso, the mom's response indicated that they have the means to clean but the student isn't doing it. The teacher might not have the authority or the right approach to enforce hygiene changes. It's possible that the student's hygiene issues could be due to other factors like lack of supplies, personal neglect, or even something like depression or lack of supervision. The teacher's approach might not address the root cause, but they did take steps to inform the parent and the student.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the teacher's intention was to help the student avoid bullying or social isolation. But the method might have been a bit direct. However, considering the student is 6th grade, which is around 11-12 years old, it's a time when personal hygiene becomes important. The teacher's advice is practical.\n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? Arguably, the approach could have been more supportive. Maybe offering resources or checking in with the student. But the action itself was to help the student, not to shame him. The mom was involved, so it's a collaborative effort. The student's lack of reaction might indicate he's used to it or embarrassed, but the teacher's intent was positive. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it more sensitively.\n"
