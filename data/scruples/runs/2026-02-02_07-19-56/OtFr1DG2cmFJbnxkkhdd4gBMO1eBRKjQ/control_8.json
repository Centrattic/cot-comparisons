Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, which seems reasonable. The mom knew but couldn't get the kid to bathe. Then the teacher talked to the student directly. The student didn't react. The question is whether the teacher did the right thing.\n\nFirst, body odor in a classroom setting can be disruptive. Kids are sensitive about such things, so the teacher probably had to address it. The teacher tried to be discreet by contacting the mom first, which is good. The mom's response indicated they have the resources but the student isn't following through. So the teacher's next step was to talk to the student. \n\nBut maybe the teacher could have approached it more delicately. Telling a kid they smell can be embarrassing. Maybe using a different approach, like a private conversation with support, or providing hygiene resources? But the teacher's intent was to help, not to humiliate. The student just nodded, so maybe he understood. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? If the teacher acted in good faith and tried to handle it discreetly, then probably not. However, there's a line between addressing a problem and making a student feel singled out. The key factors here are the teacher's intent, the method of communication, and whether there were alternative solutions. The teacher might not be in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. So answer B, No.\n"
