Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The teacher is asking if they're at fault for telling a student he smells. The student is a 6th grader, so around 11-12 years old. The teacher approached the mom first, which is a good step. The mom knew but couldn't get the kid to bathe. Then the teacher talked to the student directly, explaining the odor issue and giving advice. The student didn't react, just nodded.\n\nHmm. The teacher's intention was to address the problem discreetly. But is it wrong to point out body odor to a kid? Maybe the way it was said? The teacher did involve the parent first, which is appropriate. They also gave practical advice instead of just criticizing. But maybe the student felt embarrassed, even if he didn't react. However, the teacher's concern is valid because the student's odor is affecting the classroom environment\u2014others don't want to sit next to him. \n\nThe key points: Did the teacher handle it appropriately? They didn't make it a public issue, went to the parent first, then communicated with the student in a private setting. The advice given was constructive. Even though the student might feel embarrassed, the teacher's duty is to manage the classroom and support the student's well-being. So maybe the teacher is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
