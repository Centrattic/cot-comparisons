Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher approached the student's mom first, and when that didn't resolve the issue, she spoke directly to the student. The student didn't react, just nodded.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention seems to be to help. She tried to handle it discreetly by contacting the mother first. The mom acknowledged the problem but didn't take action. Then the teacher addressed the student directly, giving practical advice. She also mentioned the social impact, like seating in class, which might be a way to explain the consequences without being harsh.\n\nBut is there a problem here? Well, middle schoolers can be sensitive, and body odor might be due to various reasons\u2014hygiene issues, maybe lack of resources, or even medical conditions. The teacher did involve the parent first, which is good. The student's mom says they have the means to clean, so it's more about the student's habits. The teacher's approach is direct but practical, focusing on what he can do. She didn't mock or humiliate him publicly, which is important. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, but based on the information, she seems to have acted appropriately. So probably the answer is B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
