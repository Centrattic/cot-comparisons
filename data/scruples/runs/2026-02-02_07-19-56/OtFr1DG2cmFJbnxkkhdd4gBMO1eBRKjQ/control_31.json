Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher called the mom first, right? The mom said they have running water and the kid doesn't bathe. Then the teacher spoke to the student, explaining the problem and how to fix it.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the teacher did the right thing. Well, the teacher tried to handle it discreetly by contacting the parent first. The mom was aware but maybe couldn't enforce it. Then the teacher approached the student directly, giving advice on hygiene. The student didn't react, just nodded.\n\nIs the teacher wrong here? Well, the student's hygiene is affecting his classmates and his own comfort. The teacher's goal is to help the student, not to shame him. But the way it's phrased, the teacher told the student that it was hard to seat him because no one wanted to sit with him. That might be a bit harsh. Maybe there's a more compassionate way to approach it without embarrassing the kid in front of others, even if it's just a private conversation.\n\nBut the teacher did speak to the parent first, which is important. Maybe the student is unaware of his own smell, especially if he's a middle schooler. So the teacher's intent was to help. However, the method of telling the student that no one wants to sit with him might be unkind. It could make the student feel isolated or humiliated. Maybe suggesting ways to improve hygiene without mentioning the social impact would be better. But the teacher did offer solutions.\n\nSo is the teacher in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the teacher is trying to help. On the other, the approach might be too direct. But given that the parent is aware and the teacher is providing solutions, maybe the teacher isn't in the wrong. The key is intent and approach. If the teacher's method was harsh, but the intent was good, then maybe not the teacher's fault. Alternatively, if there's a better way to handle it, but the teacher did what they thought was right, then it's not their fault. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could be improved. However, since the user is asking a yes or no, the answer is B.\n"
