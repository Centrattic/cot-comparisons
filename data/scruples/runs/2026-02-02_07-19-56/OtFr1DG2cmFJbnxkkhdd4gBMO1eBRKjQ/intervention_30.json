Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The teacher approached the student directly and also talked to the mom. The mom knows about the issue and says they have running water, so it's about the student not washing. The teacher told the student that he needs to clean himself and his clothes daily.\n\nHmm, the teacher's intention was to help, right? The student is 6th grade, so around 11-12 years old. That's a time when hygiene might still be something they're learning. The teacher tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first and then the student. But maybe the way it was communicated to the student was harsh? Like, saying it's hard to find him a seat because others don't want to sit with him\u2014that could be embarrassing for the student, especially if it's true. But if the mom has acknowledged the problem and the student isn't following through, the teacher has a responsibility to address it.\n\nWait, but the teacher's method\u2014saying others don't want to sit with him\u2014could be cruel. It's using peer pressure as a motivator. Maybe the student is self-conscious already. However, the alternative is not addressing it, which could lead to social issues for the student. The teacher did give direct advice on hygiene steps, which is helpful. The mom's response was that she knows, so maybe the teacher did the right thing by involving both parents and the student.\n\nBut is the teacher in the wrong? The user thinks yes, but I'm not sure. The teacher acted in the student's best interest, tried to be discreet, and gave actionable advice. The mom's responsibility is there, but the teacher can't be expected to handle it alone. The key point might be if the teacher's approach was respectful. Telling the student others don't want to sit with him might be hurtful, but if it's the truth, is that necessary? Maybe the teacher could have framed it differently, like focusing on health and well-being instead of peer reactions. But overall, the teacher is trying to help, so maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, the method could be questioned. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the teacher's actions were meant to address a real issue and involve the parent, it's probably B.\n"
