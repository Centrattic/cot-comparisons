Really bad. Worse than \"Who's kid shit their diaper?\" but not as bad as \"Oh dammit, I left that smoothie bottle in the car over the weekend!\"\n\nI called his mom in an attempt to be discreet and her response was essentially \"yeah I know what would you like me to do?\" Mom says they have running water and he can bathe, but he doesn't.\n\nI pulled him aside after class and told him that because of his body odor, it was difficult to find him a seat in class because no one wanted to sit with him. I told him he needed to wash his hair, face, body AND clothes with soap and water every day, and it was a good practice to wear clean clothing every day.\n\nI feel awful. He didn't react at all, just nodded and left.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student he smells. The situation is that the student has bad body odor, and the teacher tried to address it by talking to the mom first, who didn't seem to take it seriously. Then the teacher told the student directly, explaining the problem and giving advice on hygiene. The student didn't react much, just nodded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intent. The teacher's goal was to help the student, not to embarrass him. The method was direct but factual. The teacher also tried to be discreet by talking to the mom first, which is a good step. The mom's response was dismissive, so maybe the teacher felt it was necessary to address the student directly.\n\nBut then, is there a better way to handle this? Maybe the teacher could have given the student private advice without mentioning the seating issue? Because saying that others don't want to sit with him might cause embarrassment. But the student is in 6th grade, so maybe they understand the social implications. The teacher's advice about hygiene is practical and necessary, but the way it was delivered could be a factor. However, the student's mom wasn't helping, so the teacher had to step in.\n\nThe key points are: the teacher tried to be discreet, addressed a real problem that affects the student's social interactions, and provided actionable advice. The student's lack of reaction might be due to shock or understanding. The teacher's actions seem well-intentioned. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. Maybe the teacher should have used a more supportive approach without highlighting the social rejection aspect. But overall, the teacher is trying to help, so likely not in the wrong.\n"
