She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who wrote the situation is at fault for not wanting to spend hours on their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The parent argues that it's unnecessary because the child is too young and might just ruin it, plus they don't want her to feel pressured to spend so much time on her hair. The partner, on the other hand, wants the daughter to learn the routine now for when she's older and insists on being presentable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. At two, it's common for kids to be active and messy. Trying to maintain intricate hairstyles that take an hour would be impractical. The parent's concern about the child's well-being and avoiding unnecessary pressure makes sense. Also, it's reasonable to prioritize the child's comfort and natural play over adult grooming standards.\n\nThe partner's request might stem from wanting to instill good habits early, but maybe they're projecting their own standards onto a toddler. The parent is balancing practicality with the child's needs. They are already doing basic hair care, which is sufficient for a young child. The partner's constant complaints could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's causing stress without a valid reason for the child's age.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're making decisions based on what's appropriate for a 2-year-old. The partner might need to adjust their expectations. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
