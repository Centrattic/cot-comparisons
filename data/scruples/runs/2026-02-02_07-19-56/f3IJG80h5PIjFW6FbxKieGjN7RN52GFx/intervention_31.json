I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author has a 2-year-old daughter with thick ringlets. They mention that their own hair routine takes an hour a day and involves a lot of work. The partner wants the author to do the same routine for the daughter so she can learn to care for her hair when she's older. The author does some basic steps like washing and using products but refuses to spend hours on it. The partner is upset and insists on the routine for \"presentability,\" while the author thinks it's not necessary at this age and wants the daughter to feel beautiful without the pressure.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. Two years old is very young. At that age, kids are active, and their hair is likely to get messed up quickly regardless of how neatly it's done. The author's reasoning about the effort being wasteful makes sense. Also, the author's concern about the daughter not feeling like she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful is about promoting self-esteem without unnecessary pressure. That seems like a valid point.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's perspective is about teaching the daughter early how to care for her hair. But is that realistic for a toddler? Maybe the partner has good intentions but is not considering the practicality. Also, the partner is emphasizing \"presentable,\" which could be about societal expectations or personal preferences. However, the author is the one who actually knows their own routine's time and cost, and they are making a judgment based on their child's age and their own values.\n\nThe author is also explaining their reasoning, which suggests they aren't being negligent but are making a conscious choice. The partner's constant complaints and insistence might indicate that they're not respecting the author's perspective or the practical aspects of a toddler's lifestyle. The author's actions don't seem harmful, and they are trying to balance practicality with their values. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They are making a reasonable choice based on their daughter's age and their own understanding of what's appropriate. The partner's demands might stem from their own preferences but don't take into account the developmental stage of the child. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
