She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author explains that their own hair routine takes an hour and is time-consuming and costly. The partner wants them to do the same for the daughter so she learns proper hair care. The author does some basic steps but doesn't do the full routine, arguing it's unnecessary for a 2-year-old and doesn't want the daughter to feel pressured. The partner is upset about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Two years old is very young. At that age, children are active and messy, so maintaining a complex hair routine might be impractical. The author's reasoning about the time and effort seems valid. Also, the idea of not wanting the daughter to feel she needs to spend hours on her hair to be beautiful is a good point about self-esteem and body image.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's concern is about teaching the daughter proper hair care. But realistically, a 2-year-old isn't going to understand or benefit from that. The partner might be projecting their own habits or societal expectations onto the child. The partner's constant complaints and insistence could be seen as unreasonable given the child's age and the impracticality of the task.\n\nThe author is doing the basics: washing, brushing, leave-in products. That's sufficient for a toddler. The partner's demand for an hour-long routine is excessive. The author is also considering the daughter's well-being by not enforcing unnecessary routines. So, the author is not in the wrong here. The partner's expectations are unrealistic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
