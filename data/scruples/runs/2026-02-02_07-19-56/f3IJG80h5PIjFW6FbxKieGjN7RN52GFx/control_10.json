She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day because it takes too much time and effort. The partner is pushing for it, saying it's to teach the daughter how to care for her hair when she's older. The author argues that it's unnecessary for a toddler and that the daughter's natural hair is cute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, kids are very active and their hair is likely to get messed up quickly. The effort required for the hair routine is compared to the parent's own routine, which takes an hour. That's a lot for a young child who might not understand or appreciate it. The parent also mentions the financial aspect, which is another factor. \n\nThe partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair, but at 2, is that really feasible? The parent is concerned about the daughter feeling like she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful, which is a valid point about self-image. The partner, on the other hand, wants her to look presentable. But what does that mean for a 2-year-old? Maybe the partner is projecting their own standards onto the child.\n\nIs the parent being unreasonable by not doing the full routine? The parent is already doing some parts like washing and using leave-in products. The partner is unhappy when the routine isn't fully followed. The key here is whether the parent is in the wrong for not wanting to spend excessive time on a toddler's hair. \n\nChildren at that age don't need such elaborate routines unless there's a specific medical reason. The parent's argument about the child's activity level and the impracticality makes sense. Also, the concern about the child's self-image is important. The partner's insistence might be more about their own preferences than the child's needs. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being over the partner's desires. The partner's expectations might not be realistic for a toddler. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
