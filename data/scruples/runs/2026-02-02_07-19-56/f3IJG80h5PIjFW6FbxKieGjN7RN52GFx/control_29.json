She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author explains that their own hair routine takes an hour and is quite involved. Their partner wants them to do the same for their daughter so she learns how to care for her hair later. The author does some basics but resists the full routine, arguing it's unnecessary for a toddler who will mess it up anyway and doesn't want her to feel like she needs to spend so much time on hair to be beautiful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The partner's perspective is about teaching the daughter a routine for future hair care and wanting her to look presentable. The author's stance is practicality\u2014two years old isn't the time to enforce such a routine, plus it's a lot of effort and money. Also, the author values the daughter's natural cuteness and doesn't want to impose unrealistic standards.\n\nIs there a wrong here? The key points are the age appropriateness of the routine and the partner's constant complaints despite explanations. The author is justified in thinking that a two-year-old doesn't need an adult's hair care routine. The partner's insistence might be overreaching, especially since the child's hair is naturally curly and likely to get messy quickly. The author is also concerned about instilling a healthy self-image, which is valid.\n\nThe partner's complaint is about wanting the daughter to be presentable, but the author's argument that the daughter will ruin the hair and that the effort isn't worth it for a toddler seems reasonable. The author is making a conscious choice to avoid setting a precedent that could be harmful long-term. The partner might not be considering the age-appropriate needs and the child's natural behavior.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
