She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to spend a lot of time doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day because their own hair routine takes an hour. The partner wants the daughter to learn the routine for when she's older. The author does some basic care but skips the time-consuming parts, arguing that it's unnecessary for a toddler who will mess it up anyway. The partner is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that the daughter is too young to maintain such a routine, and they don't want her to think she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful. Also, the effort and cost are factors. On the other hand, the partner wants consistency and to teach proper hair care for the future.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the practicality of the routine, and the parent's values. At 2 years old, expecting the same hair care as an adult is unrealistic. The author is balancing practicality with the child's age and their own time. The partner's insistence might stem from wanting to instill habits early, but it's not developmentally appropriate for a toddler. The author's concern about the child's self-image is also valid\u2014why make a young girl feel she needs to maintain her looks to be beautiful? \n\nThe partner's complaints seem to be about not following their wishes, but the author is prioritizing the child's age-appropriate care and their own time. There's no indication the author is neglecting the child's hygiene; they do basic care. The partner might need to reconsider their expectations based on the child's age and the effort required. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
