She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, similar to their own elaborate routine. The partner is insisting, but the author feels it's unnecessary for a toddler.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 2-year-old is very young and active. It's normal for their hair to be messy after play. The author mentions that their routine takes an hour and is time-consuming and costly. For a toddler, expecting the same level of grooming might be unreasonable. The parent also wants to avoid making the daughter feel like she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful, which is a valid concern about self-esteem and practicality.\n\nThe partner's argument is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair in the future. But at 2, the child isn't old enough to learn such routines effectively. The author is balancing practicality and the child's needs. The partner's insistence and constant complaints might be overstepping, especially when the author is already doing some basic care. \n\nThe key points are the child's age, the impracticality of the routine for a toddler, and the parent's reasoning. The author isn't being negligent; they're making a judgment based on what's appropriate for a young child. The partner's expectations might not be realistic. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
