She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The parent (the author) is being asked by their partner to do the same elaborate hair routine on their 2-year-old daughter as they do for themselves. The author is resistant because it's time-consuming and doesn't see the point for a toddler who will mess it up. The partner insists for the daughter's future and appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair as she grows older and ensuring she looks presentable. On the other hand, the author argues that it's impractical for a 2-year-old, takes too much time, and doesn't want the daughter to feel pressured about her hair. \n\nThe key points here are the child's age and the practicality of the routine. At two years old, the daughter is too young to understand or benefit from a hair routine meant for an adult. The effort required (an hour daily) is excessive for a child who can't keep the hair neat. The author's concern about the child feeling she needs to spend time on her hair to be beautiful is valid, as it's important to avoid instilling unnecessary beauty standards at a young age.\n\nThe partner's insistence might be based on their own values or experiences, but the author's perspective is also reasonable. There's no right or wrong in parenting, but rather different priorities. The author is not in the wrong for refusing because the request seems impractical and the reasoning about the child's age and well-being is sound. The partner's complaints might stem from differing expectations, but that doesn't make the author's stance invalid.\n"
