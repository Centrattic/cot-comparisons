She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The daughter is only 2 years old, and the author's hair routine is time-consuming and expensive. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care, but the author thinks it's unnecessary at this age.\n\nHmm, first, the daughter is two. At that age, kids are naturally active and don't keep their hair neat for long. The author's routine takes an hour and is costly. The partner is pushing for this, maybe seeing it as teaching responsibility or grooming for the future. But the author argues that it's impractical and might set a bad example about needing to spend a lot of time on appearance.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the practicality of the routine, and the parent's differing views. The author is prioritizing the child's current stage and well-being against the partner's long-term goals. The author also mentions that the daughter's natural hair is cute, suggesting that the effort might not be necessary. \n\nI need to consider parenting styles. The author is concerned about the child's self-image and not feeling pressured to look a certain way. The partner wants to teach skills now for later. But at 2, is that realistic? The author is not in the wrong if they're making decisions based on the child's best interests and practical reality. The partner's insistence might be overstepping, especially if it's causing stress. So the answer is B.\n"
