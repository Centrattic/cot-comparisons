She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent should do their daughter's hair every day to teach her a routine.\n\nFirst, the daughter is only 2 years old. At that age, kids are very active and can't really take care of their own hair. The parent argues that spending an hour daily on her hair is unnecessary because she'll just ruin it. They also mention that the daughter has cute, natural ringlets and don't want her to feel pressured to spend hours on hair to feel beautiful. The partner, though, wants the daughter to learn the routine now for when she's older, and gets upset when the parent doesn't comply.\n\nSo, the parent is refusing to do the daily hair routine, and the partner is upset. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The parent's reasoning is practical: a 2-year-old can't maintain hair, it's time-consuming, and they don't want to instill unnecessary beauty standards. The partner's reasoning is about teaching a routine early, even if it's not immediately useful. \n\nFrom a child development perspective, 2-year-olds are too young to understand or follow complex routines. Forcing a daily hour-long hair routine might not be appropriate. Also, the parent is concerned about the child's self-image, which is a valid point. On the other hand, the partner might see it as preparing her for future grooming habits. \n\nBut is the parent in the wrong for not doing it? The parent is already doing some parts like washing and using products. The partner's insistence might be overstepping, especially if it's causing stress. The parent's time and effort are reasonable to consider. \n\nI think the parent is justified in their stance. The partner might need to adjust their expectations for a toddler's capabilities. So the answer would be that the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
