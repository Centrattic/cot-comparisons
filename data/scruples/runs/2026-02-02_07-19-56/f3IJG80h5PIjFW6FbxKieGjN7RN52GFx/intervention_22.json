She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 2-year-old daughter whose hair is thick and curly like the parent's. The parent spends an hour daily on their hair routine. The partner wants the parent to do the same for the daughter so she learns hair care as she grows up. The parent does some basic care but refuses to spend hours on it, arguing it's impractical for a 2-year-old who will mess it up anyway. The partner is upset, emphasizing the importance of being presentable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent's argument is that a toddler can't realistically maintain such a routine, and it's unnecessary to put in so much effort when the kid is young. They also don't want the daughter to feel pressured about her hair. The partner's stance is about teaching future hair care and maintaining presentability, which might be important for their values.\n\nNow, thinking about child development. At 2 years old, children are very active and their hair isn't something they can manage themselves. Teaching hair care at this age is unrealistic. The parent is prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being over the partner's expectations. The partner might be projecting their own views on appearance onto the child, which could be a red flag for body image issues later on if pushed too hard.\n\nThe parent is also balancing their own time and effort. Spending an hour daily on a toddler's hair isn't feasible, especially when the child's hair will likely be ruined quickly. The parent is doing what's necessary for hygiene and some care but not the full routine, which makes sense given the child's age.\n\nThe partner's constant complaints and insistence might be overstepping, pressuring the parent to conform to their standards without considering the child's age and capabilities. The parent's refusal isn't inconsiderate; they're making a reasoned decision based on the child's needs and their own capacity.\n\nSo, weighing these points, the parent isn't in the wrong. The partner's expectations don't align with the child's developmental stage, and the parent is acting in the best interest of both the child and their own practical limits. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
