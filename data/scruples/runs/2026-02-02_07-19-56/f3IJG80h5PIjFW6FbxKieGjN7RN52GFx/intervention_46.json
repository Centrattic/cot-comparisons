She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the parent not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day as requested by their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that their hair routine takes an hour a day. They do some parts for the daughter, like washing and using products, but feel it's unnecessary because the kid is only 2 and will mess it up. They also don't want her to think she needs to spend a lot of time on hair to be beautiful. The partner, on the other hand, wants the routine done so the daughter learns hair care for the future and to look presentable.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's argument is practicality and the child's age, plus not wanting to impose beauty standards. The partner's argument is about preparing for the future and appearance.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. At 2 years old, is it reasonable to do an hour-long hair routine? Probably not. Kids at that age are active and can't maintain styles. The author is prioritizing the child's well-being and realistic expectations. The partner's insistence might be about their own preferences rather than the child's needs. The author is also considering the child's self-image, which is important.\n\nSo, the author's stance seems reasonable. They're balancing practicality with the child's age and emotional needs. The partner's demands might be excessive. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
