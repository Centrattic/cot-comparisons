She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend a lot of time on their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The partner wants the author to teach the daughter the routine because it's important for her future. The author argues that the partner's demands are unreasonable given the time and effort required, and that the daughter is too young for such a strict regimen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, she's very young, and her hair isn't going to stay styled for long. The author mentions that the partner wants her to learn how to care for her hair for when she's older, but at 2, it's probably too soon to start daily routines that require an hour. The author is spending time on washing, brushing, and leave-in products, which seems reasonable for basic care. The partner is upset about not doing the full routine, which the author associates with their own hair care that takes an hour.\n\nThe key points here are the child's age, the practicality of the routine, and the partner's insistence. The author's concern about the child feeling pressured to spend time on her hair to be beautiful is valid, as it could lead to body image issues later. The partner's emphasis on \"presentability\" might be more about their own standards than the child's needs. \n\nHowever, the partner's perspective is that the author is not fulfilling a responsibility by not teaching the daughter proper hair care. But the author is already doing some of the steps, just not the intensive time-consuming ones. The author's reasoning that the hair will be ruined quickly and that the time investment isn't necessary at this age seems logical. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the partner is expecting the author to replicate their own adult routine on a toddler, that's unrealistic. The author is balancing practicality with the child's needs. The partner's complaints might stem from their own expectations rather than the child's actual needs. The author's stance is about not wanting to create unnecessary pressure on the child, which is a valid parenting choice. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They are making a reasonable decision based on the child's age and practical considerations. The partner's demands might be excessive. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
