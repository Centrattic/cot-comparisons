She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who doesn't want to do their daughter's hair every day, similar to their own elaborate routine. The partner is pushing for this, but the author feels it's unnecessary for a 2-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter is 2 years old, with curly hair. The author has a hair routine that takes an hour and costs money. The partner wants the daughter to learn the routine now for when she's older. The author does some parts but argues it's pointless for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel pressured about hair. The partner is upset when the author doesn't comply, focusing on \"presentable\" looks.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 2 is very young. At that age, kids are active and messy, so spending hours on hair might not be practical. The author's concern about the child not feeling like she needs to take so much time to be beautiful makes sense. Teaching hair care at 2 seems excessive, maybe leading to unnecessary pressure later. The partner's insistence could be about control or their own insecurities. The author's position is about practicality and the child's well-being.\n\nBut the partner might feel that starting early helps establish habits. However, the author is also considering the child's current needs and development. There's a balance between preparing for the future and respecting the present. The author isn't refusing entirely but is doing parts. The partner's constant complaints and emphasis on \"presentable\" might be overstepping, especially since the child is too young to understand or maintain such a routine.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they are prioritizing the child's current reality and emotional well-being over an unrealistic expectation for a toddler. The partner's demands seem impractical and possibly imposing their own standards on a child who isn't ready for that level of grooming.\n"
