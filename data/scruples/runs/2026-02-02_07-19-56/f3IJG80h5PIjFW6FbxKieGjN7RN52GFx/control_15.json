She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to spend an hour daily on their 2-year-old's hair. The author's reasoning is that it's impractical for a toddler, who would just mess it up anyway, and they don't want the child to feel like she needs to invest so much time to be beautiful. The partner wants the routine for when the child is older, but the author feels it's unnecessary and time-consuming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's any wrong in the author's stance. The key points are age-appropriate care and the value of time. At two years old, the child is too young to understand or benefit from a complex hair routine. The author is prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being by avoiding unnecessary stress. The partner's insistence might stem from wanting to instill habits early, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author is also considering the child's self-image, which is a valid concern. However, the constant complaints from the partner could indicate communication issues. But the core issue is whether the author is wrong for refusing. Since parenting styles vary and there's no clear right or wrong, the author's choice seems reasonable. They're making a judgment based on the child's age and their own capacity. The partner's demand might be unreasonable, expecting an adult-level routine on a toddler. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
