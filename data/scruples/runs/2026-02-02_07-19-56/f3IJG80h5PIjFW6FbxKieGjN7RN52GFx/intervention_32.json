She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they don't want to do their daughter's hair every day. The author's daughter is two years old and has curly hair like the parent. The parent's routine takes an hour a day, and they feel it's too much for a toddler. The partner wants the parent to do the same routine for the daughter so she learns later.\n\nHmm. The author argues that the daughter is too young and that the hair will just get messed up. They also don't want the daughter to feel pressured to spend time on hair. The partner disagrees, wanting the daughter to look presentable. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At two years old, the child is very young and active. It's reasonable for the parent to think that an hour-long routine isn't practical. Also, the parent's concern about the child not needing to feel that beauty requires effort is valid. The partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting the child to be groomed properly, but the parent has valid reasons for resisting. \n\nThe parent is doing some basic steps like washing and using leave-in products, which are necessary. The partner's complaints might be about the full routine, which isn't feasible for a toddler. The parent is also considering the child's well-being by not making her feel self-conscious early on. \n\nSo, the parent's refusal isn't without merit. The partner's expectation might not be realistic given the child's age and the parent's own time constraints. The parent is balancing practicality and the child's emotional needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a reasoned decision based on the child's age and development.\n"
