She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend an hour a day doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The author has thick ringlets like them, and their routine takes a lot of time and effort. The partner wants the daughter to learn proper hair care for when she's older, but the author thinks it's unnecessary since the kid is only 2 and will mess it up anyway. They also don't want her to feel pressured to spend time on hair to be beautiful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The partner's argument is about preparing the daughter for the future, ensuring she learns how to care for her hair. But the author is practical, thinking a 2-year-old can't maintain such a routine and that it's not worth the effort. Also, the daughter's natural hair is cute, so maybe the author doesn't want to impose strict routines early.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the child's age, the impracticality of the routine, and the parent's concerns about beauty standards. At 2, a child can't realistically follow an hour-long hair regimen. The author's reasoning about the child's age and the desire to avoid pressure on her self-image seems valid. The partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting to teach responsibility, but it's not age-appropriate. The author is balancing practicality with the child's well-being. Since the daughter is too young to benefit from the routine and the partner's complaints are causing conflict, the author's stance seems reasonable. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
