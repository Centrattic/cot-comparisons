She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author has thick, curly hair that takes an hour a day to manage. Their partner wants the author to do the same routine for the daughter so she learns, but the author thinks it's unnecessary.\n\nFirst, the age factor: a 2-year-old isn't going to keep her hair styled. She'll mess it up, and the effort might be wasted. The author is concerned about the time and money involved, which is valid. Also, the author wants the daughter to feel beautiful without needing to spend hours on hair, which is a positive message.\n\nThe partner's argument is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair. But at 2, is that realistic? It's more about setting an example, but the partner's insistence seems to be about the child's appearance, not the practical aspect. The author is reasonable in not wanting to enforce a routine that's impractical for a toddler's age and lifestyle.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might feel that starting early is important. But the author is already doing some parts of the routine, like washing and using products. The issue is the time commitment. The author's stance is about balancing practicality and the child's needs versus the partner's expectations. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't unreasonable. The partner's demands might be more about their own preferences rather than the child's actual needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
