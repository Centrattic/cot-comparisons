She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author explains that their own hair routine takes an hour and is quite involved. The partner wants the same routine for the daughter so she learns to take care of her hair later. The author does some steps but resists the time-consuming parts. The partner is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main points are practical: the time and effort required, the child's age making the routine impractical, and wanting her to feel beautiful without pressure. The partner's concern is about teaching proper hair care and ensuring presentability.\n\nI think the key factors here are the child's age and the necessity of the routine. At 2 years old, it's unrealistic to expect a child to maintain a complicated hair routine. The author is already doing some steps like washing and using leave-in products, which are essential. The partner's insistence might stem from wanting to establish habits early, but the author has valid concerns about the child's age and the effort required.\n\nThe author isn't being neglectful; they are making a judgment call based on practicality and the child's well-being. The partner's complaints might be about control or differing parenting styles. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing realistic and healthy approaches to their daughter's hair care. So, the answer is B.\n"
