She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault (AITA) for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The daughter is 2 years old, and the author has a complex hair routine that takes an hour. The partner wants the daughter to learn the routine now for when she's older.\n\nFirst, the author argues that it's impractical for a 2-year-old to need such a routine daily. Kids at that age are active, so meticulous styling would be ruined quickly. Plus, the author wants the daughter to feel that her natural hair is beautiful without needing hours of maintenance. The partner, on the other hand, insists on \"presentable\" looks, which might be more about their own preferences or societal expectations.\n\nThe key points are the age of the child, the practicality of the routine, and the parent's differing views on beauty standards. The author is balancing practicality with the child's well-being versus the partner's expectations. Since the daughter is very young, enforcing a strict adult hair routine might not be necessary. Also, the author's concern about not making the child feel she needs to spend a lot of time on hair to be beautiful is valid. The partner's insistence seems to be causing conflict without a strong justification for a toddler. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a reasonable choice based on the child's age and their own values.\n"
