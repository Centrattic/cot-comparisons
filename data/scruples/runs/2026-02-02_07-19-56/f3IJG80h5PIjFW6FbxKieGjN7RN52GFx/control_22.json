She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to spend as much time on their 2-year-old daughter's hair as they do on their own. The partner is pushing for the same routine to teach the daughter later.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid point. A two-year-old is very active and can easily mess up her hair. Spending hours daily on her hair might be impractical. Also, the author's concern about not making the daughter feel she needs to dedicate a lot of time to hair to feel beautiful is a good point. It's about avoiding unnecessary pressure on a young child.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's argument is about teaching future hair care. But realistically, a 2-year-old isn't going to retain that knowledge. The partner's insistence might stem from their own preferences or expectations, but the author's time and effort are significant factors here. The partner's complaints and the emphasis on \"presentability\" could be seen as excessive given the child's age.\n\nThe key factors here are the child's age, practicality, and the author's valid reasons for not doing the full routine. The partner's insistence without considering the practical challenges might be overstepping. The author isn't neglecting the daughter's basic needs; they're managing the situation realistically. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
