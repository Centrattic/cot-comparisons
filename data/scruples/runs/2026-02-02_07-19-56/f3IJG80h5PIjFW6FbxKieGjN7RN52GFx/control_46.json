She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent (the author) who doesn't want to spend time doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, similar to their own routine. The partner wants the author to do this so the daughter learns how to care for her hair as she gets older. The author argues that it's impractical because the kid is 2 and will mess it up, and they also don't want her to feel like she needs to spend hours on hair to be beautiful. The partner is upset when the author doesn't comply, emphasizing the importance of looking presentable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is practical: the child is very young, the effort required is high, and they don't want to instill the idea that beauty requires excessive maintenance. The partner's stance is about teaching responsibility and ensuring the daughter looks presentable, which the partner values.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the age of the child (2 years old), the practicality of the routine, and the differing values between the parents. At two, kids are very active and their hair is hard to manage. The author is already doing some basic care, like washing and leave-in products. The partner wants more, but the author feels it's unnecessary and even harmful in terms of beauty standards.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to do all care; they're just not doing an hour-long routine. The partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting to teach grooming habits early, but maybe not considering the child's age-appropriate behavior. The author is prioritizing the child's well-being and practicality, which seems reasonable. It's also about shared parenting values\u2014maybe the partner is imposing their own preferences without considering the other parent's viewpoint.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a disagreement between parents about how to raise their child. The author isn't neglecting the child; they're making a judgment based on the child's age and their own beliefs about beauty standards. The partner's constant complaints might be overstepping, especially if they're not respecting the other parent's reasoning. The author's stance is about what's realistic and healthy for the child, so they might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
