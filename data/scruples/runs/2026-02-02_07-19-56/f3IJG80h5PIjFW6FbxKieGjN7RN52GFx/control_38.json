She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is at fault for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The situation involves the partner wanting the daughter to learn proper hair care for when she's older, while the author thinks it's unnecessary given the child's age and the effort required.\n\nFirst, the daughter is only two. At that age, children are active and their hair is unlikely to stay styled for long. The author mentions that their own routine takes an hour and is costly. It's reasonable to question the practicality of applying such a routine to a toddler who can't maintain it and isn't old enough to benefit from learning the skills yet.\n\nThe partner's insistence seems to stem from a desire to instill habits early. However, the author's concern about the child feeling the need to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful is valid. It's important not to impose adult beauty standards on a young child. Also, the effort and cost involved are real factors; the parent shouldn't have to bear an unreasonable burden for something that's not essential at this age.\n\nThe key points here are the child's age, the impracticality of maintaining a toddler's hair with an adult's routine, and the parent's right to set boundaries. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being over the partner's expectations. The partner's complaints might stem from not considering the feasibility and appropriateness for the child's age. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
