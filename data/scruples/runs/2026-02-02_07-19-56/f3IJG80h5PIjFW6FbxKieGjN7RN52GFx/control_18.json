She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent (the author) who doesn't want to spend an hour daily doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair, similar to their own routine. The partner is pushing for it, arguing it's important for the daughter to learn hair care for the future. The author feels it's unnecessary for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel pressured about her appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning: the daughter is only 2, so spending so much time on her hair isn't practical. Also, the author thinks the daughter's natural curls are cute and doesn't want her to associate beauty with effort. The partner's argument is about teaching hair care skills early and ensuring she looks presentable. \n\nI should think about whether the parent's refusal is reasonable. At age 2, a child is too young to understand or benefit from a complex hair routine. The effort required seems excessive for her age. The author is also concerned about instilling a healthy self-image, which is valid. The partner's insistence might be imposing adult standards on a toddler. \n\nIs there a duty to comply with the partner's request? The partner is making demands that may not align with the child's needs. The author is balancing practicality and the child's well-being. The partner's complaints might indicate a deeper issue about expectations versus reality. The key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since the daughter is 2, the author's refusal seems justified. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
