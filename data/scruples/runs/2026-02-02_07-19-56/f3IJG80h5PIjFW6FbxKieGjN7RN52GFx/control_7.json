She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) not wanting to spend an hour every day doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair, while the partner insists on it. The author argues that it's unnecessary for a toddler and doesn't want the child to feel like she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful. The partner wants her to \"look presentable\" and is upset when the author doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is practical: a 2-year-old won't keep the hair styled, so the effort is wasted. Also, they don't want the child to associate beauty with extensive hair care. They're prioritizing the child's well-being and practicality. On the other hand, the partner might see it as teaching the daughter a skill for the future, but that seems a bit far-fetched for a toddler.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child and the partner's insistence. At 2 years old, it's natural for a child to be active and messy. Expecting a daily hour-long hair routine seems excessive. The author is also considering the child's self-image, which is a valid concern. The partner's complaints and constant insistence might be overbearing, especially since the author is already doing some basic care. \n\nIs there a cultural or personal expectation here? Maybe the partner has their own reasons, but it's important to respect the author's boundaries. The author isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014they're doing parts of the routine. The conflict seems more about differing priorities and expectations. The author's stance is reasonable because the partner's demand might not be realistic for the child's age or the daily routine.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a judgment based on practicality and the child's best interests. The partner's insistence might stem from their own preferences, but the author has valid reasons for not complying. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
