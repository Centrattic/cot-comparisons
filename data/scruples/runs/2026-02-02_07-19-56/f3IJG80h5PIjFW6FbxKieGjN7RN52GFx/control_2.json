She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The daughter is 2 years old and has ringlets like the parent. The parent's routine takes an hour daily, and the partner wants the same done for the daughter. The parent does some steps but refuses to spend hours on it, thinking it's unnecessary for a toddler. The partner insists on it for \"presentable\" looks and future hair care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They have a valid point that a 2-year-old is too young to maintain such a routine. The time and effort required might not be practical or beneficial at her age. Also, the parent wants to avoid pressuring the daughter about hair, emphasizing natural beauty. That's a healthy mindset for a child's self-esteem.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's concern might stem from wanting to start early with hair care education. But realistically, does a 2-year-old need an hour-long hair routine? It seems excessive. The parent's argument about the daughter ruining her hair after the effort also makes sense. Toddlers are active, so maintaining such a routine seems impractical.\n\nThe key points here are the age appropriateness of the routine, the practicality, and the parent's concern about teaching their daughter that she needs to spend so much time on hair to be beautiful. These seem valid. The partner's insistence might be stemming from their own values but doesn't consider the child's age or the parent's capacity.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent is setting reasonable boundaries based on the child's age and their own capacity. The partner's complaints might be about differing priorities, but the parent isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's well-being and practicality. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
