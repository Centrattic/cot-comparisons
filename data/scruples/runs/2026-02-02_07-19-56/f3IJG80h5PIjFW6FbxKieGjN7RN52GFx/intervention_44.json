She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The situation involves a 2-year-old with curly hair, and the author spends an hour daily on their own hair. The partner wants the same routine for the daughter to teach her care when older. The author does some basic steps but resists the full routine, arguing it's impractical and doesn't want the child to feel pressured. The partner is upset about this.\n\nFirst, consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, her hair isn't going to stay styled for long, so spending an hour daily might be excessive. The author's point about teaching the daughter unnecessary pressure about appearance is valid. Parents often want to instill good habits, but maybe at this age, it's more about basic hygiene than elaborate styles.\n\nThe partner's insistence could stem from wanting to prepare her, but is that reasonable? The author is balancing their own time and effort. The partner's complaints might be about appearance expectations, but the author prioritizes the child's well-being in terms of not feeling the need for excessive grooming. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect is mentioned. Hair products and time are costly. At 2, the child's activities likely don't require such a routine. The author's argument that the effort doesn't make sense because the child will ruin it seems practical. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe some compromise where the partner's concerns are addressed without the full routine. However, the core issue is about differing parenting philosophies. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're making a judgment call for their child's benefit. The partner might feel their input isn't respected, but the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The decision is based on practicality, the child's age, and the author's concern about setting healthy beauty standards.\n"
