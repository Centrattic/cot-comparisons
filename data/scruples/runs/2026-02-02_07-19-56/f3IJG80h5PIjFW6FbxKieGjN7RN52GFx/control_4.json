She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, similar to their own daily routine, while the partner insists on it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Two years old is very young. At that age, a child is active and probably doesn't stay still long enough for an hour-long hair routine. The parent argues that it's impractical and that the child's natural hair is cute as is. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care for when she's older, but maybe they're not considering the child's age and development.\n\nThe parent is concerned about the time and effort required. They do some basic steps like washing and using leave-in products but don't do the full routine. The partner is upset about this. The parent also mentions not wanting the daughter to feel pressured to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful, which seems like a valid point about self-esteem and body image.\n\nI should think about parenting styles and what's appropriate for a toddler. Teaching hair care might be more realistic when the child is older, not at two. The parent is balancing practicality with the partner's desires. The partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting to instill habits early, but they might not be considering the child's current capabilities and the parent's time.\n\nSo, the parent is not necessarily in the wrong. They're making a judgment call based on the child's age and their own capacity. The partner's complaints might be excessive given the circumstances. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
