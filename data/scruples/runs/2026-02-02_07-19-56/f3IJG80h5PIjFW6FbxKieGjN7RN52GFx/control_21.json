She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author has thick hair that requires an hour-long routine daily. Their partner wants them to apply the same regimen to their daughter to teach her good habits later. The author does some basic steps but resists spending hours on it because the toddler is too young and the effort seems unnecessary. They also don't want the child to feel pressured about her appearance. The partner insists on it for \"presentability.\"\n\nFirst, consider the age of the child. A 2-year-old is still very young and likely won't retain the habits taught now. The author's concern about not wanting the child to feel that she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful is valid. It's about instilling self-worth without vanity-based pressures.\n\nThe partner's argument is about future habits, but the author is prioritizing the child's immediate needs and practicality. The time and effort required might be excessive for a toddler. Also, the author is already doing some steps like washing and using leave-in products, which is reasonable for her age.\n\nThe partner's insistence could be overstepping, especially if they're complaining constantly. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially when the request isn't age-appropriate. The key points are the child's age, the impracticality of the routine, and the potential negative message about self-image. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
