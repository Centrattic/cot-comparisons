She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend an hour each day doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The partner is pushing for it because they want the daughter to learn hair care for when she's older. The author argues that it's impractical for a toddler, who will just mess it up, and they don't want the kid to feel like she needs to spend so much time on hair to be beautiful.\n\nFirst, the partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair. But the daughter is only 2. At that age, can she really learn or benefit from the routine? Maybe the partner is projecting their own preferences onto their child. The author's point about the effort and time is valid. An hour a day for someone who's too young to understand or maintain it seems excessive.\n\nThe author is also concerned about the message it sends. Teaching a child that she needs to spend so much time on her appearance to feel beautiful could have negative implications. That's a valid concern. The partner wants the daughter to be \"presentable,\" but the author thinks there's a different standard for toddlers. \n\nThe partner's constant complaints and insistence might be overstepping. It's a partnership, so both should have mutual respect for each other's perspectives. The author's time and energy are their own, and they're not obligated to meet the partner's expectations if they don't agree. \n\nBut then again, the partner is trying to plan for the future. However, enforcing a complex routine on a toddler might not be practical or beneficial. The author is balancing their own well-being and their child's best interests. It seems like the partner isn't considering the child's age or the author's perspective.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a reasonable choice based on the child's age and their own limits. The partner's demands might be unrealistic here. So the answer should be B.\n"
