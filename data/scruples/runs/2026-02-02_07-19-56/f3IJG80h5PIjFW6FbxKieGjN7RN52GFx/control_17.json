She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent (the author) who is a parent to a 2-year-old daughter with curly hair. The author's partner wants the author to maintain the same hair care routine for the daughter as they do for themselves, taking over an hour daily. The author feels that it's unnecessary for such a young child and doesn't want her to feel like she has to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful. The partner is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's argument is practical: the child is 2, so putting hours into her hair is impractical because she'll just ruin it. Also, the author is concerned about instilling an unrealistic beauty standard. The partner's perspective is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair for the future and ensuring she looks presentable. \n\nBut wait, the daughter is only two. At that age, kids can't really take care of their own hair, so the partner's reasoning might be a bit ahead of time. Also, the author mentions that the routine is time-consuming and costly. The partner's complaints might be overstepping here by not considering the practicality and the child's age. \n\nThe author is also prioritizing the child's current happiness and not making her feel like she needs to maintain a certain look. That seems reasonable. On the other hand, the partner might be trying to prepare the child for the future, but maybe they're not considering the child's age and the actual benefits of such a routine at this stage.\n\nAnother angle: the author is already doing some parts of the routine (washing, brushing, leave-in products), which the partner might be expecting the full hour routine. The partner's insistence might be about control or their own preferences rather than the child's best interest. The author's stance is practical and child-centered, while the partner's demands might be more about personal preferences without considering the child's needs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
