She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend an hour a day on their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The author's partner wants them to do the same routine they do for themselves, but the author thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 2-year-old is very young and active. Their hair is likely to get messed up quickly, no matter how much you style it. The effort required for an hour-long routine might not be practical here. \n\nThen, the author's reasoning: they don't want the daughter to feel like she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful. That seems like a good point about self-esteem and body image from a young age. Teaching that being natural is okay is important.\n\nThe partner's perspective is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair in the future. But a 2-year-old isn't old enough to learn hair care routines effectively. The partner's insistence might stem from wanting to instill habits early, but maybe they're not considering the child's age and needs.\n\nThe author is also considering the time and money involved. The routine is time-consuming and costly. The partner's complaints about the author not doing it might be adding stress to their relationship. \n\nIs the author wrong for not complying? Well, the partner's request is about the author's own routine being modeled for the daughter, but the author is prioritizing the child's well-being and practicality. The author isn't neglecting the child; they're doing some basics like washing and brushing. The partner's insistence might be unrealistic given the child's age. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on the child's age, practicality, and their values. The partner might need to adjust their expectations. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
