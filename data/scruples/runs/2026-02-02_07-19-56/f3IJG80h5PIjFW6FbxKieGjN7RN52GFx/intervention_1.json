She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down. The author has a 2-year-old daughter with curly hair, similar to their own. The author's hair routine takes an hour every day, which is a lot of time and effort. The partner wants the author to do the same routine for the daughter so she learns how to care for her hair later. The author does some parts like washing, brushing, and leave-in products but doesn't spend hours on it because the kid is just going to mess it up. Plus, the author thinks the daughter is cute as is and doesn't want her to feel like she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful. The partner is upset and wants the daughter to look \"presentable.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Two years old is very young. At that age, kids are active and can't really take care of their hair themselves. The author's point about the time and effort is valid. Spending an hour on a 2-year-old's hair seems impractical because the child will likely undo it quickly. Also, the author's concern about instilling unrealistic beauty standards is important. Wanting a child to look presentable is one thing, but pushing a complex routine from such a young age might lead to unnecessary pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's argument is that the daughter should learn from an early age. But realistically, how much can a toddler learn about hair care? Maybe the partner is projecting their own expectations or their own standards onto the child. The author is also considering the child's well-being, not just physical but emotional\u2014avoiding the idea that beauty requires too much effort.\n\nThe key points here are practicality and the child's best interest. The author is balancing their own time, the child's age, and the message they want to send versus the partner's insistence on appearance. The partner might be overestimating what's necessary for a toddler. Also, the author is already doing some basic care, which is sufficient for a child that age. The partner's constant complaints seem excessive given the circumstances.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. The partner's expectations are unrealistic for a 2-year-old. The author is making a reasonable choice based on the child's age and the practical aspects. The partner might need to adjust their expectations or find a middle ground without pressuring the author to spend unnecessary time on something that isn't developmentally appropriate.\n"
