She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author explains that their hair routine takes an hour and is complicated. The partner wants the same routine for the daughter to teach her as she grows up. The author does some basic care but refuses the full routine, thinking it's impractical for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel pressured about her appearance. The partner is upset about not doing it.\n\nHmm. First, the daughter is only 2. At that age, toddlers are very active and can't stay still, so spending hours on hair might not be practical. The author's point about the time and effort makes sense. Also, the idea of not wanting the daughter to feel like she needs to spend so much time on her hair is a valid concern about self-image. Parents often have different views on how to raise kids, especially when it comes to beauty standards. The partner might be trying to instill habits early, but maybe they're not considering the child's age and practicality. The author is also trying to keep things simple and let the child be cute as is. It seems like a difference in parenting styles. There's no clear right or wrong, but the author has reasonable arguments. The partner's insistence might be oversteering, especially since the child is too young to understand the routine. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
