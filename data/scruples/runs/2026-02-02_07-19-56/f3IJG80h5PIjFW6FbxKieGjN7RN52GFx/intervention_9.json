She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent, who is presumably the mother, not wanting to spend an hour daily on their 2-year-old daughter's hair, similar to her own routine. The partner insists on it for the daughter's future hair care, but the parent thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler who will mess it up and wants her to feel beautiful without that pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parent's argument is that the child is too young, her hair is cute as is, and it's impractical to spend so much time on it. The partner's concern is about teaching the daughter proper hair care for when she's older, emphasizing being presentable. The parent feels the partner is being unreasonable, given the effort and cost involved. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I should consider typical parenting practices. At 2 years old, children are not expected to maintain complex hair routines. Parents usually focus on basic hygiene and manageability. The idea of teaching a 2-year-old to take care of her hair seems premature. The parent's stance is about practicality and the child's well-being, wanting to avoid unnecessary pressure. The partner's insistence might be based on their own values or expectations, but it's not common to impose adult grooming standards on such a young child.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, toddlers are in a stage where they explore and move around, so intricate hairstyles wouldn't last. The parent's approach is more realistic. Also, the parent's concern about the child feeling she needs to spend time on hair to be beautiful is valid, as instilling self-esteem without external pressures is a good parenting goal.\n\nThe partner's complaints and constant insistence might be overstepping, especially since the parent is already doing some aspects of the routine. The parent is explaining the time and cost issues, which are valid considerations. The partner's focus on \"presentability\" might be more about their own preferences rather than the child's needs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're making a reasonable decision based on the child's age and practicality. The partner's expectations seem unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
