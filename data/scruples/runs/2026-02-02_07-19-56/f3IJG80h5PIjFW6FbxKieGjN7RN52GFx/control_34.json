She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, similar to their own lengthy routine. The partner is pushing for it to teach the daughter later, but the parent thinks it's unnecessary at her age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Two years old is very young, so expecting a complicated hair routine might be impractical. Kids at that age are active and won't keep their hair neat for long. The parent's argument about time and effort makes sense because maintaining such a routine would take a lot of work, especially for a toddler who's not going to sit still.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions wanting the daughter to feel beautiful without feeling the need for excessive hair care. That's a valid point about body image and self-worth. Teaching a 2-year-old to care for her hair might be more about the parent's own routines than what the child needs now.\n\nThe partner's insistence on \"presentability\" could stem from their own values, but maybe they're not considering the child's age-appropriate needs. The parent is already doing some steps like washing and using products, which is sufficient for a toddler. The partner's constant complaints might be overstepping, especially since the parent is explaining the challenges.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for refusing to do an elaborate daily routine for a two-year-old. It's reasonable to prioritize practicality and the child's current stage of life. Answer B.\n"
