She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The daughter is 2 years old, so she's really young. The author has a complex hair routine that takes an hour a day, and the partner wants them to do the same for the daughter. The author does some basics but refuses the lengthy part, arguing it's unnecessary for a toddler who would ruin it anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2, toddlers are very active and can't really take care of their hair themselves. Making them go through an hour-long routine might not be practical. The author's concern about the time and effort is valid. Also, the parent doesn't want the daughter to feel pressured about her appearance, which is a good point about self-esteem.\n\nThe partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair in the future. But is it necessary at such a young age? Maybe there's a middle ground. The author is already doing the basics like washing, brushing, and using leave-in products. The partner is upset about not doing the full routine, but maybe they're overestimating the importance of this at age 2.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The key factors are the child's age, practicality, the parent's values about beauty standards, and the partner's insistence. The author isn't neglecting the daughter's hygiene; they're doing the essential parts. The partner might be imposing their own preferences without considering the child's needs and the impracticality. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to the child's age and avoiding unrealistic expectations.\n"
