She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) who doesn't want to spend an hour each day doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair, as their partner insists. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care for when she's older, but the author thinks it's unnecessary given the child's age and the effort involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is only 2 years old. At that age, children are still developing motor skills and tend to be active, so keeping their hair perfectly styled might not be practical. The author mentions that the routine takes an hour and is time-consuming and costly. The partner is pushing for this routine to teach future hair care, but the author disagrees, thinking it's not reasonable to impose such expectations on a toddler.\n\nThe author's reasoning seems valid. A two-year-old isn't going to maintain a complex hairstyle all day. Plus, the author is concerned about the child feeling that she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful, which touches on self-esteem and body image issues early on. The partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting to instill good habits, but maybe not considering the child's age and developmental stage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the partner's demands are reasonable. Since the child is very young, the effort required for such a routine isn't justified. The author is balancing practicality and the child's well-being against the partner's expectations. The partner might be overextending the idea of preparing for the future, not considering the present context. The author is making a choice that prioritizes the child's current needs and their own time and resources. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
