She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has thick, curly hair that takes an hour a day to manage. Their partner wants them to do the same routine for their daughter so she learns as she grows up. The author does some basics but isn't spending hours on it, thinking it's unnecessary at this age. The partner is upset and insists on the routine for \"presentable\" looks.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are the child's age, the effort required, and differing priorities between the parents. At 2 years old, the daughter is likely to mess up her hair anyway. Teaching hair care at this age might be premature. The author is concerned about the time and money involved, and also about the child not feeling pressured to look a certain way. That's a valid point about self-esteem.\n\nThe partner's argument is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair for the future. But realistically, a 2-year-old isn't going to retain that knowledge. Maybe the partner has their own expectations or maybe they value appearance more. The author's stance is practical and child-centric, considering the child's age and the futility of the effort. \n\nThe partner is being insistent and complaining constantly, which might indicate they're not respecting the author's time and the child's developmental stage. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing what's reasonable. There's no harm in not doing the full routine. The partner's insistence could be seen as unrealistic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should share tasks, but the author is doing some steps. The core issue is the partner's push for an elaborate routine that's not age-appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to go overboard. So the answer is B.\n"
