She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The situation involves a partner who wants the author to do the same hair routine they do, which takes an hour a day. The author argues that it's unnecessary for a 2-year-old and that the cute, natural look is better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, kids are very active and their hair doesn't stay styled for long. The effort required for the routine might not be practical. The author also mentions wanting the daughter to feel beautiful without pressure, which is a valid point about self-esteem.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's perspective is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair for the future. But does a 2-year-old really need to learn that? It might be more about the partner's own preferences. The author is concerned about the time and money involved, which is understandable. \n\nThe partner's constant complaints suggest a possible imbalance in expectations. The author is explaining their reasoning, but the partner isn't respecting that. The key here is whether the author has a valid reason to decline. Since the daughter is young, the author's stance seems reasonable. The partner's insistence might be more about their own standards rather than the child's needs. \n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a judgment call based on practicality and the child's well-being. The partner's demands might be unrealistic given the child's age. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
