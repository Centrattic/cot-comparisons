She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author explains that their own hair routine is time-consuming and expensive, and they feel it's unnecessary for a toddler. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care for the future, but the author thinks it's impractical and doesn't want the child to feel pressured about her appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is only 2 years old. At that age, children are very active and their hair is unlikely to stay styled. The effort required for the routine seems excessive for a toddler. The author is concerned about the child's self-image if she feels she needs to spend a lot of time on hair. That's a valid point about not instilling unnecessary beauty standards early on.\n\nThe partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair when she's older. But does a 2-year-old really need to learn that now? Maybe the partner is projecting their own preferences onto the situation. Also, the author is doing some basics like washing and using leave-in products, which are probably sufficient for a child's hygiene and health.\n\nAnother angle: the author is spending significant time and money on their own hair, which they might not want to transfer to their child. There's also the aspect of differing parenting styles. The partner wants strict adherence to a routine, while the author is more relaxed. This could be a communication issue rather than one party being wrong.\n\nBut wait, is there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, hair care from a young age might be more emphasized. However, the author mentions their own experience with ringlets and the effort involved. The partner's insistence on \"presentable\" might be about their own standards, not the child's needs.\n\nThe child's well-being is crucial. Making a toddler feel she needs to look a certain way could have negative effects. The author's stance seems protective in that sense. However, the partner might be trying to prepare for the future, but realistically, at 2, the hair isn't going to stay styled. The effort might be more for the partner's satisfaction than the child's benefit.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is doing what they believe is best for the child and their own capacity. The partner's demands might be unreasonable given the child's age. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are making a judgment call based on practicality and the child's best interests.\n"
