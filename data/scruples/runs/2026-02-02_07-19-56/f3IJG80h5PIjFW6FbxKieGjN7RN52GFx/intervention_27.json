She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not wanting to spend as much time on their 2-year-old daughter's hair as their partner wants.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is that their daughter is only 2, has curly hair like them, and their own hair routine takes an hour. They do some basic care but don't want to spend hours on it since the kid will mess it up, and they want her to feel beautiful without the pressure. The partner, though, thinks the author should do the full routine to teach the daughter how to care for her hair later, and is upset when they don't. The author feels it's unnecessary for a toddler and doesn't want the child to feel she needs to spend time on hair to be beautiful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: age appropriateness, the parent's time and effort, the partner's insistence on \"presentability,\" and the underlying values about beauty standards for a young child.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the partner wants the daughter to be presentable, which might be a matter of personal values or social norms. On the other hand, the author is prioritizing the child's well-being and not imposing unnecessary expectations at such a young age. The partner might feel that the author isn't meeting their expectations as a parent, but the author is making a conscious choice based on their beliefs.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, parenting often involves differing opinions. The author isn't neglecting the child; they're doing some basic care. The partner is upset about the lack of effort, but the author's reasoning seems valid. At 2, a child can't maintain a complex hairstyle, so spending hours daily might be impractical and not in the child's best interest. Plus, the author's concern about the child feeling she needs to work for beauty is a valid point about self-esteem.\n\nBut maybe the partner's perspective is about setting a routine early. However, the author is balancing their own time and the child's needs. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a reasonable choice based on the child's age and their own values. The partner's insistence might be overreaching, expecting something impractical for a toddler. So the answer is B.\n"
