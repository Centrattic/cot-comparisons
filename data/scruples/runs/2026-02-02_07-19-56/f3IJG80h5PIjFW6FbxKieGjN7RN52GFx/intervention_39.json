She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The partner is pushing for the same routine as the author's, which takes an hour. The author argues that it's unnecessary for a toddler and that the child's natural hair is cute. The partner wants her to look presentable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 2-year-old is very young, and their hair is probably not going to stay styled for long. The author's argument that it's impractical makes sense. Plus, the parent mentions that the daughter's natural hair is cute, so maybe there's a point about not putting pressure on a child to look a certain way.\n\nThe partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair in the future. But at two years old, is it really about teaching skills now, or more about the partner's own preferences? The author is spending a lot of time and money on their own hair, which is understandable, but the partner is expecting the same for a toddler. That might be a bit excessive. \n\nAlso, the partner is complaining constantly, which could indicate a communication issue. The author is trying to explain the effort involved, but the partner isn't listening. The author might be right to set boundaries here. It's important for parents to have different approaches, but maybe the partner is overstepping by being insistent when the child's age makes the routine impractical. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the partner has valid concerns about presentability, but the author's reasoning seems reasonable. The main question is whether the author is wrong for not complying. Considering the child's age and the impracticality, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the partner's perspective is about teaching, but maybe that's not necessary now. The author is protecting their child from unnecessary pressure and saving time. So, B seems correct here.\n"
