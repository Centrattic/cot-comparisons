She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to spend hours on their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The partner wants the same routine as the author's, which takes an hour each day, arguing it's for the daughter's future. The author does some basic care but resists the full routine.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is practical: the kid is two, so it's impractical and the effort might be wasted. They also mention the daughter's cute natural look and not wanting her to feel pressured about hair. The partner is pushing for \"presentable\" looks, but the author thinks it's unnecessary.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, does the partner have a valid point? Maybe in teaching routines, but a 2-year-old might not need that. The author is balancing practicality against the partner's expectations. The question is if the author is in the wrong for not complying.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to do any hair care; they do washing, brushing, leave-ins. The issue is the time and effort. The partner's insistence might be overstepping, especially if it's causing stress. The author's concern about the child's self-image is valid too. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. But some might argue they should accommodate the partner's wishes for the child's benefit.\n\nBut considering the child's age and practicality, the author's stance makes sense. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
