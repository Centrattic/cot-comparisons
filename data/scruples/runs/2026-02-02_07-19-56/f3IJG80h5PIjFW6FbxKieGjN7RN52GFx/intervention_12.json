She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The situation is that the author's partner wants them to follow the same hair routine as they do, which takes an hour, but the author thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is 2 years old, so she's very young. The author's hair routine is time-consuming and expensive. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care for when she's older, but the author feels it's not practical now and doesn't want the daughter to feel pressured about her appearance.\n\nThe author is following some steps like washing, brushing, and using leave-in products, which are basic care. The partner is insistent and complains when the author doesn't do the full routine. The author is worried about the time and money involved.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether it's reasonable to expect a 2-year-old to have the same hair care routine as an adult. At that age, children are not capable of maintaining complex routines, and their hair isn't expected to look presentable in the same way. The author is prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being, avoiding unnecessary stress and effort. The partner's insistence might be based on a desire for the child to learn early, but the author's approach seems age-appropriate.\n\nThe author is also concerned about the child's self-esteem, not wanting her to feel she needs to spend hours on her hair to be beautiful. That's a valid point. The partner might be projecting their own values, but the author isn't obligated to comply if it's not in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
