She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The daughter has thick ringlets, and the parent's routine takes an hour. The partner wants the same routine for the daughter to teach her when she's older. The parent does some basics but doesn't spend hours on it because the kid is too young and the effort doesn't make sense. The partner is upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The parent is managing their own time and priorities. The partner wants to instill a hair care routine early, but the parent thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler. The parent's argument is that the child is too young to maintain such a routine, and they don't want her to feel pressured to spend time on her hair for beauty. The partner emphasizes \"presentable,\" which might be more about appearance than health or practicality.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, the partner's reasoning is about long-term habits, but the daughter is 2. The parent is making a judgment call based on the child's age and the practicality. The parent is also considering the child's self-worth not being tied to hair care. The partner's complaints seem more about their own preferences. \n\nThe parent is not neglecting basic care; they're doing washing, brushing, leave-in products. So, they're maintaining some level of care. The partner's insistence on a full routine might be overstepping, especially since the child is too young to handle it. The parent is also considering the effort and cost involved. \n\nSo, the parent is making a reasonable decision based on the child's age and practicality. The partner's demands might be unrealistic. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
