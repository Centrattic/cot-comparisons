She has thick ringlets like I do.

I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, similar to their own routine. The partner is pushing for it, thinking it's important for the daughter to learn later. The author argues that it's too time-consuming and unnecessary since the toddler can just ruin it. Also, they think her natural hair is cute and don't want her to feel like she needs to spend time on hair to be beautiful.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, she's very young. Parents often have different routines and priorities when it comes to caring for small kids. The author's routine takes an hour a day, which is a lot for a 2-year-old. But the partner wants them to do the same for the daughter. \n\nThe partner's reasoning is about preparing the daughter for her own hair care as she grows up. However, the author is concerned that the effort is wasted since the kid is too young and that it might send the wrong message about beauty. \n\nFrom a time and practicality standpoint, spending an hour on a 2-year-old's hair might not be realistic. Kids that age are active, and their hair can get messed up quickly. Plus, the author's own routine is a personal choice, and the daughter's needs might not align with that. \n\nAlso, the aspect of self-worth and beauty expectations is important. The author doesn't want the daughter to feel that she has to spend a lot of time on her hair to be considered beautiful. That's a valid point about body image and self-esteem. \n\nBut then, the partner is insistent and complains constantly. Maybe the partner feels it's important for the daughter's grooming or for the author to model the behavior. However, the author is explaining the effort and cost involved, which the partner isn't respecting. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, is the author wrong for not wanting to do that daily? Well, the child is 2, so it's understandable that the parent would find it excessive. The partner's insistence might be overreaching, especially since the daughter's age makes the routine impractical. The author's reasoning seems logical. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But the user initially thought A (in the wrong). I need to make sure I'm not missing something. \n\nOther factors: The author does some parts like washing, brushing, and leave-in products. So they are not neglecting it entirely. The partner's main issue is the full routine, which is time-consuming. The core of the conflict is about priorities and differing views on what's appropriate for a toddler. \n\nIn most cases, parents have to balance their own routines with the child's needs. Since the daughter is so young, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize practicality over a complex routine. The partner's argument about future preparation might not be relevant yet. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
