She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author explains that their own hair routine takes an hour and is very labor-intensive. The partner wants the daughter to learn the routine for when she's older, but the author thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel pressured about her hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, the daughter is very young. The parent's argument is that the time and effort required aren't worth it for a child who will just mess it up. Also, the parent values the daughter's natural hair as cute and doesn't want her to associate beauty with extensive hair care. \n\nThe partner's side is that it's important for the daughter to learn how to care for her hair, implying that the parent should teach by example. But does a 2-year-old really need to learn such a complex routine? It's possible that the partner is projecting their own values onto the situation, maybe influenced by their own experiences with hair care. \n\nThe key points here are the child's age, the practicality of the routine, and the parents' differing priorities. The author is making a reasonable argument that the effort isn't justified for a toddler. Also, the concern about the daughter feeling pressured about her appearance is valid, promoting self-acceptance from an early age. \n\nThe partner's insistence might stem from a desire to instill certain values, but it's important to recognize that children at this age don't need to learn such routines. The author's stance is about balancing practicality with their own well-being and the child's best interests. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a decision based on the child's age and the lack of necessity for such a routine. The answer should be B.\n"
