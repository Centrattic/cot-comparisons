She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent not wanting to spend an hour on their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, similar to their own routine, while the partner insists on doing so. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. She's only 2 years old. At that age, kids are very active and their hair is likely to get messed up quickly regardless of how neatly it's done. The parent argues that it's not practical to spend so much time on her hair when she's just going to ruin it. Also, the parent is concerned about the child feeling pressure to spend a lot of time on her hair, which is a valid point about self-esteem and beauty standards.\n\nThe partner's argument is about making the daughter look presentable and teaching her how to care for her hair when she's older. But realistically, a 2-year-old isn't going to benefit much from adult hair routines. Teaching hair care at that age might not be effective, and enforcing such a routine could be more about the parent's preferences than the child's needs.\n\nThe parent is already doing some steps like washing with the right products, brushing, and using leave-in products. That seems sufficient for a toddler's hair care. The partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting to instill habits early, but it's important to balance that with the child's developmental stage and practicality.\n\nFinancial and time costs are also mentioned. The routine takes an hour and requires products, which can be a burden. The parent is trying to manage these resources wisely, especially considering the child's age and activity level.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whether the parent is overstepping by refusing. The key points are the child's age, the impracticality of the routine, and the parent's valid concerns about self-image. The partner's demands might be reasonable in intent but not in execution given the circumstances. So the parent isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here.\n"
