She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author has a complex hair routine that takes an hour and is expensive. The partner wants the daughter to learn the same routine now so she knows how to care for her hair later. The author does some basic steps but refuses the full routine, thinking it's unnecessary for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel pressured about her appearance. The partner is upset about this.\n\nFirst, consider the child's age. At 2 years old, a child is very active and probably can't sit still for a long hair routine. It's practical to question whether such a detailed routine is feasible or necessary at this age. The author is also concerned about the child feeling that she needs to spend hours on her hair to be beautiful. That's a valid point about body image and self-worth from an early age.\n\nThe partner's argument is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair as she grows up. But does a 2-year-old really need to learn complex hair care? It might be more about the partner's own values or expectations. The author's time and resources are significant factors here\u2014using an hour each day and spending money on products for a child who can't even understand or appreciate it yet.\n\nAnother angle is the partner's insistence and constant complaints. If the partner is pressuring the author to do something that's impractical and stressful, maybe that's where the conflict lies. The author is prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being, while the partner is focused on future grooming habits. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when it's about a very young child. There's a balance between teaching responsibility and overburdening a toddler. So, the answer is likely B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
