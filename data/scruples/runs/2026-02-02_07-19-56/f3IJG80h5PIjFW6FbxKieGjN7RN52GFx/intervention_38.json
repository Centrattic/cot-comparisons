She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who doesn't want to spend an hour a day on their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The partner is pushing for it, saying it's to teach her how to care for her hair in the future. The author argues that it's not practical for a toddler, that the daughter would just mess it up, and that they don't want her to feel she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The partner's reasoning is about preparing the child for the future, maybe instilling a sense of personal grooming. But the author feels it's unnecessary for a 2-year-old and that it's a waste of time since the child can't maintain it. Also, the author is concerned about the child's self-image if she feels pressured to have her hair done a certain way.\n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, the partner is being insistent and complaining constantly, which might be a problem. But the author is a parent too, and they have the right to set boundaries. The daughter is very young, so maybe the partner's expectations are unrealistic. The author is doing some basic hair care, which is sufficient for a toddler. The argument here is about differing parenting styles. \n\nThe key points are: the age of the child, the practicality of the request, and the potential impact on the child's self-esteem. At two, children are not old enough to understand or maintain complex hair routines. It's unreasonable to expect a toddler to keep her hair presentable for long. Also, the author's concern about the child not feeling she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair is valid, promoting a healthy self-image.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might think it's important for future grooming habits. But pushing this now might be overstepping. The author is meeting the child's basic needs without overcomplicating. The partner's constant complaints could be seen as not respecting the author's time and the child's age-appropriate needs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a reasonable decision based on the child's age and their own capacity. The partner might need to adjust their expectations. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
