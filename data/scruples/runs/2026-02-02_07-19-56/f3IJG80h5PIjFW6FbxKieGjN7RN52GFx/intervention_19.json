She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend an hour daily on their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The author's partner is pushing for this routine, arguing it's to teach the daughter how to care for her hair in the future. The author doesn't see the necessity, citing the effort, the child's age, and wanting to avoid putting pressure on her to focus on appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's argument is practical: a 2-year-old is too young for such a routine. Their hair will get messed up quickly, and the effort required might not be age-appropriate. Also, the author is concerned about the message it sends\u2014maybe promoting the idea that appearance is important over other values. They also mention the time, money, and effort involved, which is valid when considering the workload.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's reasoning is about teaching a skill for the future. They might believe that starting early helps the daughter learn self-care. However, at two, children aren't capable of maintaining complex hair routines. It's more about the parent's own grooming habits being imposed on the child. The partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting to pass on their own standards, but it's possible they're not considering the child's age and the practicality of the task.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and child development, two-year-olds are in a stage where they're exploring their environment and developing motor skills. Enforcing a grooming routine that's as elaborate as an adult's might not be appropriate. The author is prioritizing the child's needs and practicality, which seems reasonable. The partner's complaints about the author not doing enough might stem from a difference in priorities or misunderstanding the child's developmental stage.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the partner's demands are unreasonable given the child's age, then the author isn't wrong. The author is making a judgment call based on the child's best interests. However, if the partner's intent is purely to teach the skill, but the method is inappropriate, the author is justified in resisting. The key here is whether the partner's request is feasible and appropriate for a toddler. Since it's not, the author isn't in the wrong. They're balancing practicality and child development against the partner's wishes. So the answer is B.\n"
