She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has a 2-year-old daughter with curly hair like hers. The author's own hair routine takes an hour daily and is time-consuming. The partner wants the author to do the same routine for the daughter so she learns to care for her hair later. The author does some parts, like washing and using products, but doesn't spend hours on it. The partner is upset and insists on making the daughter's hair \"presentable,\" while the author thinks it's unnecessary at the daughter's age and doesn't want her to feel like she needs to spend so much time on hair to be beautiful. The author is being criticized for this, but they think they're in the right.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the partner's reasoning: they want the daughter to learn hair care skills for when she's older. But the daughter is only 2. Is it reasonable to expect a 2-year-old to start such a complex routine? Probably not. At that age, children are still developing motor skills and independence. It's more about basic hygiene and maybe some simple habits, not an hour-long routine. The author is doing what's necessary for cleanliness and maybe some maintenance, which seems appropriate.\n\nThe author's argument is that spending hours on a toddler's hair is impractical. The child will just mess it up, and it's not worth the effort. Plus, the author is concerned about the daughter not feeling like her natural hair isn't good enough. That's a valid concern. Teaching a child that their natural state isn't acceptable could have negative effects on self-esteem. The partner's insistence on \"presentable\" might be imposing adult standards on a young child.\n\nAlso, the partner's constant complaints and insistence might be creating unnecessary stress in the household. The author is trying to balance their own time and energy, which is reasonable. The partner's approach could be seen as overbearing, especially if they're not recognizing the impracticality of the situation.\n\nAnother angle: the author is sharing their routine with the daughter, which is part of teaching. But doing the full routine isn't feasible for a toddler. The partner might not understand that. The author is making a judgment call based on the child's age and needs. The partner's complaints might stem from their own values or upbringing, but that doesn't make the author wrong.\n\nHowever, maybe the partner has a point in wanting to introduce care routines early. But again, the age factor is crucial. At 2, it's more about basics. The author is already doing some of the steps, which is sufficient. The partner's insistence on more might be unrealistic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing the child's well-being and practicality over their partner's expectations. The partner's approach could be seen as imposing unnecessary pressure. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
