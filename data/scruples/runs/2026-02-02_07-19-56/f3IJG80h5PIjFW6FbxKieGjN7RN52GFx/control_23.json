She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend hours on their 2-year-old's hair every day. The author has thick, curly hair that takes them an hour to manage. The partner wants the same routine for the daughter so she learns, but the author thinks it's unnecessary at her age.\n\nFirst, the daughter is only 2. At that age, kids are active and mess up their hair easily. The author argues it's pointless to put in so much effort since the kid will ruin it. They also mention the daughter's natural curls are cute and don't want her to feel she needs to spend so much time on hair to be beautiful. That's a valid point about self-image.\n\nThe partner insists on the routine for \"presentability.\" But is presentable hair for a 2-year-old really necessary? Maybe the partner has their own reasons, like cultural expectations or wanting the daughter to follow in the author's footsteps. However, imposing an adult's hair care routine on a toddler could be excessive. The author is also considering the time, money, and effort involved, which are real factors.\n\nThe key here is the partner's constant complaining despite explanations. The author is setting boundaries, which is okay. They're not wrong to prioritize their child's well-being and avoid unnecessary pressure. The partner's insistence might stem from their own values, but the author has the right to disagree. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
