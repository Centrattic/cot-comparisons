She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author's partner keeps pushing them to do the same elaborate hair routine that takes an hour, similar to the author's own routine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They argue that the daughter is only 2, so spending hours on her hair doesn't make sense because she'll just mess it up. Also, they don't want the child to feel like she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful. The partner, on the other hand, wants the daughter to learn proper hair care for when she's older and insists on being \"presentable.\"\n\nFrom a childcare perspective, a 2-year-old is very active and can't maintain a complex hairstyle. The author's concern about setting unrealistic expectations at such a young age is valid. Also, the time and money involved in the routine are significant factors. The partner might be projecting their own values onto the child, possibly instilling unnecessary pressure about appearance at an early age. However, the partner's request is about teaching the daughter skills for the future. But realistically, at 2, the child can't retain or apply these skills yet. The key here is balancing the partner's wishes against the child's age-appropriate needs and the practicality of the situation. The author seems reasonable in not wanting to impose adult standards on a toddler. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
