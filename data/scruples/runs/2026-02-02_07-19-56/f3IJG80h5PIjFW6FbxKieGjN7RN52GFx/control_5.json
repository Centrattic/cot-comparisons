She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The daughter has thick ringlets, and the author's hair routine takes an hour. The partner wants the author to do the same for the daughter so she learns later. The author does some basics but doesn't spend hours on it. The partner is upset when they don't, emphasizing presentation.\n\nHmm, so the key points are the child's age, the time and effort required, the parent's reasoning about the child's age making the routine impractical, and the partner's insistence. The author argues that it's unnecessary for a 2-year-old and doesn't want her to feel pressured about hair. The partner wants her to look presentable.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Well, the question is whether the author's refusal is justified. The author is a parent, and while the partner wants the daughter to learn hair care, the child is very young. At 2 years old, she's not going to maintain the hairstyle for long, and spending an hour daily might be excessive. The author's concern about the child feeling like she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful is valid, promoting self-esteem. The partner's complaint seems to be about appearance, but the author thinks it's not necessary right now. \n\nAlso, the author is already doing some steps like washing, brushing, and leave-in products. The partner's insistence on the full routine might be overstepping, especially since the child is too young to benefit practically. The author's argument about the time and money involved is a valid consideration. So, putting it together, the author's stance seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
