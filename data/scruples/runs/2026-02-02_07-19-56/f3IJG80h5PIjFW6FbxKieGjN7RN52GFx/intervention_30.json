She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's think through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The situation involves a 2-year-old with curly hair, and the author's partner is pushing for the same meticulous routine they do for themselves.\n\nFirst, the author explains that their own hair takes an hour a day. They do some basics for their daughter but don't spend hours. The partner is upset, wanting the daughter to learn hair care now. The author argues that the child is too young, and the effort isn't practical. Also, they don't want the daughter to feel pressured to spend so much time on her hair later.\n\nSo, the key points are: the partner's insistence vs. the parent's practical reasoning. The question is about right or wrong. Legally or morally? Probably morally.\n\nThe author's perspective is about practicality and the child's age. They're concerned about setting unnecessary expectations. The partner wants to teach the importance of grooming. But at 2, can a child really benefit from such a routine? It seems more about the parent's own values. The author might be right that the effort isn't justified now. Also, the partner's constant complaints could be part of the issue, being inconsiderate of the author's time and stress.\n\nBut maybe the author could find a middle ground. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. The author isn't harming the child; they're making a judgment call based on the child's age. The partner's desire is about future benefits, but the author is prioritizing current practicality. So, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
