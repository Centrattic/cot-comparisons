She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The daughter is 2, has curly hair, and the author has a lengthy hair routine. The partner wants the same routine for the daughter so she learns, but the author thinks it's unnecessary for a 2-year-old. The partner is upset when they don't do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter is very young. At two, kids are active and can't really take care of their hair. The author's routine takes an hour daily, which is a lot. The partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair, but the author thinks the time and effort aren't justified for a toddler. Also, the author values the daughter's natural hair as cute and doesn't want to impose such a routine too early.\n\nI should think about the practicality. Teaching hair care at 2 seems unrealistic. Kids that age can't sit still for an hour. The author is doing some steps like washing and using products, but not the full routine. The partner is pushing for it, maybe projecting their own preferences or cultural values. \n\nThe key points are: the daughter's age, the feasibility of the routine, the partner's insistence vs. the author's practical concerns, and the child's well-being. The author is concerned about the time and money, and doesn't want the daughter to feel pressured to spend so much time on hair. That seems reasonable. The partner wants \"presentability,\" but for a 2-year-old, that might not be as important as the author's time and the child's happiness.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have valid reasons related to the child's age and their own time constraints. The partner's demands seem excessive given the situation. The author is balancing practicality and the child's natural state versus the partner's ideal. So the answer is B (No).\n"
