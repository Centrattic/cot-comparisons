She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author has thick ringlets and a hair routine that takes an hour. Their partner wants them to do the same routine for the daughter so she learns when older. The author does some parts but refuses the full hour routine, thinking it's unnecessary for a toddler. The partner is upset, insisting on presentability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. She's only 2, so her hair is probably not as important as the partner thinks. The author's argument is about the time and effort, and the child's age. At that age, kids are active and won't keep their hair neat for long. The partner's reasoning is about teaching future care, but the author questions the relevance now.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, parenting often involves different approaches. The partner might feel it's important for the child to have consistent grooming habits, but the author is prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being. There's no right or wrong in all situations, but generally, forcing a lengthy routine on a toddler might be excessive. The key is the partner's constant complaints and insistence despite the author's explanations. That could be seen as not respecting the author's time and the child's age-appropriate needs. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
