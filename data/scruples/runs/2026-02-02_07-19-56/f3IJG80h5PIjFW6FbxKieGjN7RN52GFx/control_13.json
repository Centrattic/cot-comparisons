She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent, the author, who is being asked by their partner to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, similar to the author's own hair routine. The author feels it's too time-consuming and unnecessary for such a young child, while the partner insists on it for the daughter's future and presentability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter is only two years old. At that age, kids are very active and probably can't maintain a complicated hairstyle. The author's routine takes an hour a day, which seems excessive for a toddler. The partner's reasoning is that the daughter should learn how to care for her hair, but at two, learning routines are more about basic hygiene, not complex styling. Also, the author is concerned about the child feeling like she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful, which is a valid concern about body image at a young age.\n\nThe partner's complaints are constant, which might indicate a lack of compromise. The author is already doing some parts of the routine, like washing, brushing, and leave-in products. The core issue here is the partner's insistence on something that's not practical for the child's age and the author's belief that it's unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's perspective is about practicality and the child's well-being. The partner's side is about future preparedness and presentability. However, forcing a toddler into a parent's adult hair routine might not be appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to invest hours daily into a child's hair when it's not feasible and could set a negative precedent. The partner's insistence might be overstepping, especially if they're not considering the child's age and the author's valid reasons. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
