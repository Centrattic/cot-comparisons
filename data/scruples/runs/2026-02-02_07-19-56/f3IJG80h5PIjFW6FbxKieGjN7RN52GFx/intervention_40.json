She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to spend an hour daily on their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The partner is pushing for this routine so the daughter learns later, but the author finds it unnecessary given the kid's age and the effort involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is practical: a 2-year-old can't maintain such a routine, it's not cost-effective, and they don't want the child to feel pressured about her appearance. The partner's side is about teaching responsibility and ensuring the daughter looks presentable now and in the future.\n\nLegal or ethical wrongs? Probably not a legal issue. It's a family dynamic question. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. At 2, children are too young for complex hair routines. The author is already doing some basic care. The partner's insistence might be overstepping by not considering the child's age and the practicality. However, the partner's concern about teaching proper care might be valid, but the method seems excessive. \n\nThe author isn't harming the child by not doing the full routine. They're making a judgment call based on the child's age. The partner's constant complaints might be the bigger issue here. So, I think the author is not in the wrong because they're balancing practicality and the child's needs against an unrealistic expectation from the partner. Answer B.\n"
