She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day the same way they do their own.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning: their daughter is very young, has curly hair like them, and their own hair routine takes a lot of time and effort. They do some parts of the routine but don't want to spend hours on it because the kid will just mess it up. They also don't want her to feel like she needs to spend so much time on hair to be beautiful. The partner, though, wants the daughter to learn the routine now for when she's older and gets upset when the author doesn't comply.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're balancing practicality and values. They argue that a 2-year-old can't maintain a complicated hairstyle, so spending hours daily is pointless. Also, they want to avoid pressuring the daughter about appearance too early. That seems reasonable. Parenting often involves making decisions based on what's appropriate for the child's age.\n\nOn the partner's side, they want the daughter to be \"presentable\" and learn the routine for the future. Maybe they value grooming and want her to know how to take care of her hair. But is that a valid reason? At 2, learning a complex routine might not be realistic. Plus, the author is already doing parts of the routine, which might be sufficient for now.\n\nAnother angle: the partner's constant complaints and insistence. If the author explains their reasoning and the partner keeps pressuring, maybe the partner isn't respecting the author's viewpoint. The author's decision to prioritize their daughter's well-being by not enforcing a time-consuming routine could be justified.\n\nHowever, could the author be overstepping? If the partner feels strongly about teaching grooming habits early, there might be a cultural or personal value at play. But the daughter is very young. Maybe the partner isn't considering the child's age and maturity level. Also, the author's concern about the daughter feeling she needs to invest time in her hair to feel beautiful is a valid point about body image and self-esteem.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is making a reasonable choice based on their child's age and their own values. The partner's approach might be inflexible. The author isn't refusing all aspects; they're doing some parts. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
