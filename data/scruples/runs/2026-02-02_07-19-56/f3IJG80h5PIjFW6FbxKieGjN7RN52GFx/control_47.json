She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about whether they should do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day the same way they do their own.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2 years old. At that age, kids are very active and probably can't sit still for long. The parent mentions that their own hair routine takes an hour and a lot of effort. They do some parts for the daughter, like washing and brushing, but not the whole thing. The partner wants them to do the full routine so the daughter knows how to care for her hair later. The parent doesn't think it makes sense because the kid will just mess it up, and they don't want her to think she needs to spend hours on her hair to be beautiful. The partner is upset about this.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the age of the daughter, the practicality of doing a long hair routine on a toddler, and the parent's concern about setting unrealistic beauty standards. The partner's argument is about teaching the child presentability and future hair care. \n\nI need to consider if the parent is wrong for not doing the full routine. Since the child is 2, it's reasonable to think that such a detailed routine isn't necessary or feasible. Also, the parent's concern about the message it sends about beauty is valid. The partner's insistence might be overstepping, given the child's age and the impracticality. So, the parent's refusal seems justified, making them not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
