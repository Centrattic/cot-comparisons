She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The situation is that the daughter is 2 years old, has curly hair like the mother, and the mother spends an hour daily on her own hair routine. The partner wants the mother to do the same for the daughter so she learns when older. The mother does some basics but doesn't want to spend hours on it, thinking it's unnecessary for a toddler. The partner is upset when she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mother's reasoning is practical: a 2-year-old can't keep hair styled, and it's time-consuming. She also wants her daughter to feel beautiful without the pressure of spending time on hair. The partner, on the other hand, wants the daughter to learn the routine for later and insists on \"presentable\" appearances.\n\nNow, the mother's actions are reasonable. At 2, kids are active and messy, so spending an hour on hair daily isn't practical. The partner's insistence might stem from a desire to instill habits, but it's not a valid reason here. The mother is doing what's appropriate for her child's age and saving effort. Also, there's a concern about the partner's constant complaints and invalidating the mother's reasons, which could be a red flag in their relationship. The mother isn't neglecting the child; she's making a judgment call based on practicality and the child's well-being. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
