She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend an hour every day doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair as requested by their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter is very young, only two years old. The mother has a complex hair routine that takes an hour. The partner wants the daughter to learn how to care for her hair, so they can do it when she's older. But the author thinks it's not necessary to spend so much time on a toddler's hair because she'll just ruin it, and they don't want her to feel like she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful. The partner is upset that the author isn't doing the full routine, even though the author is doing some parts and explaining the effort involved.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the practicality of the routine for a toddler, and the underlying values each parent is emphasizing. The partner wants the child to be presentable and learn hair care early, while the author is concerned about the child's well-being and not imposing beauty standards too early.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a parenting disagreement. Neither approach is inherently wrong, but the partner's insistence might be overbearing, and the author's refusal is based on valid concerns about the child's age and their values. The author is making a judgment call that's in their child's best interest, considering her age and the potential pressure on her. The partner might be projecting their own preferences onto the child. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's needs and their own time, especially since the child is too young for such a routine. So, the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
