She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The daughter has thick ringlets, and the parent has a hair routine that takes an hour. The partner wants the daughter to learn the routine now for when she's older, but the parent thinks it's unnecessary because the kid is too young and the hair will just get messed up. Plus, the parent doesn't want the daughter to feel pressure about her hair.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the age of the child, the parent's perspective, the partner's demands, and the reasoning given. At 2 years old, a child is very active and their hair isn't going to stay styled for long. The effort required for the routine is significant, and the parent is concerned about instilling unnecessary pressure on the child regarding appearance. The partner, on the other hand, wants the daughter to be \"presentable\" and to learn the routine early.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong (A) or not (B). To decide, I need to consider child development, parental responsibilities, and the partner's expectations. At such a young age, it's reasonable to prioritize practicality over aesthetics. The parent is already doing some basic care steps. The partner's insistence might stem from their own values or appearance standards, but forcing a lengthy routine on a toddler seems excessive. Additionally, the parent's concern about the child's self-image is valid\u2014teaching that beauty requires effort might not be appropriate now.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of shared parenting responsibilities. The partner might feel that learning hair care is important for the daughter's future. But the parent's argument about the impracticality for a 2-year-old is strong. The time and money involved are factors too. The parent isn't refusing entirely but is doing some parts. The partner's constant complaints might indicate a lack of flexibility or understanding of the parent's perspective.\n\nI think the parent isn't wrong here. The child's age and activity level make daily intensive hair care unrealistic. The parent's reasoning about not wanting the daughter to feel pressured is also a valid concern. The partner's insistence seems to be overstepping. So, the answer should be B.\n"
