She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The situation involves the author's opinion versus their partner's.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: Their daughter is very young, has curly hair, and their own hair routine takes an hour. They do some basic care but think it's unnecessary to put in so much effort for a toddler who will mess it up. They also don't want the daughter to feel pressured about her appearance. The partner, on the other hand, wants the author to do the full routine to teach the daughter hair care for the future and insists on presentability.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age of the child, the practicality of the routine, and the differing values between the parents. The author is concerned about the time, effort, and the message it sends, while the partner values teaching the daughter a routine now for future use.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, parenting decisions often involve balancing different priorities. At two years old, most kids aren't expected to maintain elaborate hairstyles. The author is providing basic care, which is sufficient for a toddler. The partner's insistence might stem from a desire to instill habits, but it's important to consider the child's age and natural behavior. Also, the author's concern about the message of beauty standards is valid. The partner is being pushy about it, which could lead to conflict in the relationship. \n\nFrom a general standpoint, parents should support each other's roles, but there's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, since the author is already doing some of the necessary steps and the partner is overstepping by being insistent, the author might not be in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to the child's age and their own capacity. The partner's demands might be unrealistic given the situation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
