She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The daughter has thick ringlets like them, and their own hair routine takes an hour. The partner wants the daughter to learn the routine for when she's older. The parent does some basics but doesn't spend hours on it, since the kid is just going to mess it up. The partner is upset, saying the daughter should look presentable.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that a 2-year-old doesn't need that much effort, and they don't want the kid to think she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful. The partner disagrees, emphasizing \"presentable\" and the learning aspect. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the child is very young. At 2, toddlers are pretty active and can't maintain a complex hairstyle. Spending an hour daily on a child's hair might be excessive and impractical. Plus, the parent is concerned about the child's self-image, which is a valid point. Beauty standards at such a young age can be harmful. The partner's insistence could be coming from a place of wanting to instill grooming habits, but maybe they're not considering the child's age and the effort involved. \n\nThe author isn't refusing to do any hair care; they do washing, brushing, and leave-in products. The extra time and money might not be justified here. The partner's complaints seem to be about not dedicating the same time as the author does for themselves, which might not be necessary for a toddler. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're balancing practicality and the child's well-being. Answer B.\n"
