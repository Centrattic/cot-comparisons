      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author has a 2-year-old daughter with thick ringlets, similar to the author's own hair. The author's hair routine takes at least an hour each day to get it looking presentable. The partner keeps asking the author to do the same routine for the daughter to teach her how to care for her hair when she's older. The author does some parts, like washing and brushing, but doesn't spend hours on it. The partner is upset and insists that the daughter should be presentable, while the author thinks it doesn't make sense to invest so much time when the kid will just mess it up, and also wants her to not feel the need to spend hours on hair to be beautiful.\n\nFirst, the author's argument: The daughter is 2, so expecting her to have a complex hair routine daily might be impractical. Toddlers are active and their hair gets messed up easily. The author is concerned that instilling the idea that beauty requires a lot of time and effort might be harmful. That's a valid point about self-esteem and societal expectations. Also, the time and money involved are significant, which the author is trying to communicate to the partner but isn't being heard.\n\nPartner's perspective: Wants the daughter to learn early how to take care of her hair. The partner might think that establishing good habits now will help her later. But the partner is insisting on a full routine, not just the basics. The constant complaints even after the author explains the time and effort could indicate a lack of understanding or maybe a deeper issue about control or expectations.\n\nNow, the question is, is the author in the wrong? The author is not doing the same lengthy routine as their own. The partner might feel that the daughter's hair isn't being maintained to the same standard. But at 2 years old, is it reasonable to expect the same routine? Probably not. The author is providing the necessary care (washing, brushing, leave-in products), which are the basics. The partner's insistence on spending hours daily on a toddler's hair seems excessive. Also, the author's reasoning about not wanting the child to feel she needs to work hard to look beautiful is a good point. Societal norms often pressure women to maintain certain appearances, so the author is trying to avoid that.\n\nAnother angle: The partner might not be considering the child's age and behavior. A 2-year-old can't sit still for an hour, and the routine might be more about the parent's standards than the child's needs. The author is also considering the child's well-being by not making her feel like she needs to meet those standards. The partner could be projecting their own values or upbringing onto the child, which might not be in the child's best interest.\n\nPossible AITA factors: The author's refusal isn't harmful to the child, as basic care is still provided. The partner's constant complaints might be the issue here, not the author's stance. The author is justifying their position with reasoning about the child's age and the message it sends, which is reasonable. So, the answer would likely be B (author is not in the wrong). However, I should check if there's any obligation in the parent's dynamic that might make it A. But since the partner is the one demanding it, and the author is explaining the reasons, and the partner isn't listening, the problem seems more with the partner's insistence than the author's refusal.\n"
