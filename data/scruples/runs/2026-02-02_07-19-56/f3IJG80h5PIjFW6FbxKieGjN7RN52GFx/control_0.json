She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The daughter has thick ringlets, and the author's own hair routine takes an hour. The partner wants the author to do the same for the daughter, so she learns when older. The author does some basics but refuses to spend hours on it, thinking it's pointless since the kid will mess it up anyway. The partner keeps complaining.\n\nSo, the question is about right and wrong here. The author is the parent, and the partner is the other parent. The author is saying they don't want to do the hair routine daily. The partner is pushing for it. The user wants to know if the author is at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's reasoning: the daughter is 2, so putting hours into her hair isn't practical. Also, they don't want the child to feel she needs to spend a lot of time on hair to be beautiful. That seems like a valid concern about self-esteem later. The time and money involved are also factors. The partner's argument is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair and making her look presentable.\n\nNow, evaluating who is right. Parenting decisions often involve differing opinions. The partner's insistence might stem from a desire for the daughter to have good habits. However, the author is concerned about the practicality and the message it sends. At two years old, expecting a daily intensive hair routine might be unrealistic. The author is already doing some basics, which is sufficient for a toddler. The partner's constant complaints might be overstepping, especially if the author is explaining the reasons. The author's stance seems reasonable, prioritizing the child's well-being and practicality over the partner's expectations. The partner's insistence without considering the child's age and the long-term message might be the issue here. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
