She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The situation involves the author's partner wanting them to follow a hair routine similar to their own, which takes an hour a day. The author argues that it's impractical for a toddler and doesn't want the child to feel pressured about hair care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, a child is very active and might not stay still or care about hair presentation. The author's routine is time-consuming and expensive, which seems excessive for a toddler who will likely mess it up quickly. The partner's insistence here might not be considering the child's developmental stage.\n\nThe author's perspective is about practicality and not imposing unnecessary expectations on a young child. They also mention that the daughter's natural hair is cute, so maybe there's a point about embracing natural beauty without pressure. The partner's concern is about teaching proper hair care for the future, but at 2, is it really the right time to start such a routine? \n\nI should also think about the parent's role. Both parents might have different parenting styles. The author is prioritizing the child's comfort and practicality, while the partner is focusing on long-term habits. The key here is whether the author is wrong for not following the partner's request. Since the child is very young, the author's reasoning seems valid. There's no obligation to do something that's not necessary for the child's well-being and might cause unnecessary stress. The partner's complaints might be overstepping, especially if it's causing conflict. \n\nAlso, the author is already doing some hair care steps like washing and using products. The partner wants more, but the author feels the time and money aren't justified. It's a difference in priorities. The author isn't neglecting the child, just not following an elaborate routine. So, in this case, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer is likely B.\n"
