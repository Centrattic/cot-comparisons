She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for not wanting to spend an hour on their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author explains that their own hair routine takes a lot of time and effort, and they think it's unnecessary for a toddler. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care for when she's older, but the author feels it's impractical and doesn't want the child to feel pressured about her appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, she's still very young, and her hair is going to get messed up quickly regardless. The author's argument that putting hours into her hair is impractical makes sense here. Also, the concern about the child feeling like she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to feel beautiful is a valid point about self-esteem and societal pressures.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's intention is to teach her hair care skills for the future. However, the author is the one who has a complex routine, so expecting a toddler to follow that seems unrealistic. The partner's constant complaints despite explanations might indicate a lack of understanding of the author's perspective and the child's developmental stage.\n\nThe key factors here are the child's age, the practicality of the routine, and the importance of not instilling unnecessary beauty standards. The author's reasoning seems reasonable. They are balancing practicality with their daughter's well-being. The partner's insistence without considering these factors might be the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they are making a judgment based on their child's needs and their own circumstances.\n"
