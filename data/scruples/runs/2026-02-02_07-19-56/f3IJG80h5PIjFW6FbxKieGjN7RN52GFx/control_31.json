She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day for an hour. The partner wants the routine to teach the daughter how to care for her hair later. The author feels it's unnecessary because the kid is too young, and the effort isn't worth it, plus it takes time and money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning: a 2-year-old can't maintain a complex hair routine, and putting hours into it is impractical. Also, they don't want to send the message that beauty requires excessive time, which might be a valid point about self-esteem. The partner's side is about teaching future skills and ensuring the child looks presentable. But the partner is complaining constantly, which might be part of the issue.\n\nIs there an obligation to do this? Well, the child is very young, so maybe the partner's expectations are unrealistic. The author is already doing some basic care, which might be sufficient. The partner's insistence could be overstepping, especially if they're not considering the child's age. The author's concern about the time and money is practical. Also, the author is a parent, so they have the right to decide what's appropriate for their child's upbringing. The partner's constant complaints might be the real problem here. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a judgment based on their child's age and practicality. The partner might need to adjust their expectations.\n"
