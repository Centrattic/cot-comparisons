She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The daughter has thick curly hair, and the parent (the author) spends an hour daily on their own hair. The partner wants the daughter to learn the routine for when she's older, but the author thinks it's too much for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel like she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Two years old is very young. Their hair isn't going to stay styled for long, and they're still developing their habits. The author's argument is that it's impractical and unnecessary. The partner, on the other hand, wants the daughter to look presentable and learn the routine early. \n\nBut wait, is there a cultural or personal expectation here? Maybe the partner has their own reasons, like coming from a background where hair care is important. The author is balancing their own time and effort versus the partner's expectations. The author is also concerned about the message it sends to the daughter about beauty standards. That's a valid point. \n\nThe author does do some parts of the routine, like washing and using products, but not the full hour. The partner is upset about this. The key issue here is whether the author is being negligent or if the partner is being unreasonable. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the child is too young, and the effort required isn't practical. Teaching hair care can start later when the child is older and can understand and maintain it. The author's concern about not pressuring the daughter into thinking she needs to look a certain way is also a good point. The partner might be overstepping by expecting the same routine as an adult. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
