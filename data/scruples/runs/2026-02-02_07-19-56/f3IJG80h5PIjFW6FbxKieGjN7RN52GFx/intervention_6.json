She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're at fault for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, as requested by their partner.\n\nFirst, the daughter is just two years old. At that age, kids are very active and probably won't keep their hair in a neat style for long. The author mentions that their own hair routine takes an hour a day, which seems like a lot. The partner wants the daughter to learn the care routine now for when she's older. But does a two-year-old really need the same kind of intensive treatment? It seems impractical because the child's hair would just get messed up quickly, and the time invested might not be worth it.\n\nThe author does some basic steps like washing, brushing, and using leave-in products. That's probably enough for a toddler. The partner's insistence on doing the full routine might be coming from a place of wanting the daughter to have good hair care habits. However, the author has valid points about the time and money involved. Also, they don't want the child to feel pressured to spend so much time on her hair to feel beautiful, which is a good point about body image and self-esteem.\n\nThe partner is complaining constantly, which could be a sign of not respecting the author's time and the child's age-appropriate needs. The author is trying to balance practicality with the partner's expectations. Maybe the partner is overestimating the necessity of the routine for a young child. The key here is whether the partner's demands are reasonable given the child's age and the practical challenges. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries here. They're prioritizing the child's well-being and their own time. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
