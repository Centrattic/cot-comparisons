She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day for an hour, similar to their own routine. The partner is pushing for it, saying it's to teach the daughter how to care for her hair when she's older. The parent does some basic care but thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler, and also doesn't want the kid to feel she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful. The partner is upset when the parent doesn't do the full routine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. She's 2 years old. At that age, children are very active, and their hair is not something they can manage themselves yet. Teaching a 2-year-old complex hair routines might not be practical. The parent's argument is that it's impractical and that the kid's natural hair is cute, so there's no need to enforce a strict routine. Also, they don't want the child to associate beauty with time and money spent on hair at such a young age.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair as she grows up. But at 2 years old, would learning an hour-long routine really be beneficial? It seems like the partner might be projecting their own preferences or experiences onto the child. Maybe the partner has their own reasons for wanting the daughter to look presentable, but the parent is concerned about the child's well-being and not imposing adult standards too early.\n\nThe parent is doing some basic grooming like washing, brushing, and leave-in products, which are reasonable for a toddler. The partner, however, is insistent and complains, which adds stress. The parent is trying to explain the effort and cost involved, which the partner isn't respecting. The parent's stance seems reasonable because the child is too young for such a rigorous routine. It's about balancing practicality with the child's needs versus the parent's or partner's expectations.\n\nAlso, the concern about the child feeling that she needs to dedicate time to her hair to be beautiful is valid. Teaching body positivity and self-acceptance from a young age is important. The parent wants the child to be comfortable with her natural appearance, which is a healthy approach. The partner's insistence might be imposing unrealistic standards or their own insecurities onto the child.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should share in child-rearing duties, but this isn't a typical chore. It's more about grooming and beauty standards. The parent is questioning the necessity and the partner is pushing for it. There's a conflict between practical considerations and the partner's expectations. The parent's refusal isn't neglectful; they're doing what's developmentally appropriate for a toddler.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're making a judgment based on the child's age and well-being. The partner might need to reconsider the feasibility and appropriateness of their request for a 2-year-old. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
