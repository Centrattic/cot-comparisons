She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent, the author, who is a parent to a 2-year-old daughter with curly hair like hers. The author's hair routine takes an hour daily, and her partner wants her to do the same for the daughter so she learns hair care later. The author does some basics but refuses to spend hours on it, thinking it's unnecessary for a 2-year-old. The partner is upset, insisting on making the daughter look presentable.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are the age of the child, the effort required, and the partner's insistence. The author's reasoning is that a 2-year-old can't maintain elaborate hairstyles, and the cute natural hair is better. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care for future, but the author thinks the daughter shouldn't feel pressured to spend time on hair to be beautiful.\n\nFrom a child-rearing perspective, 2 is very young. At that age, kids are active and their hair naturally gets messy. Teaching hair care might be premature. The author is balancing practicality and the child's well-being. The partner's demand might be unrealistic given the child's age. Also, the author is concerned about instilling a sense of beauty linked to effort, which is a valid point about self-esteem.\n\nThe partner's insistence could be seen as overreaching, especially if they're not considering the child's age and practicality. The author is not neglecting the child; they're doing basic care. The time and money issue is a real concern. So, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to do an hour-long routine for a toddler. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
