She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The parent has thick hair that takes an hour to manage and is being asked by their partner to do the same for the daughter. The parent does some basic care but doesn't want to spend hours on it, thinking it's unnecessary at the daughter's age. The partner is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The daughter is only two years old, so her hair is probably not going to stay neat for long. The parent is spending a significant amount of time and money on their own hair, which is understandable. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care habits early, but is the partner's insistence reasonable here?\n\nThe parent argues that it's impractical for a toddler to have such a routine. Toddlers are active, so even if you spend time on their hair, it's likely to get messed up quickly. Also, the parent doesn't want the daughter to feel that she needs to dedicate so much time to her appearance to be beautiful. That seems like a valid concern about self-esteem.\n\nThe partner's motivation is for the daughter to know how to care for her hair when she's older. But at two years old, can she really learn the skills needed? Maybe not. It might be more about the parent's own routines and expectations. The partner is upset when the parent doesn't do it, despite the parent's explanations about time and effort.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, they are setting boundaries regarding their time and resources. They are also considering the daughter's age and natural behavior. The partner's insistence seems excessive if the daughter is too young to benefit from the routine. The parent's reasoning seems logical and considerate of the child's needs. So, the answer is probably B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
