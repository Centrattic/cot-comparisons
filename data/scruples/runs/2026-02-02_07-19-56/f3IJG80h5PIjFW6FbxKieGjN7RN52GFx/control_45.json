She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author has a complicated hair routine that takes an hour and costs money. The partner insists on doing the same for the daughter to teach her later, but the author thinks it's unnecessary since the kid is active and it's just a cute mop top.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2 years old, she's very young and likely can't sit still for an hour-long routine. The author is already doing some basics like washing and brushing. The partner's request seems to be about grooming habits for the future, but the author is concerned about the effort and the message it sends about beauty standards.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the practicality of the routine, and the underlying values each parent holds. The author's stance is about not imposing excessive beauty standards on a toddler, which is a valid concern. The partner's argument is about teaching presentability, but maybe they're projecting their own standards onto the child unnecessarily. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the time and money involved. Since the daughter is active, the effort might be wasted. The partner's constant complaints despite explanations could be seen as not respecting the author's perspective. So, the author's refusal isn't without reason. They're prioritizing the child's well-being and practicality over the partner's demands. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should collaborate. The partner's insistence might be overstepping, especially when the author is already contributing. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
