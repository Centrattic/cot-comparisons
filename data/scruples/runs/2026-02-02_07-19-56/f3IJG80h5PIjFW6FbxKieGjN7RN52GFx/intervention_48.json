She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The daughter is two years old, and the parent has a complicated hair routine. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care from an early age, but the author thinks it's unreasonable given the child's age and the effort involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter is very young, so maintaining a daily hair routine might not be practical. Kids at two are active and messy, so spending an hour on hair each day could be challenging. The author's argument is that it's unnecessary and might pressure the child into thinking she needs to spend a lot of time on her appearance. The partner, on the other hand, wants the daughter to be presentable and to learn the routine early.\n\nThe author is doing some aspects of the routine, like washing and using leave-in products. The partner is upset when the author doesn't do the full routine. The question is whether the author is wrong for refusing to do the full routine daily.\n\nI should think about the child's age and practicality. At two, a child's hair doesn't require the same level of care as an adult's, especially if they're active. The author might be right in not enforcing a strict routine that's more suitable for adults. Also, the concern about the child feeling the need to spend time on her hair to feel beautiful is valid from a self-esteem perspective. Teaching grooming skills is one thing, but imposing an adult-level routine on a toddler might be excessive.\n\nHowever, the partner's point about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair for the future is a consideration. But given the age, maybe the partner is being unrealistic. The author is balancing practicality with the child's well-being. The partner's insistence despite the author's explanations suggests a possible lack of understanding of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They are making a reasonable judgment based on their child's age and the practical aspects of daily routines. The partner's expectations might not be age-appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
