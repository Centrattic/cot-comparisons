She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent (the author) who doesn't want to spend an hour daily on their 2-year-old daughter's hair, similar to their own routine. The partner insists on it for the daughter's future hair care skills.\n\nFirst, the daughter is only 2. At that age, kids are active and might not stay still, so spending an hour on hair might be impractical. The author argues it's unnecessary and that the daughter's natural hair is cute. They also don't want the child to feel pressured to spend so much time on hair to be beautiful. Those are valid points about age-appropriateness and body image.\n\nThe partner's side is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair. But does a 2-year-old really need to learn that? It seems more like the partner's own preferences are driving the request. The author explains the time, effort, and money involved, which the partner doesn't seem to acknowledge. The partner's constant complaints might be the bigger issue here.\n\nThe author is balancing practicality against the partner's wishes. Since the child is very young, the author's stance seems reasonable. Pressuring a toddler to have a complex hair routine could be more about the parents' expectations than the child's needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a judgment call based on the child's age and their own values.\n"
