She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to spend an hour each day on their 2-year-old daughter's hair, as their partner insists. The partner's reasoning is to teach the daughter how to care for her hair when she's older and to look presentable. The author feels that the effort is unnecessary for a young child and wants her to feel that she doesn't need to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is about practicality and the child's age. At 2 years old, a child is very active and probably can't maintain a complex hairstyle. The author also mentions that their own routine takes an hour and requires specific products, which might be impractical for a toddler. Additionally, there's a concern about instilling a message about beauty and self-worth that doesn't require excessive time and effort. That seems like a valid point about body image and self-esteem.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's perspective is about preparation. They want the daughter to learn hair care skills early, which could be helpful later on. They also emphasize looking presentable, which might relate to their personal values or cultural norms. However, the partner is complaining constantly, which could indicate a lack of compromise or understanding.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the child's age and the reasons behind each partner's stance. At 2, it's unreasonable to expect a child to maintain an elaborate hairstyle. The effort required might not be suitable for a toddler's lifestyle. The author is also trying to avoid sending a message that beauty requires a lot of work, which is a positive intention. The partner's insistence might stem from a different view on grooming and preparation for the future, but applying adult standards to a 2-year-old could be excessive.\n\nAnother angle is the parent's own time and energy. The author has their own routine that's time-consuming. Adding the same routine for a child might be overwhelming. It's important for parents to balance their partner's expectations with their own capacity and the child's needs. The author is already doing some aspects of hair care, like washing and using leave-in products, which might be sufficient for a toddler.\n\nIn terms of AITA, being in the wrong usually involves a clear ethical or relational mistake. In this case, the author is not being negligent in the child's care. The partner's expectations might be unrealistic given the child's age. The author's reasoning is practical and considers the child's well-being and self-image, which are important. The partner's constant complaints might indicate a need for communication and compromise rather than assigning blame to the author.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making age-appropriate decisions for their daughter and managing their own time and energy. The partner might need to adjust their expectations rather than insisting on a routine that's not feasible for a 2-year-old. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
