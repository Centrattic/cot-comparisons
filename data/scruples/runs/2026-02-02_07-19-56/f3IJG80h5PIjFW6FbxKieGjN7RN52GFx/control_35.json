She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author's daughter is 2 years old, and the author feels that doing her hair every day, which takes an hour, is unnecessary. The partner wants the author to do the same hair routine for the daughter so she learns when she's older. The author does some parts but doesn't do the full hour routine, arguing that the time investment isn't worth it for a 2-year-old who will mess it up anyway. The partner is upset and wants her to look presentable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning is that a 2-year-old doesn't need such a rigorous routine, and it's impractical. Also, they don't want the daughter to feel like she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful. On the other hand, the partner's concern is about teaching the daughter proper hair care for the future and maintaining a presentable appearance.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, parenting can be subjective. The author's stance is about practicality and not instilling unnecessary pressure on a young child. The partner's view is about preparation and social presentation. The author isn't refusing to do any care; they do washing, brushing, and leave-in products. It's just not the full hour routine. The question is whether that's a valid reason for the partner's complaint.\n\nThe author might be in the right because the child's age makes the routine excessive. At 2, kids are active and not concerned with appearance standards. The parent's concern about teaching unnecessary habits and the time/money involved could be justified. The partner's insistence might be overstepping, especially if the author is already doing some care. The author's reasoning about the daughter's well-being and avoiding pressure is a valid point. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
