She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day because it's time-consuming and impractical. The partner keeps pushing for it, saying it's to teach the daughter how to care for her hair in the future. The author does some basics but refuses to spend hours on it, thinking it's unnecessary at this age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is practical: a 2-year-old can't keep hair neat for long, and it's just too much work. They also don't want the daughter to feel pressure about her appearance. On the other hand, the partner wants consistency, maybe to set a routine for later, and values looking presentable. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, parenting styles can vary. The author's reasoning seems valid. At two years old, the child is too young for such detailed routines. It's unrealistic to expect a toddler to maintain styled hair. Plus, the author is concerned about the child's self-image, which is a good point. The partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting the best for the child's future, but maybe they're overreaching given the child's age.\n\nI need to check if there's any cultural context or norms I'm missing. In some cultures, grooming might be emphasized more from a young age. However, the author's argument about practicality and the child's age is strong. Also, the partner's constant complaints despite the author's explanations might indicate a lack of understanding or empathy towards the effort involved.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid points about age-appropriateness and the impracticality of the request. The partner's stance might be well-intentioned but misguided in this context. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
