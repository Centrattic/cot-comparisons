She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The daughter is 2, and the author has a complex hair routine that takes an hour. The partner wants the same done for the daughter to teach her future care, but the author thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel pressured about hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's reasoning includes the time and effort required, the child's age making the routine impractical, and concerns about the child's self-image. The partner's side is about teaching proper hair care and presentability.\n\nI should think about child development. At 2 years old, kids are very active, and maintaining a complex hairstyle might not be feasible. Also, the author mentions that the daughter's natural hair is cute, so maybe the partner's insistence is more about aesthetics than actual health or care. \n\nThere's also the aspect of gender roles. The author is a parent (possibly the mother, given the context of hair care) and the partner might be projecting traditional expectations onto the child. The author's resistance could be about not wanting to enforce such norms on a young girl.\n\nThe partner's constant complaints might be causing stress, but the author is setting a boundary. Is it reasonable to expect a parent to spend an hour daily on a toddler's hair? Probably not. The child's well-being and the parent's time management are factors here.\n\nThe key points are the child's age, practicality, and the message it sends about beauty standards. The author's stance seems reasonable. The partner's request might be overreaching, expecting a toddler to have the same hair routine as an adult. So, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
