She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent not wanting to spend hours on their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The partner is pushing for it, saying it's to teach the daughter how to care for her hair as she grows up. The author argues that it's impractical for a toddler, and they don't want her to feel like she needs to put in so much effort to be beautiful. The partner is upset when the author doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is 2 years old, which is very young. At that age, kids are active and their hair isn't going to stay styled for long. The author's routine takes an hour and is time-consuming and costly. The partner's reasoning is about teaching the daughter hair care, but is that realistic for a toddler? Also, the author's concern about the daughter's self-esteem is valid\u2014why should she feel she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful? \n\nThe partner's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting to instill grooming habits, but maybe they're overestimating what a 2-year-old can learn from this. It's also possible the partner is projecting their own values or preferences onto the child. The author, on the other hand, is prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being. \n\nAnother angle: shared responsibility. The author is doing some parts of the routine but not the entire hour. The partner's constant complaints might be about control or differing parenting styles. The author's stance seems reasonable given the age of the child. The time and money involved are significant, and there's no clear benefit to doing it for a toddler. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a practical decision based on the child's age and their own values. The partner's demands seem excessive and possibly influenced by their own preferences rather than the child's needs. The answer should be B.\n"
