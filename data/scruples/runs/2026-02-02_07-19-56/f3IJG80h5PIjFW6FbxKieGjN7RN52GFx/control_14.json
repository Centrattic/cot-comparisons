She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) not wanting to spend an hour every day doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair as their partner insists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's hair routine takes an hour and a lot of effort. They do some basic care for the daughter but don't commit to the same intensive routine. The partner argues that this teaches the daughter how to care for her hair as she grows up. The author thinks it's unnecessary at 2 years old, as the kid will mess it up anyway, and they don't want her to feel pressure about her hair. The partner is upset about it, emphasizing the daughter's appearance being \"presentable.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider both sides. The partner's concern is about teaching proper hair care. But the child is very young, and it's reasonable to think that such a strict routine isn't practical at this age. Also, the author's argument about not wanting the daughter to feel she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful is a valid point about self-esteem. \n\nThe author is a parent, so their decision should be in the child's best interest. At 2, kids are active and their hair naturally messy. The time investment might not be appropriate. The partner's insistence might be overstepping, especially if the author is already doing the necessary steps without the extra effort. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the time, effort, and money involved. It's reasonable for them to prioritize their own resources. The partner's constant complaints could be seen as unreasonable given the child's age and the impracticality of the request. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasoning is valid, and the partner's expectations might be unrealistic for a toddler. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
