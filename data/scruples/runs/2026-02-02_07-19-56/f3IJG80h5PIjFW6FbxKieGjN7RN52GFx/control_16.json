She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to spend an hour every day doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The daughter has thick ringlets, similar to the parent's own hair which takes an hour to manage. The partner wants the daughter to learn the routine early, but the parent thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel like she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful.\n\nFirst, the age factor is important. A two-year-old is still very young and active. Their hair isn't going to stay done for long, so spending an hour daily might not be practical. The parent is already doing some basic care like washing, brushing, and using leave-in products, which seems sufficient for a toddler's needs. \n\nThe partner's concern is about teaching the daughter for the future. But realistically, a two-year-old isn't going to remember or benefit from the routine. Plus, the parent's argument about not wanting the child to associate beauty with excessive hair care is valid. It's promoting a healthy self-image, which is important.\n\nThe partner's constant complaints and insistence might be overstepping. The parent is under no obligation to spend that much time on a toddler's hair when it's impractical and not beneficial right now. The parent's time and energy are also valid considerations here.\n\nSo, considering the child's age, the impracticality, and the parent's valid concerns about the child's self-image, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing what's reasonable for a toddler and their own well-being.\n"
