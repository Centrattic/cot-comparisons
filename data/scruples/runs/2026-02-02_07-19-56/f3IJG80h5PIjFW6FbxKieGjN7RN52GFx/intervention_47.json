She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The author has thick hair that takes an hour to manage daily. Their partner wants them to do the same for the daughter so she learns how to care for her hair later. The author does some basics but refuses the full routine, thinking it's unnecessary for a toddler. The partner is upset about this.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the daughter's age (2 years old), the time and effort required, the partner's insistence on teaching hair care, the author's concerns about the child not needing such a routine yet. The author also mentions that the partner wants the daughter to look \"presentable,\" which the author disagrees with. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're prioritizing practicality. A 2-year-old is active and likely to mess up her hair regardless. Plus, teaching hair care at this age might be premature. The author also wants the daughter to feel beautiful without feeling pressured to spend hours on her appearance. That seems reasonable, promoting body positivity from an early age.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's argument is about teaching future skills. But does a 2-year-old really need to learn complex hair care? It might not be age-appropriate. The partner's insistence could stem from their own values or experiences, but pushing a time-consuming routine on a toddler might not be the best use of time. Also, the author is spending time and money on this, which adds stress.\n\nThe author is explaining their reasons, which they've tried to communicate to the partner. The partner, however, keeps complaining despite these explanations. The author isn't refusing entirely but is doing some parts. The main conflict is the partner's expectations versus the author's practical approach.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a judgment call based on their child's age and developmental stage. It's about balancing practicality with the partner's wishes. The partner might need to adjust their expectations, as expecting a toddler to maintain adult-level hair care isn't realistic. The author's stance on not wanting the child to feel pressured about her looks is also a positive parenting aspect. So the answer is likely B.\n"
