She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to spend hours doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter is very young, only 2 years old. The author has a hair routine that takes an hour and is complicated. The partner wants the author to do the same for the daughter, so she can learn when older. But the author thinks it's unnecessary at this age and doesn't want the child to feel pressure about her hair.\n\nThe partner is upset when the author doesn't comply, even after explanations. The question is about whether the author is wrong for refusing.\n\nI should think about the age of the child. At 2, kids are active and their hair gets messed up quickly. It might not make sense to do an adult-style routine. Also, the author's point about the child feeling she needs to spend a lot of time on her hair to be beautiful is a good one. Teaching that at two might be pushing unnecessary adult standards.\n\nThe partner wants the daughter to be \"presentable,\" but the author disagrees. The key is whether the partner's request is reasonable. Since the child is so young, maybe the partner is being unrealistic. Also, the author is managing their own time and energy, which is important in parenting.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to the child's age and avoiding unnecessary pressure. The partner's insistence might be overstepping. So the answer is B.\n"
