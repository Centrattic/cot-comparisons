She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to do their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day. The scenario involves the author's partner repeatedly requesting that they follow the same hair care routine for the daughter as they do for themselves, which takes a lot of time and effort. The author does some of the basic steps but feels it's unnecessary for a 2-year-old, who will just mess it up anyway. The partner is insistent, and the author is questioned if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is very young, only 2 years old. At that age, toddlers are active and their hair isn't going to stay styled for long, so the effort put into daily styling might be impractical. The author is concerned about the time and money involved, which are valid considerations. They also mention wanting the daughter to feel beautiful without the pressure of maintaining elaborate hairstyles, which could be seen as a positive parenting perspective\u2014teaching self-worth beyond appearance.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's insistence on \"presentable\" looks might stem from their own values or cultural expectations. However, it's important to question if this insistence is reasonable for a toddler. The author is not refusing to do any hair care; they are doing washing, brushing, and applying leave-in products, which are basic hygiene steps. The partner's complaints could be seen as overreaching, especially when the author explains the effort involved.\n\nThe author's reasoning seems practical and child-centered. They are prioritizing the child's well-being and realistic expectations for her age. The partner's demands might be more about their own preferences rather than the child's needs. The author is not neglecting the child's hygiene but is making a judgment call about what's appropriate for her age.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is making a reasonable decision based on the child's age and the impracticality of the routine. The partner's insistence might be the issue here. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
