She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not wanting to spend hours doing their 2-year-old daughter's hair every day, similar to their own time-consuming routine.\n\nFirst, the parent's argument is that their own hair takes an hour a day and a lot of effort. They do some basic care for the daughter, like washing, brushing, and leave-in products. The partner wants the parent to do the same elaborate routine for the daughter to teach her how to care for her hair in the future. The parent doesn't think it's necessary for a 2-year-old and feels it's excessive since the child will just mess it up anyway. They also don't want the daughter to think she needs to spend so much time on her hair to be beautiful.\n\nThe partner is unhappy and insists on the routine, emphasizing \"presentable\" looks. The question is whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong.\n\nSo, factors to consider: the age of the child (2 years old), the reasonableness of the partner's request, the parent's perspective on teaching beauty standards, and the practicality of the situation. \n\nAt 2, kids are very active and it's unrealistic to maintain elaborate hairstyles daily. The parent is doing some basic care, which might be sufficient. The partner's insistence could be coming from a place of wanting to instill certain habits early, but maybe not considering the child's age and behavior. The parent's concern about the daughter feeling she must spend time on hair to be beautiful could be valid, addressing body image issues early.\n\nThe partner's complaints when the routine isn't followed might indicate a lack of understanding of the parent's effort and the practicality of the situation. The parent is balancing effort with what's appropriate for the child's age. The answer might hinge on whether the partner's demands are unreasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? The parent is not forcing the routine; they're explaining their reasoning. The partner is pushing for something that's impractical and possibly age-inappropriate. Therefore, the parent is justified in their stance. So the answer is B.\n"
