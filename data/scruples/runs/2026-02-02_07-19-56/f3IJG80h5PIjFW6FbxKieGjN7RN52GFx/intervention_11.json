She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The scenario is about a parent not wanting to spend an hour a day on their 2-year-old's hair, similar to their own routine. The partner is pushing for it so the daughter learns later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning: the daughter is young, the hair is cute as is, and putting in so much effort is unnecessary. Also, they don't want the kid to feel like she needs that much work to be beautiful. The partner's side: wants her to look presentable and learn early.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the daughter is two. At that age, she's going to mess up her hair regardless. The parent's time and effort are a factor\u2014they already spend an hour a day on their own hair. The partner's insistence might be about setting a future habit, but maybe it's unrealistic for a toddler. Also, the parent's concern about self-image is valid; making a child feel she needs to spend hours on her looks could be harmful.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility? The partner is the other parent. They might have different parenting styles. The author is fulfilling some parts (washing, brushing), which is enough for a 2-year-old. The partner's complaints might be overreacting. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing practicality and the child's well-being. \n\nSo answer B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
