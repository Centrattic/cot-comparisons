She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not wanting to spend an hour daily on their 2-year-old daughter's hair. The parent has thick hair that takes a long routine. The partner wants the daughter to learn hair care early, but the parent thinks it's unnecessary for a toddler and doesn't want her to feel pressured.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The parent's argument is that the child is too young, the effort is too much, and they don't want to impose beauty standards. The partner wants her to be presentable and learn early. But is it reasonable to expect a two-year-old to maintain a complicated hairstyle? At that age, kids are active, their hair is still developing, and they might not understand the importance yet. Plus, the parent is concerned about the time and money involved.\n\nAlso, the parent is already doing some basic care like washing and brushing, which covers the essentials. The partner's insistence might be more about their own preferences or societal expectations. The parent's stance could be about practicality and the child's well-being. So, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong here. They're prioritizing the child's needs and avoiding unnecessary stress. The partner might need to adjust their expectations for a toddler. So the answer is probably B.\n"
