She has thick ringlets like I do. My hair routine takes a minimum of an hour a day to get my hair looking presentable, and it takes a lot of work.\n\nMy partner repeatedly requests that I do the same hair care routine for our daughter so that she knows how to care for her hair when she\u2019s older. I do some of it, like washing with the right products, brushing, and putting in leave in products, but she\u2019s also 2. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put hours of effort into her hair when she\u2019s just going to run around and ruin it. On top of that, her baby mop top is cute and I don\u2019t want her to feel like she needs to dedicate so much time to her hair to feel beautiful.\n\nMy partner however is insistent that I do her hair and complains constantly when I don\u2019t, even when I explain all of the time and effort and money that goes into it. My partner emphasizes that they want our daughter to look \u201cpresentable\u201d, but I disagree. AITA for refusing?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to do their daughter's hair every day. The author has a daughter who's two years old with curly hair. The author's own routine takes an hour a day and is complicated. The partner wants the author to do the same for the daughter, but the author doesn't think it's necessary for a toddler. The partner is upset when the author doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At two years old, she's very young. The author argues that putting in hours of effort is impractical because the child will mess it up. That makes sense because toddlers are active and don't take care of their hair. The author also mentions that the child's natural hair is cute and doesn't want the child to feel pressured to spend a lot of time on her appearance.\n\nThe partner's argument is about teaching the daughter how to care for her hair for the future and keeping her presentable. But is there a valid point here? Maybe the partner wants to establish habits early, especially if the author's hair is hard to manage. However, is it reasonable to impose an adult's routine on a two-year-old? It seems excessive. The key points here are the age of the child, the practicality of the routine, and the parent's intent to not instill unnecessary pressure.\n\nAlso, the partner is complaining constantly, which might indicate that they're not respecting the author's perspective. The author is trying to balance their own time and resources. The partner's insistence might be overbearing, especially if the author is already doing some parts of the routine.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The partner might need to understand that a toddler's needs are different from an adult's. The author is making a reasonable choice based on the child's age and their own limitations. So the answer would be B.\n"
