I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person got a dog from the shelter for their birthday as a gift from their dad. They love dogs, but their financial situation is bad\u2014they lost their job, have student loans, and can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day and then returned it to the shelter, but the dog had already been returned twice before. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is angry, saying they're selfish and that the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's situation. They were in a tough spot financially. They couldn't afford to take care of the dog, so returning it might be seen as responsible to prevent neglect. However, the dog had been returned twice before, so maybe the shelter is concerned about another return. The dad's reaction is harsh, but is the person wrong to return it if they can't support it?\n\nOn the other hand, the dog was a gift, and returning it might be seen as not taking responsibility. But if they can't afford it, keeping it might lead to neglect in the future. The stepmom's allergy is another factor\u2014they couldn't give it back to the dad's house.\n\nI think the person made a tough decision but did the right thing by returning the dog before it became a problem. They acted out of necessity, not spite. The dad's anger might be misplaced because the person prioritized the dog's well-being given their circumstances. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they made a responsible choice given their situation.\n"
