I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial difficulties (unemployed, paying student loans), they couldn't afford to care for the dog. They returned the dog, which had been returned twice before, and now their dad is angry, and the shelter workers judged them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the person might feel guilty because they returned a dog that was already in a bad situation. The shelter workers mentioned the dog deserves a forever home, which adds to the guilt. But on the other hand, the person is struggling financially and might not be in a position to care for a pet responsibly. Taking on a pet without the means to provide for it can be seen as irresponsible, so returning it might actually be the responsible choice before the situation gets worse. \n\nThe dad's reaction is also a factor. He's upset and calling the person selfish and a bad person. But maybe he didn't consider the daughter's financial reality. The stepmom's allergy is a complicating factor because they can't take the dog back. So, the daughter had to return it to the shelter, which is the only option left. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a key point here. While it's commendable to want a pet, if you can't afford the costs, it's not fair to the animal to keep them if you can't provide proper care. The person made the decision after a day, showing they tried to figure it out but realized it wasn't feasible. \n\nHowever, the shelter workers judged them, which might be because the dog has been returned twice already. Maybe the shelter is under pressure to find homes, so returning a dog that's already been returned might be seen as contributing to the problem. But the person's main concern was their financial situation. \n\nThe person is feeling guilty, which suggests they care about the dog's well-being. They didn't want to be in a situation where they couldn't take care of the dog. So, maybe their actions were in the dog's best interest to avoid neglect later. \n\nBut is returning the dog the right decision? If they couldn't find another home, like a friend or family member, maybe they should have tried harder. However, they mentioned their stepmom's allergy, so returning to the dad isn't an option. The shelter might be the only option left. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. The person might have rushed into it without considering the financial aspect, especially since they lost their job. But they acted quickly upon realizing the problem. \n\nOverall, the person might not be in the wrong because they made a difficult decision considering their circumstances. However, maybe they should have thought about the financial commitment before accepting the dog. But given the situation, returning it to avoid neglect could be seen as the right choice. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should also consider that the dad's anger is partly due to not considering the daughter's situation. The person isn't selfish; they're trying to manage their own hardships. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
