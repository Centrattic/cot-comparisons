I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person got a dog from a shelter as a birthday present from their dad. They love dogs, but their financial situation is bad right now\u2014they lost their job, are paying off student loans, and can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day and then returned it to the shelter because they couldn't take care of it. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before and was supposed to have a forever home. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and a bad person, and saying the dog might get put down because of them. The person feels guilty but didn't want to have a pet they couldn't afford.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious what I think. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Returning an animal to a shelter because of financial inability isn't ideal, but it's also a real-life situation where someone can't provide for a pet. The person tried to keep the dog for a day before realizing they couldn't handle the costs. They couldn't return it to their dad because of their stepmom's allergies. So, they had no other option.\n\nThe shelter workers judged them, which might be because the dog has been returned before. But that doesn't necessarily make the person wrong. They were being honest about their inability to care for the dog. The dad's anger is also a factor. The dad might have expected the person to figure it out financially, but expecting someone in a financial crisis to take on more debt could be unrealistic. \n\nOn the other hand, taking a pet from a shelter is a commitment. If they couldn't take on the responsibility, maybe they shouldn't have taken the dog in the first place. But the person didn't know their financial situation beforehand\u2014they lost their job recently. So, maybe it was a genuine unforeseen circumstance. \n\nThe guilt the person feels shows they care about the dog's well-being. They didn't just abandon the dog; they tried to return it to the shelter. The shelter might have other options for the dog. The dad's reaction seems harsh, maybe not considering the person's financial struggles. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? They made a tough decision because of real financial constraints. They didn't want to neglect the dog. The dad's expectations might not be reasonable given the circumstances. The shelter workers' judgment is part of the system's issue with high return rates, but that's not the person's fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong because they made a responsible choice to not take on a commitment they couldn't afford. The dad and shelter workers might not be considering the person's situation. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
