I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for returning a dog they got as a birthday gift from their dad. The main points are financial issues, the dog being returned to a shelter, and the reactions from the shelter workers and their dad.\n\nFirst, the person lost their job and is struggling financially. They mention they can't afford vet bills, food, etc. So they made the decision to return the dog to the shelter. They tried to keep it for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. The stepmom is allergic, so can't take the dog back. \n\nThe shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and saying the dog might get put down. The person feels guilty but didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't handle.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they took in the dog but couldn't afford to care for it. Returning a pet is a serious decision, but if someone can't provide proper care, maybe it's better to return it than to neglect it. The shelter exists to find new homes, so maybe the author did the right thing by giving the dog a chance to be placed elsewhere. However, the dog had been returned twice, so maybe the author's action contributed to that. But the person's situation is valid\u2014financial hardship is real, and they aren't responsible for their job loss or student loans.\n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh, expecting them to use credit cards which might create more debt. The author's intention was to avoid neglect, which is a responsible move. So, considering all factors, the author likely isn't in the wrong because they made a difficult decision based on their circumstances. The answer would be B.\n"
