I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial difficulties after losing a job, they returned the dog to the shelter. The parent is upset, saying they should have used credit cards to figure it out, and the shelter workers judged them too. The person feels guilty but didn't want to take on a pet they couldn't afford.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person loves dogs but couldn't afford the costs. They kept the dog for a day before returning it, which is a short time. The stepmom is allergic, so they couldn't return it to their dad. The shelter workers mentioned the dog has been returned twice before and was looking for a forever home. The parent is angry and making strong accusations about selfishness and cruelty.\n\nThe main question is whether returning the dog was wrong. Let's think about responsibilities. Adopting a pet is a long-term commitment, not just a temporary one. The person took the dog on as a gift, so they have a responsibility to care for it. However, their financial situation is dire. But, maybe they should have communicated with their dad before taking the dog, or tried to find another solution. The shelter workers' reaction suggests the dog might be at risk of being euthanized, so the person's action could lead to that.\n\nBut wait, the person did try to find a solution quickly. They only kept the dog for a day before returning. Maybe that shows they didn't want to leave it in a bad situation. However, taking on a pet knowing you can't afford it later is a problem. The parent's reaction is harsh, but the person's decision was based on real financial constraints. Is it selfish to not take on a financial burden when you can't support it? Or is it responsible to return the dog quickly before the situation worsens?\n\nEthically, if you can't provide proper care, it's better to return the pet to the shelter. But the father argues that the person should have found a way. The person might have done the right thing by not keeping the dog when they couldn't afford it. However, the act of getting a pet as a gift when they knew their financial situation was unstable could be seen as a mistake. But was the person in the wrong for returning it once they realized it wasn't feasible?\n\nThe answer might depend on the circumstances. If the person had the intention to care for the dog but was blindsided by the costs, maybe not their fault. But if they knew the financial situation was bad and accepted a pet without planning, that's different. The story says they lost their job a couple of months before the birthday, so perhaps when the dad gave the dog, the person's financial issues were already ongoing. If the dad didn't consider their ability to care for the dog, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the person. However, once they accepted the pet, they had a responsibility to either find help or not take it. Returning it quickly might be the lesser evil, but the guilt is there.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often looks at intent and effort. The person made a quick decision to return the dog to prevent neglect, which is responsible. The father's anger is misplaced, but the shelter workers' judgment adds to the person's guilt. The person might not be in the wrong because they're prioritizing the dog's well-being over their own inability to care for it. But some might argue that they should have considered the responsibility before accepting the dog. However, given the immediate return to prevent future neglect, it's a tough call. I think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong, because they acted to protect the dog despite their situation.\n"
