I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for returning a dog to the shelter after receiving it as a birthday gift. The key points here are the author's financial situation, the reasons for returning the dog, and the reactions from family and the shelter staff.\n\nFirst, the author mentions losing their job, struggling with student loans, and not having enough money to cover the dog's expenses like vet bills, food, and toys. This suggests that taking care of the dog would be a financial burden they can't handle right now. They tried keeping the dog for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. They couldn't return it to their dad because of their stepmom's allergies, so they took the dog back to the shelter.\n\nThe shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before, implying the dog is hard to place. The dad is upset, calling the author selfish and a bad person. The author feels guilty but didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't afford.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: returning the dog to the shelter seems responsible in the sense that they didn't want to neglect the animal. However, the timing and the dog's history of being returned might play a role. Taking in an animal with the knowledge that you can't care for it long-term could be seen as irresponsible. On the other hand, the author was in a tough financial spot and made a quick decision to return the dog rather than let it stay in a home that couldn't support it.\n\nThere's also the aspect of not consulting their dad first. Since the dog was a gift, maybe they should have discussed the situation with him before returning it. But the stepmom's allergies made returning it to the dad impossible, so that complicates things.\n\nThe shelter workers' judgment is harsh, but the author's priority was their financial stability. The dad's reaction is emotional, but his suggestion to use credit cards might not be practical. The author's decision to return the dog to the shelter, despite the dog's history, shows they wanted the dog to have a better chance elsewhere rather than keeping it in a home that couldn't support it.\n\nIn terms of ethics, taking an animal you can't support might be considered irresponsible, but returning it quickly could be seen as the right call to prevent neglect. The author's guilt suggests they care about the dog's well-being. However, the decision to return it so soon after adoption might be seen as not fully committing to the responsibility, which could be argued as being in the wrong.\n\nBut given the circumstances\u2014financial hardship, the dog's prior returns, and the stepmom's allergies\u2014it's a tough situation. The author made a difficult choice to prioritize their financial stability and the dog's potential for a better home. So, while the decision is regrettable, it's not necessarily the author's fault. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
