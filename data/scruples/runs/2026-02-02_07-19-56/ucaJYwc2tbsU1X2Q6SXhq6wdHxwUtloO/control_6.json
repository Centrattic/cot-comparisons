I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person in the scenario got a dog as a birthday present from their dad. But then they lost their job and can't afford the dog's expenses. They returned the dog to the shelter, which has happened twice before. Now they're feeling guilty and their dad is upset, saying they're selfish and that the dog might get put down.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The main factors here are financial responsibility and the well-being of the dog. The person was in a tough financial situation, couldn't provide for the dog, and didn't want to take on more debt. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. They couldn't return it to their dad because of allergies, so they took it back to the shelter.\n\nOn one hand, shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. That's a problem because the dog might not be getting a permanent home. The dad is upset too, feeling that the daughter should have found a way to keep the dog. But on the other hand, the person didn't want to neglect the dog by taking it when they couldn't afford it. They made a difficult decision based on their circumstances.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they did what they thought was best for the dog in their situation. They didn't abandon it; they returned it to the shelter where it could potentially be adopted by someone else. However, the fact that the dog was already returned twice might mean that the author's action contributes to the dog's instability. But the author's financial situation is real and they couldn't take proper care of the dog. So it's a tough call. The answer might depend on whether you prioritize the dog's immediate need for a home versus the person's inability to provide long-term care. In this case, maybe the author isn't at fault because they made a responsible decision given their constraints. The shelter is the right place for the dog until a better home is found. So the answer is B.\n"
