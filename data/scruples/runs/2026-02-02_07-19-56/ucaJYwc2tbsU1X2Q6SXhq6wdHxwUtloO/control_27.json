I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. The situation is that they received a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial difficulties\u2014losing a job, paying off student loans\u2014they couldn't afford the dog's needs. They returned it to the shelter, which had already returned the dog twice before. Their dad is angry, calling them selfish and saying the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's circumstances. They lost their job, are struggling financially, and can't afford vet bills, food, etc. It's a tough spot. They didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't handle. Then there's the fact that the dog had already been returned twice, which might mean it's harder to rehome now. The shelter staff judged them, but the person did return the dog instead of keeping it, which shows they care about the dog's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, their dad feels betrayed and is upset, thinking they should have found a way to keep the dog. He suggests using credit cards, which might not be the best financial advice, but that's his perspective. The person didn't want to burden their stepmom with allergies either, so returning to the shelter was the only option.\n\nLegally and ethically, giving up a pet isn't against the law here. The person isn't keeping the dog if they can't care for it. The key issue is whether they were selfish. They made a difficult decision based on their current inability to provide proper care, which is a valid reason. However, the dog's previous returns might mean it's at higher risk of euthanasia now, which adds guilt for the person. But they didn't know that when they returned it. They tried to figure things out and realized it wasn't feasible.\n\nSo, considering all factors: financial hardship, inability to care for the pet, and trying to do the right thing by returning it rather than abandoning it, the person isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
