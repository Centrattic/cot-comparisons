I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to the shelter. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the main points: The person's dad got them a dog from a shelter as a birthday present. The person loves dogs but is in a bad financial situation\u2014job loss, student loans, can't afford vet bills, etc. They kept the dog for a day, then returned it because they couldn't take care of it. The shelter staff judged them, the dog was returned twice before, and the dad is furious, saying they're selfish and the dog might be put down. The author feels guilty but didn't want to take on a pet they couldn't afford.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. Ethically, taking in a pet is a big commitment. If you can't afford or provide for it, getting one might be irresponsible. But in this case, the dog was a surprise from the dad. The person didn't ask for it, so maybe that's a factor. They tried to figure it out but realized they couldn't, which is responsible. They didn't keep the dog out of spite or neglect but because of financial constraints. However, the shelter workers and the dad are upset, especially because the dog was already returned twice. The dad might see it as a betrayal, but the person's circumstances are real.\n\nAnother angle: The responsibility of pet ownership. Adopting a pet without the means to care for it is a problem. But the person didn't adopt the dog themselves; it was given to them. They might not have had a choice. The shelter workers' judgment is because they want the dog to have a forever home, but the person is in a tough spot. The dad's anger might stem from not considering the financial situation, but he's also upset because the dog might be euthanized. \n\nThe key here is intent. The person didn't take the dog with the intention to abandon it. They tried to handle it, but their situation was dire. On the other hand, taking on a pet without the ability to care for it is still a problem. But since it was a gift, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on the recipient. The dad might have known the person's financial state but still got the dog, which complicates things. \n\nIn some cases, people return pets when they can't care for them, which is better than neglecting. Shelter workers might prefer that, even if it's hard on the animal. The guilt the person feels shows they care, which is a positive sign. The dad's reaction might be harsh, especially suggesting credit cards and ignoring the person's financial reality. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they had the means, they would have kept the dog. But they didn't, so returning it might be the responsible choice. However, the shock here is that the dog was a gift, and the person didn't ask for it. The real issue might be the dad's decision to get the dog without considering the recipient's ability to care for it. The person's guilt is valid, but they made a tough decision based on their circumstances. \n\nThe answer depends on whether taking a pet as a gift without the ability to care for it is the person's fault. If the dad knew their financial situation, maybe he's at fault. But if the person didn't consider their situation before accepting, maybe they are. But the story says they tried to figure it out but couldn't. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they acted responsibly given their circumstances, even if it's a difficult decision.\n"
