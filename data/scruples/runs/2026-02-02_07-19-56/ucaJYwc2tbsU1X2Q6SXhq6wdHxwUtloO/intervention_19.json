I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but they lost their job and can't afford the dog's expenses. They returned the dog to the shelter, and now they're feeling guilty. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the person's situation: financial instability, job loss, student loans. These are real challenges. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized they couldn't manage the costs. That seems like they made an effort but found it impossible.\n\nThe stepmom's allergy is a factor too. They couldn't return the dog to their dad because of that, so the shelter was the only option. The shelter workers were judgmental, saying the dog was returned twice and deserved a forever home. The dad is angry, calling the person selfish and bad, suggesting they should have used credit cards to \"figure it out.\"\n\nOn one hand, the person didn't want to take in a pet they couldn't support. That's responsible. Taking on a pet is a long-term commitment, and not being able to provide care could be seen as neglectful. But on the other hand, they tried to find a solution quickly when they realized the situation was unsustainable. The guilt they feel shows they care about the dog's well-being.\n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh. He's implying the person should have taken on more debt, which might not be the best advice financially. The shelter workers' judgment adds to the stress, but the person's responsibility was to their own financial health and the dog's welfare.\n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong. They made a tough decision with the information and resources they had. They didn't keep the dog when they couldn't provide proper care. So, answer B.\n"
