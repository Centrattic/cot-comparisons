I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for returning a dog they got as a birthday gift from their dad to a shelter. The situation is that they couldn't afford to care for the dog due to financial issues\u2014lost job, student loans, etc. They returned it after a day, but the shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. Their dad is upset, saying they're selfish and that the dog might get put down.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Taking in a pet is a big responsibility. The dad gave the dog as a gift, expecting them to care for it. The author felt they couldn't provide proper care due to financial constraints. But is that a valid reason?\n\nFinancial hardship can be a legitimate reason. Pets need food, vet care, which can be expensive. If someone can't afford it, keeping the pet might not be responsible. However, the author had to return it to the shelter, and the dog had already been returned twice before. The shelter workers might be frustrated because that dog is at higher risk of not finding a home now. Also, the dad's reaction is harsh, but the author might have considered their own limitations.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad might have thought he was giving a thoughtful gift, not considering the daughter's current financial state. The daughter might have agreed to take the dog without realizing the financial burden. But once she realized she couldn't handle it, returning it was the responsible choice. The guilt comes from the dad's anger and the shelter's judgment, but maybe she did the right thing to avoid neglecting the dog later.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they took the dog knowing they couldn't afford it, that's a problem. But if they took it in good faith, then realized their circumstances changed, returning it quickly might be better. The answer likely depends on whether they took the dog intending to take care of it and then could no longer do so, which might be understandable. But some might argue that getting a pet is a long-term commitment, so returning it quickly is wrong. But given the financial situation, maybe the author is not in the wrong.\n"
