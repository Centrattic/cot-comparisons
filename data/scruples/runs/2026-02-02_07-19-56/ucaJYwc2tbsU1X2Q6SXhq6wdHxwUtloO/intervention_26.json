I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for returning a dog they got as a gift to a shelter due to financial difficulties.\n\nFirst, the context: the author received a dog from their dad as a birthday present. They lost their job, are struggling financially, and can't afford the dog's expenses. They returned the dog to the shelter, which had already returned the dog twice before. The dad is upset, accusing the author of being selfish and potentially leading to the dog's euthanasia.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want a second opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author might feel they had no choice due to financial constraints. On the other, the dog was a gift, and returning it might be seen as breaking a commitment. However, the key points here are that the author couldn't afford to care for the dog, which is a significant responsibility. Also, the shelter had already returned the dog twice, which might mean the author wasn't the first to struggle with it. The dad's anger might stem from the emotional aspect of giving a living gift, but the author's responsibility is to ensure the dog is properly cared for, not just keep it if they can't provide for it. \n\nEthically, it's better to return a pet to the shelter rather than neglect it. The author might have done the right thing by not keeping the dog in poor conditions. The dad's suggestion to open credit cards is impractical and could lead to more financial issues. The author's decision, while painful, might be the responsible choice given their circumstances.\n"
