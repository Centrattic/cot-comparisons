I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about returning a dog given by their dad to a shelter because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author lost their job, has student loans, and can't afford the dog's expenses. They kept the dog for a day, then returned it to the shelter. The dad is upset, saying they're selfish and that the dog might be put down. The shelter workers also judged them because the dog was returned twice before.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The author's main argument is they can't afford to care for the dog, so they don't want to take on a responsibility they can't handle. On the other hand, the father believes they should have found a way, maybe using credit cards, and the shelter workers think the dog deserves a forever home.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Financial hardship is a real issue. People can't always take on additional responsibilities if they can't afford them. But pets are a commitment, and giving up a pet can have consequences, both for the animal and the person's sense of responsibility.\n\nIs the author at fault for prioritizing their financial situation over keeping the dog? Or is it understandable to return a pet they can't support? Also, the father's reaction is harsh, but maybe he's coming from a place of concern for the dog. The shelter's judgment adds another layer, as the dog has been returned before, which might affect its chances of being rehomed.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. If someone knows they can't afford or care for it, maybe they shouldn't take it. But in this case, the dog was a surprise gift, so the author might not have had a choice. However, they did take it for a day before returning, which might show they quickly realized they couldn't handle it. That could be seen as responsible, as they didn't keep the dog longer if they couldn't care for it properly.\n\nThe father's criticism about using credit cards might not be realistic if the author is already in a financial struggle. Opening more credit cards could lead to more debt. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for making a difficult decision based on their circumstances.\n\nAnother angle: the stepmom's allergy means the dog can't go back home. So the author didn't have another option but to return it to the shelter. That might be a mitigating factor. If there was another option, maybe the situation is different. But since there wasn't, returning to the shelter might be the only responsible choice.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author feels guilty and there's criticism from others, their decision is based on practical financial constraints and lack of alternatives. They took quick action to return the dog rather than neglecting it. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
