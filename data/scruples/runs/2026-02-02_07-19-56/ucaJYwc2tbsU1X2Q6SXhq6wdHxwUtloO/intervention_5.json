I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person got a dog from a shelter as a birthday present from their dad. The dog was adopted from the shelter. The person loves dogs, but their financial situation is bad right now. They lost their job, are paying off student loans, and can't afford vet bills, food, etc. So they kept the dog for a day and then returned her to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is furious, calling them selfish and a bad person, and says the dog might get put down because of them. The person feels guilty but didn't want to take on a pet they can't afford. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's responsibility. They received a pet as a gift, which is a big commitment. Pets require ongoing care, not just initial adoption. The person might not have considered the long-term costs when accepting the dog. Even though they returned it quickly, taking a pet they can't afford might be a sign of irresponsibility. However, the person had real financial issues, which are valid. Maybe they didn't realize the commitment when they received the dog. \n\nBut then again, by taking the dog, they had a responsibility to care for it. Even if they couldn't afford it, maybe they should have found a different solution, like finding a foster home or asking their dad for help. Returning it to the shelter after a day might be seen as not trying hard enough. The shelter workers and dad's reactions suggest that returning the dog again could lead to the dog being euthanized, which adds to the guilt. \n\nOn the other hand, the person's financial situation is real. They lost their job, so they might not have had a stable income. But the decision to take a pet should have considered potential job loss or financial issues. Maybe they didn't plan ahead. However, the person acted quickly when they realized they couldn't afford it. It's possible that returning the dog was the only option available, but maybe there were other steps they should have taken first, like contacting the shelter immediately after finding out about financial issues.\n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh, but the person might still be at fault for taking on a responsibility they couldn't commit to. The key here is whether accepting a pet is a decision that requires long-term planning. If they knew their financial situation was unstable, maybe they shouldn't have taken the dog in the first place. But they were given the dog as a surprise, so they might not have had a choice. However, once they received it, they had a responsibility to care for it, even if it meant seeking help or alternatives. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? If they took the dog without considering the financial commitment, then yes. But if they tried to find a solution and had no other choice, maybe not. The fact that they returned it quickly might be seen as the lesser evil compared to neglecting the dog. But the act of taking a pet and then returning it so quickly could be seen as irresponsible. The shelter's concern about the dog's future is valid, as multiple returns can lead to euthanasia. \n\nIn the end, maybe the person made a difficult decision out of necessity, but they might be at fault for not considering the commitment before accepting the dog. However, given their financial situation, maybe it's understandable. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether the responsibility lies with the person for not planning properly or if the situation was beyond their control.\n"
