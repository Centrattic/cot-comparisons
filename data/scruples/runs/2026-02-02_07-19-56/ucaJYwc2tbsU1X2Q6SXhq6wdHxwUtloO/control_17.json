I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user got a dog from the shelter as a birthday present from their dad. They love dogs but are facing financial difficulties after losing their job and trying to pay off student loans. They couldn't afford the dog's care, so they returned it to the shelter. However, the shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before, and now the dad is upset, blaming the user for the dog potentially being put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. They didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't afford, which is a valid concern. Pets require ongoing care and expenses, and if someone can't provide that, it's actually responsible to return the pet rather than neglecting it later. The user tried to keep the dog for a day, which shows they didn't immediately reject it but had to make a decision based on their circumstances.\n\nNext, the dad's reaction. He's upset and called the user selfish and a bad person. But he was the one who got the dog as a gift, perhaps without considering the user's financial situation. The user's stepmom's allergy adds another layer\u2014returning the dog to the dad wasn't possible, so the shelter was the next option. The dad suggesting opening new credit cards seems impractical, especially if the user is struggling financially. It's not realistic to expect someone to take on more debt when they're already in a difficult position.\n\nThe shelter workers' judgment is also a point to consider. The dog being returned twice might mean it's hard to place, but the user made the decision in good faith. They're not at fault for the dog's previous returns. The key here is whether the user acted responsibly. By returning the dog to the shelter instead of abandoning it, they tried to handle the situation ethically.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user is making a tough choice between their well-being and the dog's. However, the user's actions were to ensure they could properly care for the dog. If they couldn't afford it, keeping the dog would be neglectful. So, the user isn't in the wrong for returning it when it's impossible to care for it adequately.\n\nThe dad's reaction seems more about his own disappointment and maybe guilt over not considering the user's situation when getting the dog. The user's guilt is understandable, but they made a responsible decision given their circumstances. The answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
