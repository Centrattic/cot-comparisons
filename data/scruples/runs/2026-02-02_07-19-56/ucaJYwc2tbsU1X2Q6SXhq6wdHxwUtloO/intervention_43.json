I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for returning a dog to the shelter after receiving it as a birthday gift. The situation is that the person is in a tough financial situation, lost their job, and can't afford the dog's needs. The dad is upset, and the shelter workers judged them. The author feels guilty and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the author's financial instability, the fact that the dog was a surprise gift from the dad, the stepmom's allergy, and the emotional impact on the family. \n\nThe author's reasoning for returning the dog is based on their inability to provide proper care due to financial constraints. They didn't want to neglect the dog, which is a responsible stance. However, the dad is angry and feels the author is selfish, possibly because they didn't try to find another solution, like getting a credit card. The shelter workers mentioned the dog being returned twice and the risk of euthanasia, which adds to the author's guilt.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, taking on a pet is a serious commitment, and the author didn't plan for it, which might suggest they were unprepared. On the other hand, the author's financial situation is dire, and they made a tough decision to ensure the dog isn't neglected. The fact that they kept the dog for a day and then returned it shows they tried but realized it wasn't feasible. The stepmom's allergy complicates returning the dog to the dad's home.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is not being negligent by returning the dog to the shelter, even if it's a difficult decision. The shelter is the appropriate place for the dog to be rehomed. However, the lack of communication with the dad beforehand might be a point of contention. The dad might feel the author didn't consider alternatives or didn't discuss the situation before returning the dog.\n\nThe author's decision is a matter of personal responsibility and ethical choices. While the outcome (the dog possibly being euthanized) is sad, the author's intention was to avoid neglect. The shelter is meant to place the dog in a better situation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a tough decision based on their circumstances. However, there might be some fault in not communicating better with the father or exploring all options first. But given the constraints, the decision seems responsible.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a hard choice to prioritize the dog's well-being given their financial situation, even though it caused family conflict and guilt.\n"
