I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who returned a dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the person got a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial difficulties\u2014unemployment and student loans\u2014they couldn't afford the dog's expenses. They returned it to the shelter, and now they're facing judgment from the shelter workers and their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person's financial situation is really bad. They lost their job and are struggling to pay their own bills. Taking care of a pet is a big responsibility, especially when you need to cover vet bills, food, and other necessities. The person didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't handle, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the dad is upset because he thought the dog was a gift, and the person returned it. The shelter workers also felt the dog deserved a forever home. The dad is accusing the person of being selfish and causing the dog to be put down. But the person didn't take the dog on with bad intentions; they realized they couldn't provide proper care and tried to return it. \n\nI think the main ethical issue here is whether it's wrong to return a pet when you can't afford it. But the person is in a position where they can't support their own needs, let alone a pet. Choosing not to take on a responsibility that you can't handle isn't selfish\u2014it's responsible. The dad might not understand the financial strain, but that's his perspective. The person made a tough decision to avoid neglecting the animal, which is actually the right thing to do. \n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong because they made a responsible choice to not put the dog in a bad situation. The real issue here is the dad's reaction and the shelter's judgment without considering the person's circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
