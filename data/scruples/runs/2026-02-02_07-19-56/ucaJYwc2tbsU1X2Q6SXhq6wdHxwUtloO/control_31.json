I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. The situation is that the person got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial issues, they returned it to the shelter. The dad is upset, saying they're selfish and that the dog might be put down. The person is feeling guilty.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the person's financial situation and their decision to return the dog. The dog was a gift, but they couldn't afford the care. They tried to keep it for a day but realized they couldn't. The shelter workers judged them because the dog was returned twice before. The dad is angry and blames them for the dog's possible fate.\n\nSo, should the person have kept the dog? Well, taking on a pet is a big responsibility. If they can't afford the vet bills, food, etc., then maybe it's not in the dog's best interest to stay. However, returning a pet can be seen as irresponsible if they didn't have a backup plan. The fact that the dog was returned twice before complicates things. The shelter workers probably wanted a forever home, so returning it again might not be ideal.\n\nBut the person's financial situation is real. They lost their job and are paying off loans. They might not have the means to care for the dog. The dad's reaction is harsh, but perhaps he didn't consider the financial strain. The person tried to figure it out but realized they couldn't. They didn't give the dog back to the dad because of the stepmom's allergies. So maybe there was no other option. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, adopting a pet is a long-term commitment. If they couldn't commit, maybe they shouldn't have taken it in the first place. However, the situation arose after receiving the dog, and they made a difficult decision based on their circumstances. \n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong because they made a tough choice considering their financial reality. They didn't want to neglect the dog, so returning it to the shelter was better than not being able to care for it. The guilt they feel shows they care about the dog's well-being. The answer is B.\n"
