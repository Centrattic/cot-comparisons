I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to the shelter. The main points are the person's financial struggles after losing a job, the stepmom's allergies, and the dad's anger.\n\nFirst, the author received a dog as a gift. They tried to keep it for a day but couldn't afford the expenses. They returned the dog to the shelter because they couldn't support it financially and couldn't give it back to their dad. The shelter workers were judgmental, and the dad is upset, blaming the author for the dog possibly being put down.\n\nI need to consider if the author made the wrong choice. On one hand, they didn't have the means to care for the dog, which is a big responsibility. They returned it quickly, maybe not giving it time to adjust. On the other hand, they were in a tough financial situation and didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't handle. The dad's reaction seems harsh, suggesting he didn't consider the daughter's circumstances beyond his own wishes.\n\nThe stepmom's allergies are a valid reason they can't take the dog back. The author's decision was based on practicality\u2014financial inability versus the dog's well-being. The shelter workers might think the dog deserves a home, but if the author couldn't provide one, maybe returning it was necessary to avoid neglect. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. If you know you can't afford it, getting a dog isn't responsible. But the author didn't choose to get the dog; it was a gift from the dad. The dad might share some responsibility for not considering the daughter's ability to care for the dog. However, the author did return it quickly upon realizing they couldn't support it. \n\nIn some ways, the author is acting in the dog's best interest by not keeping it if they can't provide proper care. The guilt comes from the dad's blame, but the author's decision was based on real financial constraints. The answer might depend on cultural views on responsibility and gift-giving. If the author had the means to take out a loan or use credit cards, maybe they should have tried. But with the stepmom's allergies, returning to the dad wasn't an option. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. They returned the dog after a short period, tried to figure things out, and didn't want to neglect the animal. The dad's expectation that they should have \"figured it out\" financially, possibly through credit, seems unrealistic given the author's job loss and financial situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
