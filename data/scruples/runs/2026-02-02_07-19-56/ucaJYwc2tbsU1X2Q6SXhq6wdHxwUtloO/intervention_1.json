I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. The situation is that the person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial difficulties\u2014unemployment, student loans\u2014they couldn't afford to take care of it. They returned the dog to the shelter, which had already been returned twice before. The dad is upset, and the shelter workers judged them. The person feels guilty and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. The person is in a tough financial situation. They lost their job, are paying off student loans, and can't afford the dog's expenses. They took the dog for a day, realized they couldn't care for it, and returned it. The stepmom is allergic, so returning it to the dad wasn't an option. The shelter workers were judgmental because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is angry, accusing the person of selfishness and cruelty.\n\nNow, thinking about responsibility. When you take on a pet, especially from a shelter, it's a long-term commitment. But the person wasn't expecting the dog as a gift. They might have accepted it without fully considering their financial stability. However, they did try to figure it out for a day and realized they couldn't commit. Returning the dog might be seen as responsible to avoid neglect, but it's also hard because the dog has a history of being returned.\n\nThe key points are the person's financial situation and the dog's circumstances. On one hand, they might have accepted the dog without the means to care for it, leading to the return. On the other hand, they made the difficult decision to return it to prevent ongoing neglect. The shelter workers' judgment is about the dog's history, but the person's situation is real. The dad's anger might be misplaced since he gave the dog as a gift without considering the financial realities.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a tough call. Being in a financial crisis is a valid reason not to take on a pet. However, getting a pet is a commitment, and perhaps they should have declined the gift if they couldn't afford it. But they weren't given a choice; it was a surprise. So they had to deal with it. Their action might be seen as responsible in the long run, even if it's emotionally difficult.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the person acted irresponsibly by accepting a pet they couldn't afford. But since it was a surprise gift and they quickly realized they couldn't care for it, maybe they're not at fault. Alternatively, they might have been in the wrong for not considering their financial stability before accepting the dog. However, the situation is complex. The person might not be in the wrong because they prioritized the dog's well-being by returning it before things got worse, even though it was a hard decision. The dad's expectations and the shelter's judgment add to the guilt, but the person's financial situation is a valid factor. So, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
