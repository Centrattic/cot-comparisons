I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong for returning a dog they got for their birthday. The person's dad got them a dog from a shelter, but they couldn't afford it because they lost their job and have student loans. They kept the dog for a day, then returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and saying the dog might get put down.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person loves dogs but is in a bad financial state. They didn't want to take on a pet they couldn't properly care for. Returning the dog after a day shows they tried but realized they couldn't handle it. However, the shelter might have been reluctant because the dog was already returned twice. The dad's reaction is harsh, implying they should have taken on more debt. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility, financial capability, and the intentions of the person. Taking in a pet is a long-term commitment, and if they knew they couldn't afford it, maybe they shouldn't have accepted it. But the surprise element complicates things. The person didn't ask for the dog but felt obligated. The stepmom's allergy is another factor, so they couldn't return it to their dad's home. \n\nIs the person at fault for not considering the financial aspects before accepting the dog? They did try to figure it out but realized it wasn't possible. On the other hand, once a pet is given, the person is responsible for it, even if it's a surprise. The shelter's judgment might be because the dog is already in bad standing, and returning pets multiple times isn't ideal. But the person's decision was based on real circumstances. \n\nThe dad's anger seems misplaced because he pushed the responsibility onto his child without considering their situation. The person didn't want to be in a position where they couldn't care for the dog, which is a responsible stance. The shelter might have options to rehome the dog, so maybe the dog isn't necessarily going to be put down. \n\nSo, the person's guilt is valid, but they made a tough decision due to financial constraints. The answer depends on whether taking on a pet without the means is considered wrong. Some might say they should have accepted the challenge, while others see the practicality. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. The correct answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they prioritized their financial reality and the dog's well-being by returning it to the shelter rather than leaving it in a bad home.\n"
