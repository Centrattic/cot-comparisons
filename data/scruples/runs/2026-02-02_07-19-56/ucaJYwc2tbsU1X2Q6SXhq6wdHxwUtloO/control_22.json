I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. The situation is that they got a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial difficulties\u2014job loss, student loans\u2014they couldn't afford to care for the dog. They returned it to the shelter, which had already returned the dog twice before. Both the shelter staff and their dad are upset, with the dad accusing them of being selfish and causing the dog to be put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They love dogs but are in a precarious financial situation. They tried to keep the dog for a day, which shows they didn't immediately give up. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of allergies. Their main concern was not being able to provide proper care, which is a valid reason. The shelter's comment about the dog deserving a forever home adds pressure, but the person's responsibility is to ensure the dog isn't neglected. \n\nOn the other hand, the dad's reaction is harsh. Expecting someone to take on more debt (like opening credit cards) to keep a pet might not be realistic. The person isn't in a position to promise long-term care, so returning the dog prevents future neglect. The shelter taking in a dog that's been returned before might have resources or other options for placement. \n\nEthically, it's better to return a pet if you can't care for it, rather than leave it in a situation where it might suffer. The person acted in the dog's best interest by not keeping it if they couldn't afford the care. While they feel guilty, their decision was responsible given their circumstances. The dad's anger seems more about his own guilt or expectations rather than the dog's welfare. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the person isn't in the wrong. They made a tough choice based on their financial reality and the dog's well-being.\n"
