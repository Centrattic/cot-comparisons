I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog is at fault. The situation is that the person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial difficulties\u2014unemployment and student loans\u2014they couldn't afford the dog's care. They returned the dog to the shelter, which had returned the dog twice before. The dad is upset, and the shelter workers judged them. The person is feeling guilty and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The person didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't afford. Pets are a long-term commitment, and not being able to provide proper care could be seen as irresponsible. However, the person did try for a day and then made a choice to return the dog rather than leave the dog in a bad situation. The stepmom's allergy adds another layer, making it impossible to give the dog back to the dad.\n\nOn the other hand, the shelter workers mentioned the dog has been returned twice. That suggests the dog has a hard time finding a permanent home, which might mean that returning it again could lead to euthanasia. The dad's reaction is harsh, but the person's financial situation is real. They might feel they couldn't take on the debt or financial strain. \n\nIs the person selfish for not taking the dog? It's a tough spot. They did return the dog instead of keeping it in a bad situation, which shows they care. But maybe they should have found another solution, like finding a foster home or a new owner. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone can't afford a pet, getting one isn't ideal. But the dog was a gift, not a purchase. The person might not have had the means at the time. The key points are intent and actions. The person made a difficult decision to return the dog rather than neglect it, which shows they care about the dog's well-being. The guilt suggests they feel conflicted. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say taking on a pet is a commitment one should be ready for, while others understand the financial constraints. Since the person returned the dog to the shelter, they tried to do the right thing despite the possible consequences. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the person isn't entirely in the wrong. They made a hard choice based on their circumstances. The answer would be B (No).\n"
