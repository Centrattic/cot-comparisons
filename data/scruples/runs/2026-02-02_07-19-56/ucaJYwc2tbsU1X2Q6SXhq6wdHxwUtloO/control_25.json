I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person got a dog from a shelter as a birthday present from their dad. They lost their job and have financial issues. They couldn't afford the dog's needs and returned it after a day. The shelter judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and saying the dog might be put down. The person feels guilty but didn't want to be in a position where they couldn't care for the dog.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial hardship, responsibility, and the consequences of returning the dog. The person didn't take the dog on as a permanent commitment but realized they couldn't support it. They tried to figure it out but had to return it. The dad's reaction is harsh, but the person's main issue is their own financial situation.\n\nI need to consider if they're in the wrong. On one hand, adopting a pet is a long-term commitment. The person might have known about the financial challenges before accepting the dog. However, they did take it in for a day and tried to find a solution. The shelter's judgment and the dad's anger add to their guilt.\n\nBut the person's situation is real\u2014they lost their job, can't afford vet bills, etc. They didn't want to neglect the dog, so returning it to the shelter might be the responsible choice despite the dog's previous returns. The shelter's policy might require returning if the owner can't care for the dog. So, while it's tough, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a hard decision based on their circumstances.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the person is making a difficult decision due to financial constraints and didn't want to neglect the dog. The dad's reaction is harsh, but returning the dog when unable to care for it isn't necessarily the person's fault.\n"
