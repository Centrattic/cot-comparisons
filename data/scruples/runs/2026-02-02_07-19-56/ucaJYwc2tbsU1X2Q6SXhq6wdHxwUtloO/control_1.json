I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog is at fault. The situation is that the dad got a dog from a shelter as a birthday present. The person loves dogs but can't afford it financially because they're unemployed and paying off student loans. They kept the dog for a day and then returned it to the shelter because they couldn't handle the costs. The stepmom is allergic, so giving it back to the dad wasn't an option. Now, the shelter workers judged them, saying the dog has been returned twice and might not get another home. The dad is angry, saying they're selfish and the dog might be put down because of them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The choices are A or B. Let's break this down. The author's main argument is financial inability. They mention they lost their job and are struggling with student loans. That's a legitimate hardship. The dad expected them to take on the dog, but the author couldn't commit to the financial responsibility. The stepmom's allergy is another factor that prevents returning the dog to the dad's home.\n\nThe shelter workers' judgment is a point to consider. The dog being returned twice might make it harder for the shelter to place it again, leading to possible euthanasia. However, the author's decision was based on their own inability to care for the dog, which is a valid reason. It's not like they got the dog frivolously and then didn't want the responsibility. The dad's anger is misplaced if he expects someone in financial distress to take on more debt to keep the pet. The author isn't obligated to go into debt to keep an animal they can't properly care for.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to find alternative solutions before returning the dog. Maybe reaching out to the shelter first to explain their situation and see if they could find another foster or adopter. However, the situation was urgent, and they had to make a quick decision. The stepmom's allergy complicates things further, so maybe there wasn't a better immediate option.\n\nEthically, it's a tough spot. Pets are a responsibility that shouldn't be taken lightly, but the author made a decision out of necessity. The key point here is that the author didn't get the dog for themselves but received it as a gift. If they were aware of the financial burden beforehand, maybe they should have declined, but the surprise aspect might make that harder. However, the main reason for returning the dog is the inability to care for it, which is a responsible stance in the long run.\n\nThe dad's reaction seems harsh. Pressuring the author to take out more credit to keep the dog when they're already in financial trouble isn't helpful. The author's priority is their financial stability, which is important for their well-being. So, the answer might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong, as they made a difficult but responsible choice given their circumstances.\n"
