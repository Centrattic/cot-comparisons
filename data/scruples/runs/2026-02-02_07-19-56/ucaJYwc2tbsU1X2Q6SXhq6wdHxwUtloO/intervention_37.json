I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a gift to the shelter. The scenario is that the person got a dog from their dad, but due to financial issues\u2014unemployment, student loans\u2014couldn't afford to take care of it. They kept the dog for a day, then returned it to the shelter. The dad is upset, and the person feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person didn't get a dog on a whim; it was a gift from their dad. They had financial constraints that made it impossible to care for the dog properly. The stepmom's allergy adds another layer, making it impossible to return the dog to the original giver. The person tried to figure out the situation but realized they couldn't afford the responsibilities. Returning the dog to the shelter might have been the only viable option to ensure the dog gets proper care.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad is upset, calling the person selfish. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The person might feel they're abandoning the dog, but their reasoning is based on not wanting to neglect it. \n\nFinancial hardship is a valid reason. Pets require significant resources, and if someone can't provide for them, it's better to find another home. The person didn't keep the dog for long, which shows they tried to make a quick decision. The guilt suggests they care about the dog's well-being. \n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh. Telling someone to open credit cards isn't practical advice if they're already struggling. The person isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability and the dog's welfare by returning it to the shelter instead of leaving it in a situation where it can't be cared for. The shelter can assess if the dog can be rehomed again. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They made a tough decision for the right reasons, considering their inability to care for the dog. The guilt is understandable, but they acted in the dog's best interest given their circumstances.\n"
