I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial issues, they couldn't afford to take care of it. They kept it for a day and then returned it to the shelter. The dad is upset, saying they're selfish, and the shelter workers also judged them because the dog had been returned twice before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person's financial situation is really bad\u2014they lost their job and are paying off student loans. They mention they can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They tried to figure it out but realized it wasn't possible. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of the stepmom's allergies. Also, the shelter workers are judgmental because the dog has been returned twice, and the dad blames them for the dog possibly being put down.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Being in the wrong would mean they did something morally or ethically incorrect. On one hand, the person didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't afford, which is understandable. It's better to return a dog to the shelter than to neglect it. On the other hand, the dog was returned twice before, so maybe the person is contributing to the problem. However, the person acted in good faith, trying to make a responsible decision. The dad's reaction is also harsh, expecting them to take on financial strain. The person's decision was to prevent neglect, which is a valid concern.\n\nI should also think about societal expectations. Pets require long-term commitment. If someone can't commit, perhaps they shouldn't get one. But in this case, the dog was a gift, which complicates things. The person didn't choose to have the dog, so maybe that adds context. They tried to handle it responsibly by returning it quickly. The fact that the shelter workers judged them might indicate that returning a dog, even if necessary, isn't seen as the best option. But the person's circumstances are valid. \n\nAnother angle: Was there any alternative? The stepmom's allergy makes returning to the dad impossible. Maybe they could have tried to find another home, but the person might not have had the time or resources to do that. The immediate action was returning to the shelter, which is a responsible step to ensure the dog gets care elsewhere.\n\nIn terms of the person's guilt, they feel awful, which suggests they acted with good intentions. The dad's anger is more about the outcome than the person's intentions. The dad's suggestion to open credit cards is impractical and irresponsible, adding to the person's correct decision not to take that route.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The person made a tough decision based on their inability to care for the dog properly. They acted to prevent harm to the animal. The judgment from others doesn't necessarily make them wrong. Their intentions were good, even if the situation is difficult. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
