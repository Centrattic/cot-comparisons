I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user presented a situation where someone returned a dog they received as a birthday gift to a shelter because they couldn't afford it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person got a dog from their dad as a birthday present. They lost their job, are struggling financially, and can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day, tried to figure things out but ultimately returned it to the shelter. Their stepmom is allergic, so couldn't give it back to their dad. They faced judgment from shelter workers and their dad is angry, accusing them of selfishness. The person feels guilty but didn't want to have a pet they can't care for.\n\nSo, the main points are financial hardship, the dog being returned, the family's reaction, and the person's feelings of guilt.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The person is in a tough financial situation. Pets are a long-term commitment, and it's irresponsible to take on that responsibility if you can't afford it. Returning the dog after a day shows they tried but couldn't make it work. However, the dog having been returned twice before complicates things. The shelter workers thought the dog deserved a forever home, and the dad is upset, saying the dog might be put down.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, taking on a pet when you can't afford it is a problem. But the person was honest about their situation and tried to find a solution. They didn't keep the dog long-term and returned it to the shelter, which is better than abandoning it. The dad's anger might stem from not considering the person's financial struggles. The stepmom's allergy prevents returning to the original owner. So, the person made a difficult decision based on their circumstances.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, pets require long-term care. But in a situation where someone's financial stability is compromised, they might not be in the right position to take on a pet. The person didn't take the dog on with bad intentions; it was a surprise gift, and they tried to handle it as best as they could. They might not be in the wrong here. The shelter workers' judgment is also a factor, but the person did the right thing by returning it rather than keeping it in poor conditions.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they made a tough decision based on their inability to care for the dog, which is more responsible than keeping it and neglecting it later.\n"
