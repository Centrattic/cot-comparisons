I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they got a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial issues, they returned the dog to the shelter. Now they're feeling guilty and their dad is upset.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author made the right decision. The person lost their job, is paying off student loans, and can't afford vet bills or food. They tried for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. The stepmom is allergic, so they can't give the dog back to their dad. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and a bad person.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they can't financially support the dog. They don't want to take on a responsibility they can't handle. On the other hand, their dad thinks they should've made sacrifices, like using credit cards, to keep the dog. The shelter workers also feel the dog deserved a forever home.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, it's irresponsible to take on a pet if you can't afford it. Pets require ongoing care, and putting a dog back into the shelter system, especially one that's been returned before, might lead to it not getting adopted again. However, the author's situation is dire\u2014unemployed and in debt. They might not be in a position to take on a pet, even if they love animals. \n\nBut maybe they could've found alternatives? Maybe reach out to the shelter for payment plans, or find a foster home temporarily while they looked for work. However, they only kept the dog for a day. Maybe they didn't have time to explore other options. \n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh, but his concern is about the dog's well-being. However, pressuring someone to take on financial burdens they can't handle isn't helpful. The author's guilt comes from not being able to provide for the dog, which is understandable, but they might be overthinking it. \n\nIn the end, the author made a tough decision based on their circumstances. They didn't have the means to care for the dog, so returning it might have been the responsible choice to avoid neglect. However, the fact that the dog was returned twice before complicates things. Maybe the author should've considered that and tried to help in another way, but they couldn't.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They did what they thought was right given their financial situation, but maybe there were other steps they could've taken. However, since they can't afford the dog, returning it to the shelter might be the only option. The dad's anger is misplaced, expecting the daughter to take on financial strain to keep the dog. The author isn't in the wrong for making a difficult decision based on their circumstances.\n"
