I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for returning a dog to the shelter. The author got the dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial issues\u2014unemployment, student loans\u2014they couldn't afford to take care of the dog. They kept it for a day and then returned it to the shelter. Their dad is upset, saying they're selfish and that the dog might get put down.\n\nSo, the main points here are the financial situation and the responsibility of pet ownership. The author argues that they couldn't afford the dog, so returning it was necessary. The dad disagrees, thinks they should have found a way. The shelter workers also judged the author because the dog had been returned before.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they did return the dog after a short time, which could be seen as not taking responsibility. But on the other hand, they were in a tough financial spot and returning the dog might have been the only option to ensure the dog isn't neglected. Also, the author tried to keep it for a day before making the decision, which shows they considered it.\n\nPet ownership is a long-term commitment, so returning a dog can be difficult, especially if it's been returned before. However, the author's situation is challenging. They might not be in the wrong if they made a responsible decision based on their circumstances. The dad's reaction is harsh, suggesting he might not consider the author's financial struggles. The shelter workers' judgment adds another layer, but the author had to make a choice based on their ability to care for the dog.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a tough call. They made a difficult decision, but maybe they could have found another solution before returning the dog. However, given the circumstances, their decision might be justified. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they prioritized their ability to care for the dog and made a tough choice. The author's guilt suggests they care about the dog's well-being, so they're not being selfish. The dad's expectations might be unrealistic given the financial situation. So, B makes sense.\n"
