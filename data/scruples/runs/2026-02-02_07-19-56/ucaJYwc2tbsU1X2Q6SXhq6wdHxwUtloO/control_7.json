I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person got a dog for their birthday from their dad. They love dogs but are going through financial issues. Lost their job, paying off student loans, can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day, tried to figure things out, but realized they couldn't manage. Couldn't return to dad because stepmom is allergic. So they returned it to the shelter. But the shelter workers judged them because the dog was returned twice. Dad is mad, called them selfish, a bad person, and said the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, the person made a tough choice due to their financial situation. They didn't want to neglect the dog. They tried to find a solution but couldn't. Returning the dog to the shelter might be the only option left. But the shelter workers felt the dog deserved a forever home. The dad is upset, but maybe he didn't consider the daughter's financial reality. The person feels guilty but is prioritizing their ability to care for the dog over taking on more debt. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they returned the dog because they couldn't afford it. They didn't abandon it; they returned it to the shelter. The key here is whether they had the responsibility to find a better solution first. But they already tried for a day and couldn't. The stepmom's allergy made returning to the dad impossible. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they didn't keep the dog in bad conditions. They made a choice based on their circumstances. The dad's reaction might be harsh, but the author's decision was out of necessity. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
