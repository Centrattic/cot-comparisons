I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the dad gave a dog from a shelter as a birthday present. The person can't afford it financially, so they returned the dog, but now they're being criticized by the shelter workers and their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They love dogs but can't afford the costs right now. They lost their job, have student loans, and can't support a pet. They tried to figure things out but realized it wasn't feasible. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of allergies. So they returned it to the shelter, which had returned the dog twice before. The shelter workers were judgmental, and the dad is angry, calling them selfish and saying the dog might be put down.\n\nNow, is the person in the wrong? Well, taking on a pet is a big responsibility, including long-term commitment. If someone can't afford it, maybe they should have thought twice before accepting. However, they were given the dog as a surprise by their dad, so maybe they didn't have a choice at the time. Also, the shelter workers said the dog was returned twice, so perhaps the dog's previous owners also couldn't commit, making this situation complicated.\n\nThe dad's anger is understandable, but his solution of opening credit cards might not be realistic. The person did return the dog rather than abandon it, which is responsible. But maybe they didn't explore all options before giving it back. However, given their financial situation, it's a tough spot. \n\nIn terms of ethics, taking an animal as a gift when you can't provide care could be seen as irresponsible. However, the person did return it, which is better than neglect. The guilt they're feeling suggests they care about the dog's well-being. The shelter's concern about the dog being put down adds to the emotional weight. \n\nSo balancing all these factors, maybe the person isn't entirely in the wrong. They acted out of necessity, and the dad's reaction might be harsh. The shelter workers' judgment might not consider the person's financial struggles. However, accepting a pet as a gift without the means to care for it could be seen as a mistake. But considering the circumstances, it's a tough call. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they returned the dog instead of neglecting it and had valid financial reasons. The dad's reaction is part of the problem here too.\n"
