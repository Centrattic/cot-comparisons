I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person received a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial difficulties after losing a job, they couldn't afford to take care of the dog. They returned it to the shelter, which has had the dog returned twice before. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is furious, calling them selfish and a bad person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's situation. They lost their job, have student loans to pay off, and can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of the stepmom's allergies. So, they returned it to the shelter. They feel guilty, and the shelter workers expressed that the dog deserves a forever home. The dad is upset, saying they should have figured it out with credit cards.\n\nNow, the question is whether the person is in the wrong. On one hand, taking in an animal is a big responsibility, and if you can't provide care, it might be seen as irresponsible. But on the other hand, the person is in a difficult financial situation and didn't want to neglect the dog. The shelter workers might have other options to rehome the dog, but the person returned it quickly rather than letting it sit around. The dad's reaction seems harsh, especially suggesting using credit cards which adds to financial stress.\n\nI need to weigh responsibility versus compassion for the person's circumstances. The person did return the dog rather than leaving it in a bad situation. They acted quickly upon realizing the financial strain. The shelter might have other options, but the person didn't have that. The dad's judgment seems unfair given the financial reality. So, the person might not be in the wrong because they tried to make the best decision given their constraints.\n"
