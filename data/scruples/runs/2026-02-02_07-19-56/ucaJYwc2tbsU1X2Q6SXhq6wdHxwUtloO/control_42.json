I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad. However, they're facing financial difficulties after losing their job and can't afford the dog's care. They returned the dog but now feel guilty and face criticism from the shelter workers and their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main arguments. The person's financial situation is a key point. They lost their job, are paying off student loans, and can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day, which might be seen as not enough time to adjust, but they tried to figure out the finances. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of the stepmom's allergies. So, they had to return it to the shelter.\n\nThe shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice and deserved a forever home. The dad is upset, calling them selfish and a bad person. The person feels guilty but didn't want to take on an unaffordable responsibility.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, taking on a pet is a long-term commitment, and returning it after a day seems hasty. People might argue that they should have considered their ability to care for the dog before accepting it. On the other hand, their financial situation is dire, and they didn't want to neglect the dog. They tried to make a responsible decision despite the circumstances. The dad's reaction might be harsh, expecting them to use credit cards, which isn't always a viable or advisable solution.\n\nI should also think about the responsibility of the person giving the dog. The dad surprised them with the dog without checking if they could afford it. That might share some responsibility. Additionally, the person didn't keep the dog as a pet on a whim; they had a valid reason related to their financial stability.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the person might not be in the wrong. They made a tough decision based on their inability to provide proper care, which is a responsible action. The dad's expectations might be unrealistic given the person's current situation. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the person is prioritizing the dog's well-being by not keeping it in an unaffordable situation.\n"
