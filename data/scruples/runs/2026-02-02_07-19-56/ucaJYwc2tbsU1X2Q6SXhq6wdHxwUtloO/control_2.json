I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to the shelter. The situation involves financial difficulties, so I need to consider that aspect.\n\nFirst, the person got a dog from a shelter as a present from their dad. They love dogs but are in a bad financial situation after losing their job and dealing with student loans. They tried to figure things out but couldn't afford vet bills, food, etc. So they returned the dog to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is upset, calling them selfish. The person is feeling guilty but didn't want to take care of a pet they couldn't afford.\n\nNow, I need to determine if they're in the wrong. Legally, once you adopt a dog from a shelter, there's usually a contract, but maybe there's a return policy or the dad's consent. The key points here are the person's financial inability to care for the dog versus the emotional and ethical aspects of returning a pet.\n\nOn one hand, the person is being honest about their financial situation and not wanting to neglect the animal. On the other hand, the shelter workers and the dad feel it's wrong because the dog might be put down again. The person did return it to the shelter, which is a responsible action compared to abandoning the dog elsewhere. But taking on a pet is a long-term commitment, and if they couldn't afford it, maybe they shouldn't have taken it in the first place. However, the dog was a gift from the dad without their consent, so they had to make a decision based on their reality.\n\nThe dad's anger is part of the problem. The person didn't choose to have the dog; it was a surprise. So they have to manage a situation not of their making. The guilt comes from not wanting to neglect the dog, but the financial constraints are real. Shelters often have return policies because they know people might face difficulties. The person's intention was to do what's best for the dog given their circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the person isn't in the wrong because they made a difficult decision based on their financial reality and returned the dog to the shelter responsibly. The wrong isn't on them but perhaps on the dad for giving a pet without considering the child's situation.\n"
