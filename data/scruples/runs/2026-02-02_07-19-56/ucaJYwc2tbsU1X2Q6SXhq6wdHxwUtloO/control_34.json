I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for returning a dog to the shelter. The situation is that the person's dad gave them a dog from a shelter for their birthday. The person lost their job and can't afford the dog's expenses, so they returned it. The shelter workers were judgmental, and the dad is angry, saying they're selfish and that the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is at fault. The key points here are the financial situation, the decision to return the dog, and the dad's reaction. The author explains they can't afford the dog and that they tried to figure it out for a day. They also couldn't return the dog to their dad because of the stepmom's allergies. \n\nFinancial hardship is a real issue. People can't be expected to take on responsibilities they can't afford. The author didn't get the dog for themselves; it was a gift from their dad. But taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. However, the author made a responsible decision by returning it to the shelter instead of abandoning it. The shelter workers' judgment is unfortunate, but the author's main duty is to their own circumstances. \n\nThe dad's reaction seems harsh. Telling someone they should open credit cards to take care of a pet might not be the best advice, especially if the person is already struggling financially. The author's guilt is understandable but doesn't necessarily mean they're in the wrong. They considered the dog's welfare and tried to find a solution. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether returning the dog under these circumstances is justifiable. Since the author couldn't provide proper care and returned it to the shelter, they might not be in the wrong. The dad's anger is misplaced, and the shelter's judgment doesn't absolve the situation but doesn't place blame entirely on the author either. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), because the author made a difficult but responsible decision given their financial constraints.\n"
