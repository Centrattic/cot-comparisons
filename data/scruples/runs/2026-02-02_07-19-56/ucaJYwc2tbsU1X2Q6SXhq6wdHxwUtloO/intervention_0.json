I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they got a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial difficulties, they returned the dog to the shelter. Their dad is upset, and the shelter workers judged them. The person is feeling guilty.\n\nSo, the question is whether they did the wrong thing. Let's break it down. The person received a dog, which they love, but their financial situation is bad\u2014lost job, paying off student loans, can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They tried to keep it for a day but realized it wasn't possible. They couldn't return it to their dad because of allergies. So they returned it to the shelter.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to provide a good home but couldn't due to financial constraints. They didn't want to neglect the dog. The shelter workers said the dog was returned twice, so maybe the dog is a repeat return, which complicates things. The dad is angry, calling the author selfish and cruel. The author feels guilty but made a decision based on financial reality.\n\nNow, considering AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, people often weigh intentions, circumstances, and outcomes. The author's intention was to avoid neglect, which is a good intention. However, the action of returning the dog might be seen as wrong because the dog could end up being euthanized. But the author couldn't support the dog financially, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The dad's reaction is harsh, expecting the author to use credit cards, which might not be responsible. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author's decision was based on their current financial inability to care for the dog. If they had the means, they would keep it, but they don't. Returning a pet isn't ideal, but if it's better for the pet's well-being in the long run, maybe it's understandable. The shelter might have other options, but the author might not know. The guilt comes from the possible euthanasia, but the author isn't directly responsible for that outcome. \n\nHowever, the dog was already returned twice, so maybe the author is just adding to the problem. But the author didn't know that, right? The shelter workers told them after the return. So the author might not have been aware of the dog's history. If they had known, maybe they would have handled it differently. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is honest about their situation. The dad's approach of suggesting credit cards without considering the author's financial struggles could be part of the problem. The author isn't malicious; they're in a tough spot. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that taking in a pet is a commitment, and returning it is wrong regardless of the reason. \n\nBut the key here is the financial inability to care for the dog. If you can't provide for a pet, it's better to return it to prevent future neglect. So the author might be in the right. However, the emotional aspect and the dad's judgment might make it seem like the author is at fault. \n\nSo, after considering all angles, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author made a responsible decision to avoid neglect due to financial hardship, even though it's a difficult and emotional situation.\n"
